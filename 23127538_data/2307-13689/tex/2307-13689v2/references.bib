abstract = {{We present results from two new techniques for the generation of meter-scale, low density ( ∼ 1 0 17 c m − 3 on axis) plasma waveguides, the “two-Bessel” technique, and the “self-waveguiding” technique. Plasma waveguides of this density and length range are needed for demonstration of a ∼10 GeV laser wakefield accelerator module, key for future staging for a ∼TeV lepton collider. Both techniques require the use of high quality ultrashort pulse Bessel beams to efficiently and uniformly ionize hydrogen gas in meter-scale supersonic gas jets via optical field ionization. We review these two techniques, describe our meter-scale gas jets, and present a new method for correction of optical aberrations in Bessel beams. Finally, we briefly present results from recent experiments employing one of our techniques, demonstrating quasi-monoenergetic acceleration of ∼5 GeV electron bunches in 20 cm long, low density plasma waveguides.}},

The compact nature of plasma-based accelerators would allow the realization of table-top machines capable of driving a free-electron laser (FEL)5, a formidable tool to investigate matter at the sub-atomic level by generating coherent light pulses with sub-ångström wavelengths and sub-femtosecond durations6,7. So far, however, the high-energy electron beams required to operate FELs had to be obtained through the use of conventional large-size radio-frequency (RF) accelerators, bound to a sizeable footprint as a result of their limited accelerating fields. Here we report the experimental evidence of FEL lasing by a compact (3-cm) particle-beam-driven plasma accelerator. The accelerated beams are completely characterized in the six-dimensional phase space and have high quality, comparable with state-of-the-art accelerators8. This allowed the observation of narrow-band amplified radiation in the infrared range with typical exponential growth of its intensity over six consecutive undulators. This proof-of-principle experiment represents a fundamental milestone in the use of plasma-based accelerators, contributing to the development of next-generation compact facilities for user-oriented applications9. Using a compact, particle-beam-driven plasma-based accelerator to accelerate high-quality electron beams that are completely characterized in the six-dimensional phase space, free-electron lasing is observed with narrow-band amplified radiation in the infrared range.}},

The recent development of short-wavelength seeded free-electron lasers now allows for unprecedented levels of control on longitudinal coherence, opening new scientific avenues such as ultra-fast dynamics on complex systems and X-ray nonlinear optics. Although those devices rely on state-of-the-art large-scale accelerators, advancements on laser-plasma accelerators, which harness gigavolt-per-centimetre accelerating fields, showcase a promising technology as compact drivers for free-electron lasers. Using such footprint-reduced accelerators, exponential amplification of a shot-noise type of radiation in a self-amplified spontaneous emission configuration was recently achieved. However, employing this compact approach for the delivery of temporally coherent pulses in a controlled manner has remained a major challenge. Here we present the experimental demonstration of a laser-plasma accelerator-driven free-electron laser in a seeded configuration, where control over the radiation wavelength is accomplished. Furthermore, the appearance of interference fringes, resulting from the interaction between the phase-locked emitted radiation and the seed, confirms longitudinal coherence. Building on our scientific achievements, we anticipate a navigable pathway to extreme-ultraviolet wavelengths, paving the way towards smaller-scale free-electron lasers, unique tools for a multitude of applications in industry, laboratories and universities. Researchers demonstrate a laser-plasma accelerator-driven free-electron laser in a seeded configuration, where control over the radiation wavelength and longitudinal coherence are achieved.}},

abstract = {High-power lasers that fit into a university-scale laboratory can now reach focused intensities of more than 10(19) W cm(-2) at high repetition rates. Such lasers are capable of producing beams of energetic electrons, protons and gamma-rays. Relativistic electrons are generated through the breaking of large-amplitude relativistic plasma waves created in the wake of the laser pulse as it propagates through a plasma, or through a direct interaction between the laser field and the electrons in the plasma. However, the electron beams produced from previous laser-plasma experiments have a large energy spread, limiting their use for potential applications. Here we report high-resolution energy measurements of the electron beams produced from intense laser-plasma interactions, showing that--under particular plasma conditions--it is possible to generate beams of relativistic electrons with low divergence and a small energy spread (less than three per cent). The monoenergetic features were observed in the electron energy spectrum for plasma densities just above a threshold required for breaking of the plasma wave. These features were observed consistently in the electron spectrum, although the energy of the beam was observed to vary from shot to shot. If the issue of energy reproducibility can be addressed, it should be possible to generate ultrashort monoenergetic electron bunches of tunable energy, holding great promise for the future development of 'table-top' particle accelerators.},

These applications require a high degree of stability, beam quality and tunability. Here we report on a technique to inject electrons into the accelerating field of a laser-driven plasma wave and coupling of this injector to a lower-density, separately tunable plasma for further acceleration. The technique relies on a single laser pulse powering a plasma structure with a tailored longitudinal density profile, to produce beams that can be tuned in the range of 100-400 MeV with per-cent-level stability, using laser pulses of less than 40 TW. The resulting device is a simple stand-alone accelerator or the front end for a multistage higher-energy accelerator.},

Electrons accelerated up to 300 MeV energies produce a beam of broadband, forward-directed betatron x-ray radiation extending up to 80 keV. The angular resolved spectrum from an image plate-based spectrometer with differential filtering provides data in a single laser shot. The simultaneous spectral and spatial x-ray analysis allows for a three-dimensional reconstruction of electron trajectories with micrometer resolution, and we find that the angular dependence of the x-ray spectrum is showing strong evidence of anisotropic electron trajectories. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

@article{Steinke2016,
abstract = {Laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) are capable of accelerating charged particles to very high energies in very compact structures. In theory, therefore, they offer advantages over conventional, large-scale particle accelerators. However, the energy gain in a single-stage LPA can be limited by laser diffraction, dephasing, electron-beam loading and laser-energy depletion. The problem of laser diffraction can be addressed by using laser-pulse guiding and preformed plasma waveguides to maintain the required laser intensity over distances of many Rayleigh lengths; dephasing can be mitigated by longitudinal tailoring of the plasma density; and beam loading can be controlled by proper shaping of the electron beam. To increase the beam energy further, it is necessary to tackle the problem of the depletion of laser energy, by sequencing the accelerator into stages, each powered by a separate laser pulse. Here, we present results from an experiment that demonstrates such staging. Two LPA stages were coupled over a short distance (as is needed to preserve the average acceleration gradient) by a plasma mirror. Stable electron beams from a first LPA were focused to a twenty-micrometre radius--by a discharge capillary-based active plasma lens--into a second LPA, such that the beams interacted with the wakefield excited by a separate laser. Staged acceleration by the wakefield of the second stage is detected via an energy gain of 100 megaelectronvolts for a subset of the electron beam. Changing the arrival time of the electron beam with respect to the second-stage laser pulse allowed us to reconstruct the temporal wakefield structure and to determine the plasma density. Our results indicate that the fundamental limitation to energy gain presented by laser depletion can be overcome by using staged acceleration, suggesting a way of reaching the electron energies required for collider applications.},

abstract = {We propose and use a technique to measure the transverse emittance of a laser-wakefield accelerated beam of relativistic electrons. The technique is based on the simultaneous measurements of the electron beam divergence given by v/v, the measured spectrum $\gamma$, and the transverse electron bunch size in the bubble r. The latter is obtained via the measurement of the source size of the x rays emitted by the accelerating electron bunch in the bubble. We measure a normalized rms beam transverse emittance <0.5$\pi$mmmrad as an upper limit for a spatially Gaussian, spectrally quasimonoenergetic electron beam with 230 MeV energy in agreement with numerical modeling and analytic theory in the bubble regime.

abstract = {The description of the dynamics of an electron in an external electromagnetic field of arbitrary intensity is one of the most fundamental outstanding problems in electrodynamics. Remarkably, to date there is no unanimously accepted theoretical solution for ultra-high intensities and little or no experimental data. The basic challenge is the inclusion of the self-interaction of the electron with the field emitted by the electron itself - the so-called radiation reaction force. We report here on the experimental evidence of strong radiation reaction, in an all-optical experiment, during the propagation of highly relativistic electrons (maximum energy exceeding 2 GeV) through the field of an ultra-intense laser (peak intensity of $4\times10^{20}$ W/cm$^2$). In their own rest frame, the highest energy electrons experience an electric field as high as one quarter of the critical field of quantum electrodynamics and are seen to lose up to 30\% of their kinetic energy during the propagation through the laser field. The experimental data show signatures of quantum effects in the electron dynamics in the external laser field, potentially showing departures from the constant cross field approximation.},

Recent progress in laser technology has resulted in the realization of a petawatt (PW) femtosecond laser, which offers new capabilities for research on laser-wakefield acceleration. Here, we present a significant increase in laser-driven electron energy to the multi-GeV level by utilizing a 30-fs, 1-PW laser system. In particular, a dual-stage laser-wakefield acceleration scheme (injector and accelerator scheme) was applied to boost electron energies to over 3 GeV with a single PW laser pulse.

abstract = {We report on the first demonstration of passive all-optical plasma lensing using a two-stage setup. An intense femtosecond laser accelerates electrons in a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) to 100 MeV over millimeter length scales. By adding a second gas target behind the initial LWFA stage we introduce a robust and independently tunable plasma lens. We observe a density dependent reduction of the LWFA electron beam divergence from an initial value of 2.3 mrad, down to 1.4 mrad (rms), when the plasma lens is in operation. Such a plasma lens provides a simple and compact approach for divergence reduction well matched to the mm-scale length of the LWFA accelerator. The focusing forces are provided solely by the plasma and driven by the bunch itself only, making this a highly useful and conceptually new approach to electron beam focusing. Possible applications of this lens are not limited to laser plasma accelerators. Since no active driver is needed the passive plasma lens is also suited for high repetition rate focusing of electron bunches. Its understanding is also required for modeling the evolution of the driving particle bunch in particle driven wake field acceleration.},

abstract = {Laser-plasma accelerators can produce high-quality electron beams, up to giga electronvolts in energy, from a centimetre scale device. The properties of the electron beams and the accelerator stability are largely determined by the injection stage of electrons into the accelerator. The simplest mechanism of injection is self-injection, in which the wakefield is strong enough to trap cold plasma electrons into the laser wake. The main drawback of this method is its lack of shot-to-shot stability. Here we present experimental and numerical results that demonstrate the existence of two different self-injection mechanisms. Transverse self-injection is shown to lead to low stability and poor-quality electron beams, because of a strong dependence on the intensity profile of the laser pulse. In contrast, longitudinal injection, which is unambiguously observed for the first time, is shown to lead to much more stable acceleration and higher-quality electron beams. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

@article{Faure2006,
abstract = {In laser-plasma-based accelerators, an intense laser pulse drives a large electric field (the wakefield) which accelerates particles to high energies in distances much shorter than in conventional accelerators. These high acceleration gradients, of a few hundreds of gigavolts per metre, hold the promise of compact high-energy particle accelerators. Recently, several experiments have shown that laser-plasma accelerators can produce high-quality electron beams, with quasi-monoenergetic energy distributions at the 100 MeV level. However, these beams do not have the stability and reproducibility that are required for applications. This is because the mechanism responsible for injecting electrons into the wakefield is based on highly nonlinear phenomena, and is therefore hard to control. Here we demonstrate that the injection and subsequent acceleration of electrons can be controlled by using a second laser pulse. The collision of the two laser pulses provides a pre-acceleration stage which provokes the injection of electrons into the wakefield. The experimental results show that the electron beams obtained in this manner are collimated (5 mrad divergence), monoenergetic (with energy spread <10 per cent), tuneable (between 15 and 250 MeV) and, most importantly, stable. In addition, the experimental observations are compatible with electron bunch durations shorter than 10 fs. We anticipate that this stable and compact electron source will have a strong impact on applications requiring short bunches, such as the femtolysis of water, or high stability, such as radiotherapy with high-energy electrons or radiography for materials science.},

Scaling these compact accelerators to multi-gigaelectronvolt energy would open the prospect of building X-ray free-electron lasers and linear colliders hundreds of times smaller than conventional facilities, but the 1 GeV barrier has so far proven insurmountable. Here, by applying new petawatt laser technology, we produce electron bunches with a spectrum prominently peaked at 2 GeV with only a few per cent energy spread and unprecedented sub-milliradian divergence. Petawatt pulses inject ambient plasma electrons into the laser-driven accelerator at much lower density than was previously possible, thereby overcoming the principal physical barriers to multi-gigaelectronvolt acceleration: dephasing between laser-driven wake and accelerating electrons and laser pulse erosion. Simulations indicate that with improvements in the laser-pulse focus quality, acceleration to nearly 10 GeV should be possible with the available pulse energy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This methodology works well when interferograms are only marginally affected by noise and reduction of fringe visibility, but it can fail to produce accurate phase-shift maps when low-quality images are dealt with. We present a novel procedure for a phase-shift map computation that makes extensive use of the ridge extraction in the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) framework. The CWT tool is flexible because of the wide adaptability of the analyzing basis, and it can be accurate because of the intrinsic noise reduction in the ridge extraction. A comparative analysis of the accuracy performances of the new tool and the FFT-based one shows that the CWT-based tool produces phase maps considerably less noisy and that it can better resolve local inhomogeneties.},

It is known that optical field ionization of atoms using ultrashort laser pulses can generate plasmas with known anisotropic electron velocity distributions. Here, we show that following the ionization but before collisions thermalize the electrons, the plasma undergoes two-stream, filamentation, and Weibel instabilities that isotropize the electron distributions.

Plasma parameters of the waveguide were investigated by use of both a Normarski laser interferometer and a hydrogen plasma line spectrum. A space-averaged maximum temperature of 3.3 eV with electron densities of the order of 10 17 cm-3 was observed at a discharge time of 150 ns and a maximum discharge current of 200 A. One-dimensional dissipative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code was used to analyze the discharge dynamics in the gas-filled capillary discharge waveguide for high-intensity laser pulses. Simulations were performed for the conditions of the experiment. We compared the temporal behavior of the electron temperature and the radial electron density profiles, measured in the experiment with the results of the numerical simulations. They occurred to be in a good agreement. An ultrashort, intense laser pulse was guided by use of this plasma channel. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

At present, lasers generating coherent bandwidths of several hundred nanometers have been demonstrated and correspondingly short pulses of 10 fs or so are quite usual. The limits to the breadth of optical spectra and brevity of pulse durations that may be achieved are often set by the dispersive properties of the linear optical elements of which the source is constructed. Progress in ultrafast optics to date has therefore relied extensively on the development of ways to characterize and manipulate dispersion. The means by which this can be accomplished are significantly different for laser oscillators and laser amplifiers, as well as for nonlinear interactions that are used to extend the range of frequencies at which short optical pulses are available, but in all cases it is this phenomenon that determines the output of current optical sources. {\textcopyright} 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

Lett. 19, 1937 (1994)] in which the channeling of intense laser pulses over distances much greater than a Rayleigh length was demonstrated using a twolaser- pulse technique. The first pulse creates a breakdown spark in a gas target, and the expansion of the resulting hot plasma forms a channel which guides a second pulse, injected into the channel after an appropriate delay. Data are presented for channels of 24 Rayleigh lengths (0.7 cm), while pulses have been channeled up to 70 Rayleigh lengths (2.2 cm), with up to 75\%\%uo of the energy in the injected pulse focal spot coupled into the guide. In spite of the high intensities of the channel beam (here up to 10' W/cm ), the propagation is linear and should remain so at even higher intensities. Single-mode, multimode, and leaky mode propagation of the channeled beam is observed, with the mode structure depending on the delay and the gas density. Along with these experimental results, we present a model of the laser-gas interaction and the resulting plasma hydrodynamics and calculate beam propagation and mode structure in plasma waveguides. A special property of a plasma waveguide is that the mode structure is wavelength independent, resulting in a wavelength-independent guiding condition.},

abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers can generate intense and coherent radiation at wavelengths down to the sub-{\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}m region1–5, and have become indispensable tools for applications in structural biology and chemistry, among other disciplines6. Several X-ray free-electron laser facilities are in operation2–5; however, their requirement for large, high-cost, state-of-the-art radio-frequency accelerators has led to great interest in the development of compact and economical accelerators. Laser wakefield accelerators can sustain accelerating gradients more than three orders of magnitude higher than those of radio-frequency accelerators7–10, and are regarded as an attractive option for driving compact X-ray free-electron lasers11. However, the realization of such devices remains a challenge owing to the relatively poor quality of electron beams that are based on a laser wakefield accelerator. Here we present an experimental demonstration of undulator radiation amplification in the exponential-gain regime by using electron beams based on a laser wakefield accelerator. The amplified undulator radiation, which is typically centred at 27 nanometres and has a maximum photon number of around 1010 per shot, yields a maximum radiation energy of about 150 nanojoules. In the third of three undulators in the device, the maximum gain of the radiation power is approximately 100-fold, confirming a successful operation in the exponential-gain regime. Our results constitute a proof-of-principle demonstration of free-electron lasing using a laser wakefield accelerator, and pave the way towards the development of compact X-ray free-electron lasers based on this technology with broad applications.},

The second phase of evolution occurs after the pulse reaches a minimum length at which point the pulse rapidly lengthens, losing resonance with the plasma. Expressions for the rate of laser energy loss and rate of laser redshifting are derived and are found to be in excellent agreement with the direct numerical solution of the laser field evolution coupled to the plasma response.

The total charge of the high energy electrons produced from self-injection and acceleration in the wakefield was found to depend strongly and asymmetrically on the magnitude and sign of the chirp, which was also corroborated by the forward Raman scattering signals. Generation of low divergence (≤10 mrad), quasimonoenergetic electron beam was observed with a maximum energy of ∼28 MeV for a positively chirped laser pulse of duration ∼70 fs. The observations are explained considering faster rise time associated with a positive chirped laser pulse which generates intense seed for stronger modulation of the laser pulse and consequently stronger wakefield excitation leading to higher electron beam charge and energy.

A finite pulse length leads to a spread in the laser wave number and consequently a spread in betatron wave number. This results in phase mixing and damping of the betatron oscillation. The damping distance characterizing the phase mixing of the betatron oscillation is derived, as is the dispersion distance characterizing the longitudinal spreading of the pulse. {\textcopyright} 1999 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {An overview of two types of beam solutions is presented, Gaussian beams and Bessel beams. Gaussian beams are examples of non-localized or diffracting beam solutions, and Bessel beams are example of localized, non-diffracting beam solutions. Gaussian beams stay bounded over a certain propagation range after which they diverge. Bessel beams are among a class of solutions to the wave equation that are ideally diffraction-free and do not diverge when they propagate. They can be described by plane waves with normal vectors along a cone with a fixed angle from the beam propagation direction. X-waves are an example of pulsed beams that propagate in an undistorted fashion. For realizable localized beam solutions, Bessel beams must ultimately be windowed by an aperture, and for a Gaussian tapered window function this results in Bessel-Gauss beams. Bessel-Gauss beams can also be realized by a combination of Gaussian beams propagating along a cone with a fixed opening angle. Depending on the beam parameters, Bessel-Gauss beams can be used to describe a range of beams solutions with Gaussian beams and Bessel beams as end-members. Both Gaussian beams, as well as limited diffraction beams, can be used as building blocks for the modeling and synthesis of other types of wave fields. In seismology and geophysics, limited diffraction beams have the potential of providing improved controllability of the beam solutions and a large depth of focus in the subsurface for seismic imaging.},

The effects of the RECRs are visualized by imaging the driven plasma wave with a few-cycle, optical probe in transverse geometry. The probe experiences strong, spectrally dependent and relativistically modified birefringence in the vicinity of the pump that arises due to the plasma electrons' relativistic motion in the pump's electromagnetic fields. The spectral birefringence is strongly dependent on the local magnetic field distribution of the pump laser. Analysis and comparison to both 2D and 3D particle-in-cell simulations confirm the origin of the RECR effect and its appearance in experimental and simulated shadowgrams of the laser-plasma interaction. The RECR effect is relevant for any relativistic, magnetized plasma and in the case of LWFA could provide a nondestructive, in situ diagnostic for tracking the evolution of the pump's intensity distribution with propagation through tenuous plasma.},

abstract = {Laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) has emerged as a promising concept for the next generation of high energy electron accelerators. The acceleration medium is provided by a target that creates a local well-defined gas-density profile inside a vacuum vessel. Target development and analysis of the resulting gas-density profiles is an important aspect in the further development of LWFA. Gas-jet targets are widely used in regimes where relatively high electron densities over short interaction lengths are required (up to several millimetres interaction length, plasma densities down to $\sim$1018cm−3). In this paper we report a precise characterisation of such gas-jet targets by a laser interferometry technique. We show that phase shifts down to 4 mrad can be resolved. Tomographic phase reconstruction enables detection of non-axisymmetrical gas-density profiles which indicates defects in cylindrical nozzles, analysis of slit-nozzles and nozzles with an induced shock-wave density step. In a direct comparison between argon and helium jets we show that it cannot automatically be assumed, as is often done, that a nozzle measured with argon will provide the same gas density with helium.},

abstract = {Spatiotemporal control over the intensity of a laser pulse has the potential to enable or revolutionize a wide range of laser-based applications that currently suffer from the poor flexibility offered by conventional optics. Specifically, these optics limit the region of high intensity to the Rayleigh range and provide little to no control over the trajectory of the peak intensity. Here, we introduce a nonlinear technique for spatiotemporal control, the “self-flying focus,” that produces an arbitrary trajectory intensity peak that can be sustained for distances comparable to the focal length. The technique combines temporal pulse shaping and the inherent nonlinearity of a medium to customize the time and location at which each temporal slice within the pulse comes to its focus. As an example of its utility, simulations show that the self-flying focus can form a highly uniform, meter-scale plasma suitable for advanced plasma-based accelerators.},

We are able to measure the laser wave front around the focus and include it in realistic particle-in-cell simulations demonstrating the role of the laser wave front on the acceleration of electrons. Distortions of the laser wave front cause spatial inhomogeneities in the midfield laser intensity and, consequently, the laser pulse drives an inhomogeneous transverse wakefield whose focusing and defocusing properties affect the electron distribution. These findings explain the experimental results and suggest the possibility of controlling the electron spatial distribution in laser-plasma accelerators by tailoring the laser wave front.},

To pump these amplifiers an intense infrared pulse must propagate focused throughout all the length of the amplifier, which spans several Rayleigh lengths. However, strong nonlinear effects hinder the propagation of the laser beam. The use of a plasma waveguide allows us to overcome these drawbacks provided the hydrodynamic processes that dominate the creation and posterior evolution of the waveguide are controlled and optimized. In this paper we present experimental measurements of the radial density profile and transmittance of such waveguide, and we compare them with numerical calculations using hydrodynamic and particle-in-cell codes. Controlling the properties (electron density value and radial gradient) of the waveguide with the help of numerical codes promises the delivery of ultrashort (tens of femtoseconds), coherent soft-x-ray pulses.},

However, the energy spread controlling in this mechanism remains a challenge because continuous injection in a mixed gas target is usually inevitable. Here we propose that by use of certain initially unmatched laser pulses, the electron injection can be constrained to the very front region of the mixed gas target, typically in a length of a few hundreds micro meters determined by laser-driven bubble deformation. Under some optimized conditions, the injection region is well limited within $200\rm \mu m$ and the electron beam with central energy of 383 MeV, energy spread of 3.33\% in FWHM, normalized emittance of 3.12 mm mrad and charge of 14.58 pC can be obtained according to particle-in-cell simulations.

abstract = {Physics considerations for a next-generation linear collider based on laser-plasma accelerators are discussed. The ultrahigh accelerating gradient of a laser-plasma accelerator and short laser coupling distance between accelerator stages allows for a compact linac. Two regimes of laser-plasma acceleration are discussed. The highly nonlinear regime has the advantages of higher accelerating fields and uniform focusing forces, whereas the quasilinear regime has the advantage of symmetric accelerating properties for electrons and positrons. Scaling of various accelerator and collider parameters with respect to plasma density and laser wavelength are derived. Reduction of beamstrahlung effects implies the use of ultrashort bunches of moderate charge. The total linac length scales inversely with the square root of the plasma density, whereas the total power scales proportional to the square root of the density. A 1 TeV center-ofmass collider based on stages using a plasma density of 10 17 cm -3 requires tens of J of laser energy per stage (using 1 $\mu$m wavelength lasers) with tens of kHz repetition rate. Coulomb scattering and synchrotron radiation are examined and found not to significantly degrade beam quality. A photon collider based on laser-plasma accelerated beams is also considered. The requirements for the scattering laser energy are comparable to those of a single laser-plasma accelerator stage. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

Interferometry shows that after 1 ns there is a clear shock structure formed, that can be approximated to a cylindrical blast wave. The shock velocity was measured for plasmas created with linearly and circularly polarized laser beams, indicating an approximately 20\% higher velocity for plasmas generated with a circularly polarized laser beam, thus implying a higher plasma electron temperature. The heating mechanism was determined to be the Above Threshold Ionization effect. The calculated electrum energy spectrum for a circularly polarized laser beam was broader when compared to the one generated by a linearly polarized laser beam, leading to a higher plasma temperature. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {The nonlinear optics of plasmas at relativistic intensities are analyzed using only the physically intuitive processes of longitudinal bunching of laser energy, transverse focusing of laser energy, and photon acceleration, together with the assumption of conservation of photons, i.e., the classical action. All that is required are the well-known formula for the phase and group velocity of light in plasma, and the effects of the ponderomotive force on the dielectric function. This formalism is useful when the dielectric function of the plasma is almost constant in the frame of the light wave. This is the case for Raman forward scattering (RFS), envelope self-modulation (SM), relativistic self-focusing (SF), and relativistic self-phase modulation (SPM). In the past, the growth rates for RFS and SPM have been derived in terms of wave-wave interactions. Here we rederive all of the aforementioned processes in terms of longitudinal bunching, transverse focusing, and photon acceleration. As a result, the physical mechanisms behind each are made clear and the relationship between RFS and envelope SM is made explicitly clear. This allows a single differential equation to be obtained which couples RFS and SM, so that the relative importance between each process can now be predicted for given experimental conditions.},

abstract = {Ionization-induced injection mechanism was introduced in 2010 to reduce the laser intensity threshold for controllable electron trapping in laser wakefield accelerators (LWFA). However, usually it generates electron beams with continuous energy spectra. Subsequently, a dual-stage target separating the injection and acceleration processes was regarded as essential to achieve narrow energy-spread electron beams by ionization injection. Recently, we numerically proposed a self-truncation scenario of the ionization injection process based upon overshooting of the laser-focusing in plasma which can reduce the electron injection length down to a few hundred micrometers, leading to accelerated beams with extremely low energy-spread in a single-stage. Here, using 100 TW-class laser pulses we report experimental observations of this injection scenario in centimeter-long plasma leading to the generation of narrow energy-spread GeV electron beams, demonstrating its robustness and scalability. Compared with the self-injection and dual-stage schemes, the self-truncated ionization injection generates higher-quality electron beams at lower intensities and densities, and is therefore promising for practical applications.},

One of the techniques used to improve the beam quality is the density transition injection, where the electron trapping occurs as the laser pulse passes a sharp density transition created in the plasma. Although this technique has been widely demonstrated experimentally, the literature lacks theoretical and numerical studies on the effects of all the transition parameters. We thus report and discuss the results of a series of particle in cell (PIC) simulations where the density transition height and downramp length are systematically varied, to show how the electron beam parameters and the injection mechanism are affected by the density transition parameters.},

Based on scaling of laser wakefield acceleration in the quasi-linear regime with the normalized vector potential a 0  = 1.4(1.6), acceleration to 100 (130) GeV requires a 30-m-long plasma waveguide operated at the plasma density n e  ≈ 7×10 15  cm -3  with a channel depth $\Delta$n/n e  = 20\%, while a nonlinear laser wakefield accelerator in the bubble regime with a 0 ≥2 can reach 100 GeV approximately in a 36/a 0 -m-long plasma through self-guiding. The third option is a hybrid concept that employs a ponderomotive channel created by a long leading pulse for guiding a short trailing driving laser pulse. The detail parameters for three options are evaluated, optimizing the operating plasma density at which a given energy gain is obtained over the dephasing length and the matched conditions for propagation of relativistic laser pulses in plasma channels, including the self-guiding. For the production of high-quality beams with 1\%-level energy spread and a 1$\pi$-mm-mradlevel transverse normalized emittance at 100-MeV energy, a simple scheme based on the ionization-induced injection mechanism may be conceived. We investigate electron beam dynamics and effects of synchrotron radiation due to betatron motion by solving the beam dynamics equations on energy and beam radius numerically. For the bubble regime case with a 0  = 4, radiative energy loss becomes 10\% at the maximum energy of 90 GeV. {\textcopyright} 2013 Chinese Optics Letters.},

This phenomenon is generally referred to as 'above-threshold ionization' (ATI). The original experiments investigating ATI used relatively long laser pulses, with the result that amplitudes, energy widths and angular distributions of the individual photoelectron peaks depended on the laser intensity. In addition, the widths of the peaks, as well as their absolute energy positions, changed according to the temporal width of the laser pulse. These dependencies were not intrinsic to the ionization process, but rather were all eventually ascribed to ponderomotive forces exerted on free photoelectrons by the laser focus. The ponderomotive effects frustrated comparisons between theoretical calculations and experimental data. {\textcopyright} 1991 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Simulations showed that the super-Gaussian near-field laser profile that is typical of high-power femtosecond laser systems reduces the efficacy of guiding in parabolic plasma channels compared with the Gaussian laser pulses that are typically simulated.

Mitigation of capillary damage and more accurate alignment allowed for stable beams to be produced with energy 2.7±0.1 GeV.

abstract = {We use three-dimensional (3D) simulations with the particle-in-cell (PIC) code OSIRIS to demonstrate the theoretical production of high-quality electron bunches in beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) by means of field-induced ionization injection. In these simulations, two realistic scenarios for PWFA have been considered: the FLASHForward project at DESY and the FACET experiment at SLAC. These two examples illustrate two different strategies for injection. The first one uses the transverse electric fields of the beam to induce injection, and the second constitutes a new method which utilizes only the wakefields to enable ionization and trapping of high quality electron bunches into beam driven plasma wakes. The produced bunches feature multi-kA peak currents, $\sim$1$\mu$m transverse normalized emittances, uncorrelated energy spreads of ≤1\% on a GeV-energy scale, and few femtosecond bunch lengths. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, the average contrast of the speckle pattern is studied as a function of the radial position in the output end plane for three kinds of misalignment of the incident beam, i.e. defocusing, axial misalignment and angular misalignment. It is found that a variation of the speckle contrast is very sensitive to all kinds of misalignment of the incident beam and that its varying form strongly depends on the kind of misalignment of the incident beam. The speckle contrast at the centre of the output end plane is also examined as a function of the magnitude of misalignment. It is found that the contrast increases from a minimum value in the correct alignment to a certain saturated value with an increase of misalignment. {\textcopyright} 1984 Chapman and Hall Ltd.},

The theoretical foundation of these beams is described and then various experiments that make use of Bessel beams are discussed: these cover a wide range of fields including non-linear optics, where the intense central core of the Bessel beam has attracted interest; short pulse non-diffracting fields; atom optics, where the narrow non-diffracting features of the Bessel beam are able to act as atomic guides and atomic confinement devices and optical manipulation, where the reconstruction properties of the beam enable new effects to be observed that cannot be seen with Gaussian beams. The intensity profile of the Bessel beam may offer routes to investigating statistical physics as well as new techniques for the optical sorting of particles.},

The introduction of an additional laser for heating of the plasma leads to deeper and narrower plasma channels. Here we investigate the formation of laser-heated axially uniform plasma channels.

abstract = {The extraordinary ability of space-charge waves in plasmas to accelerate charged particles at gradients that are orders of magnitude greater than in current accelerators has been well documented. We develop a phenomenological framework for laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the 3D nonlinear regime, in which the plasma electrons are expelled by the radiation pressure of a short pulse laser, leading to nearly complete blowout. Our theory provides a recipe for designing a LWFA for given laser and plasma parameters and estimates the number and the energy of the accelerated electrons whether self-injected or externally injected. These formulas apply for self-guided as well as externally guided pulses (e.g. by plasma channels). We demonstrate our results by presenting a sample particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of a 30 fs, 200TW laser interacting with a 0.75cm long plasma with density 1.5×1018cm-3 to produce an ultrashort (10fs) monoenergetic bunch of self-injected electrons at 1.5GeV with 0.3nC of charge. For future higher-energy accelerator applications, we propose a parameter space, which is distinct from that described by Gordienko and Pukhov in that it involves lower plasma densities and wider spot sizes while keeping the intensity relatively constant. We find that this helps increase the output electron beam energy while keeping the efficiency high. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

The laser pulse (∼150 TW, ∼ 15 J) is quasi-matched into a plasma channel (n p = 1.5×10 17 cm −3 , L∼ 30 cm) and the bi-Gaussian electron beam is externally injected into the wakefield. The beam emittance is preserved through the acceleration by matching the beam size to the transverse focusing fields. And a final energy spread of <1\% has been achieved by optimizing the beam loading effect. Several methods have been proposed to reduce the slice energy spread and are found to be effective.

Here, we use machine learning techniques to automate a 100 MeV-scale accelerator, which optimized its outputs by simultaneously varying up to six parameters including the spectral and spatial phase of the laser and the plasma density and length. Most notably, the model built by the algorithm enabled optimization of the laser evolution that might otherwise have been missed in single-variable scans. Subtle tuning of the laser pulse shape caused an 80\% increase in electron beam charge, despite the pulse length changing by just 1\%.},

The phase of the radar echoes may only be measured modulo 2$\pi$; however, the whole phase at each point in the image is needed to obtain elevations. We present here our approach to “unwrapping” the 2$\pi$ ambiguities in the two‐dimensional data set. We find that noise and geometrical radar layover corrupt our measurements locally, and these local errors can propagate to form global phase errors that affect the entire image. We show that the local errors, or residues, can be readily identified and avoided in the global phase estimation. We present a rectified digital topographic map derived from our unwrapped phase values. Copyright 1988 by the American Geophysical Union.},

A significantly higher electron beam charge was also observed for circular polarization compared to linear polarization over a wide range of parameters. Theoretical analysis and quasi-3D particle-in-cell simulations reveal that the self-injection and hence the laser wakefield acceleration is polarization dependent and indicate a different injection mechanism for circularly polarized laser pulses, originating from larger momentum gain by electrons during above threshold ionization. This enables electrons to meet the trapping condition more easily, and the resulting higher plasma temperature was confirmed via spectroscopy of the XUV plasma emission.},

abstract = { Photographs by J. E. Mack of the first atomic explosion in New Mexico were measured, and the radius, R , of the luminous globe or ‘ball of fire' which spread out from the centre was determined for a large range of values of t , the time measured from the start of the explosion. The relationship predicted in part I, namely, that R* would be proportional to t , is surprisingly accurately verified over a range from R = 20 to 185 m. The value of R" t-1 so found was used in conjunction with the formulae of part I to estimate the energy E which was generated in the explosion. The amount of this estimate depends on what value is assumed for y , the ratio of the specific heats of air. Two estimates are given in terms of the number of tons of the chemical explosive T.N.T. which would release the same energy. The first is probably the more accurate and is 16,800 tons. The second, which is 23,700 tons, probably overestimates the energy, but is included to show the amount of error which might be expected if the effect of radiation were neglected and that of high temperature on the specific heat of air were taken into account. Reasons are given for believing that these two effects neutralize one another. After the explosion a hemispherical volume of very hot gas is left behind and Mack's photographs were used to measure the velocity of rise of the glowing centre of the heated volume. This velocity was found to be 35 m./sec. Until the hot air suffers turbulent mixing with the surrounding cold air it may be expected to rise like a large bubble in water. The radius of the ‘equivalent bubble' is calculated and found to be 293 m. The vertical velocity of a bubble of this radius is 2/3 √(g 29300) or 35.7 m./sec. The agreement with the measured value, 35 m./sec., is better than the nature of the measurements permits one to expect. },

It uses two colliding laser pulses that propagate transversely to the plasma wave. For colliding pulses with equal frequencies, a beam with very low emittance is generated when the collision is close to the density peak of the plasma wave. Electrons near the axis are accelerated longitudinally by the ponderomotive force of the colliding pulses, accelerated transversely by the beat wave, and subsequently injected into the second bucket of the wake. Ionization is used to increase the transverse injection area and the final trapped charge. Simulations show that the transverse emittance can be less than the 0.1 mm mrad level, which is important for many applications. For colliding laser pulses with different frequencies, the beat wave can produce asymmetric injection, which can enhance betatron radiation generated by the electron beam. {\textcopyright} Published by the American Physical Society.},

This concept is realized by spatially separating spectral components of pulses into a "rainbow beam" and recombining these components only at the spatial focus of the objective lens. Thus, temporal pulse width becomes a function of distance, with the shortest pulse width confined to the spatial focus. We developed analytical expressions to describe this method and experimentally demonstrated the feasibility. The concept of simultaneous spatial and temporal focusing of femtosecond pulses has the great potential to significantly reduce the background excitation in multiphoton microscopy, which fundamentally limits the imaging depth in highly scattering biological specimens.},

abstract = {Laser wakefield electron acceleration in the blow-out regime and the associated betatron X-ray radiation were investigated experimentally as a function of the plasma density in a configuration where the laser is guided. Dielectric capillary tubes were employed to assist the laser keeping self-focused over a long distance by collecting the laser energy around its central focal spot. With a 40 fs, 16 TW pulsed laser, electron bunches with tens of pC charge were measured to be accelerated to an energy up to 300 MeV, accompanied by X-ray emission with a peak brightness of the order of 1021 ph/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1\%BW. Electron trapping and acceleration were studied using the emitted X-ray beam distribution to map the acceleration process; the number of betatron oscillations performed by the electrons was inferred from the correlation between measured X-ray fluence and beam charge. A study of the stability of electron and X-ray generation suggests that the fluctuation of X-ray emission can be reduced by stabilizing the beam charge. The experimental results are in good agreement with 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC},

Experiments using a channel guided laser wakefield accelerator at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) have demonstrated that near mono-energetic 100 MeV-class electron beams can be produced with a 10 TW laser system. Analysis, aided by particle-in-cell simulations, as well as experiments with various plasma lengths and densities, indicate that tailoring the length of the accelerator, together with loading of the accelerating structure with beam, is the key to production of mono-energetic electron beams. Increasing the energy towards a GeV and beyond will require reducing the plasma density and design criteria are discussed for an optimized accelerator module. The current progress and future directions are summarized through comparison with conventional accelerators, highlighting the unique short-term prospects for intense radiation sources based on laser-driven plasma accelerators.},

In this paper, we deduce another type of analytic expression suitable for describing the beam profile generated from the axicon illuminated by the Gaussian beam based on the interferential theory. Compared with the Fresnel diffraction integral theory, this theory does not use much approximation in the process of mathematical analysis. According to the derived expression, the beam intensity profiles at any positions behind the axicon can be calculated not just restricted inside the cross region as the Fresnel diffraction integral theory gives. The experiments prove that the theoretical results fit the experimental results very well. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The model is based on the quasi-static or frozen field approximation, which reduces a fully three-dimensional electromagnetic field solve and particle push to a two-dimensional field solve and particle push. This is done by calculating the plasma wake assuming that the drive beam and/or laser does not evolve during the time it takes for it to pass a plasma particle. The complete electromagnetic fields of the plasma wake and its associated index of refraction are then used to evolve the drive beam and/or laser using very large time steps. This algorithm reduces the computational time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Comparison between the new algorithm and conventional fully explicit models (OSIRIS) is presented. The agreement is excellent for problems of interest. Direction for future work is also presented. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

To date, most of these experiments are performed using an electron or a high-energy photon beam that is synchronized to an infrared laser pulse. Entirely new opportunities can be explored if not only a single, but multiple synchronized, ultrashort, high-energy beams are used. However, this requires advanced radiation sources that are capable of producing dual-energy electron beams, for example. Here, we demonstrate simultaneous generation of twin-electron beams from a single compact laser wakefield accelerator. The energy of each beam can be individually adjusted over a wide range and our analysis shows that the bunch lengths and their delay inherently amount to femtoseconds. Our proof-of-concept results demonstrate an elegant way to perform multi-beam experiments in the future on a laboratory scale.},

The tail of the pulse, confined in the accelerator cavity (an electron density 'bubble'), experiences periodic focusing, while the head, which is the most intense portion of the pulse, steadily self-guides. Oscillations of the cavity size cause periodic injection of electrons from the ambient plasma, creating an electron energy comb with the number of components, their mean energy, and energy spacing dependent on the channel radius and pulse length. These customizable electron beams enable the design of a tunable, all-optical source of pulsed, polychromatic $\gamma$-rays using the mechanism of inverse Thomson scattering, with up to ∼10-5 conversion efficiency from the drive pulse in the electron accelerator to the $\gamma$-ray beam. Such a source may radiate ∼107 quasi-monochromatic photons per shot into a microsteradian-scale cone. The photon energy is distributed among several distinct bands, each having sub-30\% energy spread, with a highest energy of 12.5 MeV.},

In this work improved control of electron self-injection in the nonlinear cavity regime using two laser-pulses propagating in tandem is investigated. In particular the advantages of the tandem-pulse scheme in terms of injection threshold, electron energy and beam properties in a regime relevant to betatron radiation are demonstrated. Moreover it is shown that the laser power threshold for electron self-injection can be reduced by up to a factor of two compared to the standard, single-pulse wakefield scheme.},

abstract = {Electron acceleration by laser-driven plasma waves is capableof producing ultra-relativistic, quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches with orders of magnitude higher accelerating gradients and much shorter electron pulses than state-of-the-art radio-frequency accelerators. Recent developments have shown peak energies reaching into the GeV range and improved stability and control over the energy spectrum and charge. Future applications, such as the development of laboratory X-ray sources with unprecedented peak brilliance or ultrafast time-resolved measurements critically rely on a temporal characterization of the acceleration process and the electron bunch. Here, we report the first real-time observation of the accelerated electron pulse and the accelerating plasma wave. Our time-resolved study allows a single-shot measurement of the 5.8−2.1+1.9 fs electron bunch full-width at half-maximum (2.5−0.9+0.8 fs root mean square) as well as the plasma wave with a density-dependent period of 12–22 fs and reveals the evolution of the bunch, its position in the surrounding plasma wave and the wake dynamics. The results afford promise for brilliant, sub-{\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}m-wavelength ultrafast electron and photon sources for diffraction imaging with atomic resolution in space and time.},

The aB-modes are described by the nth-order Bessel function of the first kind with complex argument. The asymmetry degree of the nonparaxial aB-mode is shown to depend on a real parameter c{&}{#}x2265;0: when c=0, the aB-mode is identical to a conventional radially symmetric Bessel mode; with increasing c, the aB-mode starts to acquire a crescent form, getting stretched along the vertical axis and shifted along the horizontal axis for c{&}{#}x226B;1. On the horizontal axis, the aB-modes have a denumerable number of isolated intensity zeros that generate optical vortices with a unit topological charge of opposite sign on opposite sides of 0. At different values of the parameter c, the intensity zeros change their location on the horizontal axis, thus changing the beam{&}{#}x2019;s OAM. An isolated intensity zero on the optical axis generates an optical vortex with topological charge n. The OAM per photon of an aB-mode depends near-linearly on c, being equal to {&}{#}x210F;(n+cI1(2c)/I0(2c)), where {&}{#}x210F; is the Planck constant and In(x) is a modified Bessel function. },

Yet, because of a long injection length, this injection technique leads generally to the production of large energy spread electron beams.

Experimental results show that the energy spread can be reduced down to 10 MeV and that the beam energy can be tuned by varying the position of the shock. This simple technique leads to very stable and reliable injection even for modest laser energy. It should therefore become a unique tool for the development of laser-plasma accelerators.},

Second order nonlinear differential equations of the beam width parameter have been derived for the propagation of the laser through uniform homogenous plasma and preformed plasma channel having parabolic density profile. Differential equations of beam width parameter have been solved numerically using Runge Kutta method. It has been observed from analysis that when the laser pulse propagates through the homogenous plasma, the low intensity front and rear parts of the laser get defocused/diffracted and the high intensity central/main portion of the laser pulse gets self-guided. As a result of this, the laser pulse gets distorted. This distortion of the laser has not been observed when the laser pulse is propagated through the plasma channel having density minimum at the axis and maximum at the edges. The laser pulse is guided as a whole, even the low intensity front and rear parts of the laser are also guided. Therefore, the plasma channel is useful to prevent the distortion/breakup of the laser.},

In addition to this there is a pull towards development of industrial and multi-disciplinary applications, which demands much higher repetition rates, delivering high-average powers with higher efficiencies and the use of alternative wavelengths: mid-IR facilities.

abstract = {Plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA) is a novel acceleration technique with promising prospects for both particle colliders and light sources. However, PWFA research has so far been limited to a few large-scale accelerator facilities worldwide. Here, we present first results on plasma wakefield generation using electron beams accelerated with a 100-TW-class Ti:sapphire laser. Because of their ultrashort duration and high charge density, the laser-accelerated electron bunches are suitable to drive plasma waves at electron densities in the order of 1019 cm-3. We capture the beam-induced plasma dynamics with femtosecond resolution using few-cycle optical probing and, in addition to the plasma wave itself, we observe a distinctive transverse ion motion in its trail. This previously unobserved phenomenon can be explained by the ponderomotive force of the plasma wave acting on the ions, resulting in a modulation of the plasma density over many picoseconds. Because of the scaling laws of plasma wakefield generation, results obtained at high plasma density using high-current laser-accelerated electron beams can be readily scaled to low-density systems. Laser-driven PWFA experiments can thus act as miniature models for their larger, conventional counterparts. Furthermore, our results pave the way towards a novel generation of laser-driven PWFA, which can potentially provide ultralow emittance beams within a compact setup.},

We investigate beam dynamics and synchrotron radiation due to the betatron oscillation of the beam in laser-plasma acceleration, characterizing the beam qualities such as energy spread and transverse emittance. According to the criteria on the beam qualities for applications and available laser sources, the operating plasma density will be optimized.

Hollow plasma channels have been proposed as a technique for generating accelerating fields without transverse forces. Here we demonstrate a method for creating an extended hollow plasma channel and measure the wakefields created by an ultrarelativistic positron beam as it propagates through the channel. The plasma channel is created by directing a high-intensity laser pulse with a spatially modulated profile into lithium vapour, which results in an annular region of ionization.

abstract = {The ionization-induced injection in laser wakefield acceleration has been recently demonstrated to be a promising injection scheme. However, the energy spread controlling in this mechanism remains a challenge because continuous injection in a mixed gas target is usually inevitable. Here we propose that by use of certain initially unmatched laser pulses, the electron injection can be constrained to the very front region of the mixed gas target, typically in a length of a few hundreds micro meters determined by laser-driven bubble deformation. Under some optimized conditions, the injection region is well limited within $200\rm \mu m$ and the electron beam with central energy of 383 MeV, energy spread of 3.33\% in FWHM, normalized emittance of 3.12 mm mrad and charge of 14.58 pC can be obtained according to particle-in-cell simulations. Both multi-dimensional simulations and theoretical analysis illustrate the effectiveness of this scheme.},

abstract = {Excitation of accelerating modes in transversely inhomogeneous plasma channels is considered as an initial value problem. Discrete eigenmodes are supported by plasma channels with sharp density gradients. These eigenmodes are collisionlessly damped as the gradients are smoothed. Using collisionless Landau damping as the analogy, the existence and damping of these "quasi-modes" is studied by constructing and analytically continuing the causal Green's function of wake excitation into the lower half of the complex frequency plane. Electromagnetic nature of the plasma wakes in the channel makes their excitation nonlocal. This results in the algebraic decay of the fields with time due to phase-mixing of plasma oscillations with spatially-varying frequencies. Characteristic decay rate is given by the mixing time $\tau$m, which corresponds to the dephasing of two plasma fluid elements separated by the collisionless skin depth. For wide channels analytic expressions for the field evolution are derived. Implications for electron acceleration in plasma channels are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In the present paper, laser pulse distortion/breakup and the effect of the plasma channel on the laser propagation through the collisional plasma have been studied by using moment theory approach. Second order nonlinear differential equations of the beam width parameter have been derived for the propagation of the laser through uniform homogenous plasma and preformed plasma channel having parabolic density profile. Differential equations of beam width parameter have been solved numerically using Runge Kutta method. It has been observed from analysis that when the laser pulse propagates through the homogenous plasma, the low intensity front and rear parts of the laser get defocused/diffracted and the high intensity central/main portion of the laser pulse gets self-guided. As a result of this, the laser pulse gets distorted. This distortion of the laser has not been observed when the laser pulse is propagated through the plasma channel having density minimum at the axis and maximum at the edges. The laser pulse is guided as a whole, even the low intensity front and rear parts of the laser are also guided. Therefore, the plasma channel is useful to prevent the distortion/breakup of the laser.},

Aside from being compact, seeded plasma-based soft X-ray lasers (SXRLs) turn out to be enticing as photon-rich sources (up to 10 15 per pulse) that display high-quality optical properties. Hitherto, the duration of these sources was limited to the picosecond range, which consequently restricts the field of applications. This bottleneck was overcome by gating the gain through ultrafast collisional ionization in a high-density plasma generated by an ultraintense infrared pulse (a few 10 18 €...W cm '2) guided in an optically pre-formed plasma waveguide. For electron densities that ranged from 3 × 10 18 €...cm '3 to 1.2 × 10 20 €...cm '3, the gain duration was measured to drop from 7€...ps to an unprecedented value of about 450€...fs, which paves the way to compact and ultrafast SXRL beams with performances previously only accessible in large-scale facilities.},

abstract = {Physics considerations for a next-generation linear collider based on laser-plasma accelerators are discussed. The ultrahigh accelerating gradient of a laser-plasma accelerator and short laser coupling distance between accelerator stages allows for a compact linac. Two regimes of laser-plasma acceleration are discussed. The highly nonlinear regime has the advantages of higher accelerating fields and uniform focusing forces, whereas the quasilinear regime has the advantage of symmetric accelerating properties for electrons and positrons. Scaling of various accelerator and collider parameters with respect to plasma density and laser wavelength are derived. Reduction of beamstrahlung effects implies the use of ultrashort bunches of moderate charge. The total linac length scales inversely with the square root of the plasma density, whereas the total power scales proportional to the square root of the density. A 1 TeV center-of-mass collider based on stages using a plasma density of 1017  cm-3 requires tens of J of laser energy per stage (using 1  $\mu$m wavelength lasers) with tens of kHz repetition rate. Coulomb scattering and synchrotron radiation are examined and found not to significantly degrade beam quality. A photon collider based on laser-plasma accelerated beams is also considered. The requirements for the scattering laser energy are comparable to those of a single laser-plasma accelerator stage.},

Measurement techniques providing the complete $E$-field of ultrashort laser beams in both time and space are now being developed. Yet, they had so far not been applied to the most powerful ultrashort lasers, which reach the PetaWatt range by pushing the Chirped Pulse Amplification scheme to its present technical limits. This situation left doubts on their actual performance, and in particular on the peak intensity they can reach at focus. In this article we present the first complete spatio-temporal characterization of a PetaWatt femtosecond laser operating at full intensity, the BELLA laser, using two recently-developed independent measurement techniques. Our results demonstrate that, with adequate optimization, the CPA technique is still suitable at these extreme scales, i.e., it is not inherently limited by spatio-temporal couplings. We also show how these measurements provide unprecedented insight into the physics and operation regime of such laser systems.},

abstract = {A one-dimensional, quasistatic model of a capillary discharge plasma has been developed. Such a plasma is useful as a medium to generate plasma waves for acceleration of electrons via processes such as laser wakefield acceleration or plasma wakefield acceleration. Another important characteristic of the plasma is its intrinsic parabolic density distribution near the center of the capillary, which can channel a laser beam along the capillary. The model is intended to be a design tool to aid in the selection of the capillary parameters in order to obtain desired plasma characteristics, e.g., plasma density and matched laser beam radius for guiding. An optional external axial magnetic field can be included, which improves the laser-channeling effect in some cases. The model also enables a measure of the potential for laser damage of the capillary wall. Results are presented for the design of a gas-filled capillary that will be tested during the staged electron laser acceleration-laser wakefield (STELLA-LW) experiment. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

Spectral redshifting of the laser light is studied as an indicator of the efficiency of laser energy transfer into the plasma through the generation of coherent plasma wakefields. Influences of input laser energy, plasma density, temporal and spatial laser profiles, and laser focal location in a plasma channel are analyzed. Energy transfer is found to be sensitive to details of laser pulse shape and focal location. The experimental conditions for these critical parameters are modeled and included in particle-in-cell simulations. Simulations reproduce the redshift of the laser within uncertainties of the experiments and produce an estimate of the wake amplitudes in the experiments as a function of amount of redshift.

abstract = {Ionization injection in a laser-plasma accelerator is studied analytically and by multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. To enable the production of low energy spread beams, we consider a short region containing a high atomic number gas (e.g., nitrogen) for ionization-induced trapping, followed by a longer region using a low atomic number gas (e.g., hydrogen), that is, free of additional trapping, for post acceleration. For a broad laser pulse, ionization injection requires a minimum normalized laser field of a 0 ≃ 1. 7, assuming a resonant Gaussian laser pulse. Effects of gas mix parameters, including species, concentration, and length of the mixture region, on the final electron injection number and beam quality are studied. The minimum energy spread is determined by the spread in initial ionized phases of the electrons in the wakefield due to the tunneling ionization process within the laser pulse. Laser polarization and intensity effects on injection number and final electron emittance are examined. Two-dimensional PIC simulations are used to study the ionization injection process and the transverse beam structure. With proper laser-plasma parameters, mono-energetic electron beams with 10 pC charge, a central energy at GeV level, and energy spread less than 1 can be produced in a mixed gas with ionized electron density of 10 18 cm - 3. Lower density can give a higher final accelerated beam energy and reduce the final relative energy spread even further. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

We use both analytical models and numerical simulations using a relativistic particle-in-cell code. The present description is valid for relativistic laser intensities, when the normalized field amplitude is much larger than one, a 1. We also discuss two distinct processes associated with linear and circular polarization. Using both analytical solutions and particle-in-cell simulations, we are able to show that, for laser pulses in a well defined Laguerre-Gauss mode, angular momentum conservation is observed during the process of harmonic generation. Intensity modulation of the harmonic spectrum is also verified, as imposed by the nonlinear time-scale for energy transfer between different harmonics.},

abstract = {The problem of measuring broad-band femtosecond pulses by the technique of second-harmonic generation frequency-resolved optical gating (SHG FROG) is addressed. We derive the full equation for the FROG signal, which is valid even for single-optical-cycle pulses. The effect of the phase mismatch in the second-harmonic crystal, the implications of the beam geometry, and the frequency-dependent variation of the nonlinearity are discussed in detail. Our numerical simulations show that, under carefully chosen experimental conditions and with a proper spectral correction of the data, the traditional FROG inversion routines work well even in the single-cycle regime. The developed description of the SHG FROG signal was applied to measure the white-light continuum pulses in the spectral region of 500–1100 nm. The obtained spectral phase of these pulses served as a target function for the pulse compressor design. The pulses produced by compression around 800 nm were also characterized by SHG FROG. The resulting pulse duration measures 4.5 fs which corresponds to 2.5 optical cycles.},

In the large wave amplitude limit, the maximum energy of a trapped electron scales as 2 $\gamma$p2Ez2, where $\gamma$p is the relativistic factor associated with plasma wave phase velocity and Ez is the electric field amplitude of the nonlinear plasma wave. This is in contrast to the well-known results for a sinusoidal wave, in which the maximum energy scales as 4 $\gamma$p2Ez. As the nonlinear plasma wave approaches wavebreaking, the maximum energy is given by $\gamma$max→4$\gamma$ p3-3$\gamma$p, where $\gamma$max is the relativistic factor of the trapped electron. {\textcopyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The Abel transform and its inverse appear in a wide variety of problems in which it is necessary to reconstruct axisymetric functions from line-integral projections. We present a new family of algorithms, principally for Abel inversion, that are recursive and hence computationally efficient. The methods are based on a linear, space-variant, state-variable model of the Abel transform. The model is the basis for deterministic algorithms, applicable when data are noise free, and least-squares-estimation (Kalman filter) algorithms, which accommodate the noisy data case. Both one-pass (filtering) and two-pass (smoothing) estimators are considered. In computer simulations,the new algorithms compare favorably with previous methods for Abel inversion.},

Despite this need, the acceleration of largely charged beams has been barely studied. Here we explore both experimentally and numerically the physics of highly loaded wakefield acceleration. We find that the shape of the electron spectra is strikingly independent of the laser energy, due to the emergence of a saturation effect induced by beamloading. A transition from quasi-Maxwellian spectra at high plasma densities to flatter spectra at lower densities is also found, which is shown to be produced by the wakefield driven by the electron bunch itself after the laser depletion.},

abstract = {The injection of quasimonoenergetic electron beams into a laser wakefield accelerator is demonstrated experimentally using density gradients at the edges of a plasma channel. In the experiment, two laser pulses are used; the main laser pulse drives a wakefield, while a second countercrossing laser beam produces a plasma whose expansion creates a channel with significant density gradients. Local injection of electrons in the wakefield is triggered by wave breaking in the density ramp. The injection is localized spatially and leads to the generation of collimated and narrow energy spread relativistic electron beams at the 100 MeV level, with charges in the range of 20-100 pC. The stability of this injection process is compared to the stability of the colliding pulse injection process and is found to be inferior for our experimental conditions. On the other hand, it is found that as the electron beam divergence is smaller in the case of gradient injection, the transverse emittance might be better. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

Small radius waveguides with central densities as low as similar to 10(18) cm(-3) can be generated with this technique. Despite the expected subpicosecond cluster disassembly time, we observe long pulse absorption efficiencies that can be more than a factor of 10 greater than in unclustered gas targets of the same volume average atomic density. The maximum long pulse absorption observed in cluster jets under our range of conditions was 35\%. The explanation for the enhanced absorption is that in the far-leading edge of the laser pulse, the volume of heated clusters evolves to a locally uniform and cool plasma already near ionization saturation, which is then heated by the remainder of the pulse. From this perspective, the use of clustered gases is equivalent to a supercharged preionization scheme for long duration laser pulses.},

abstract = {Very high energy electrons (VHEE) in the range from 100 to 250 MeV have the potential of becoming an alternative modality in radiotherapy because of their improved dosimetric properties compared with 6–20 MV photons generated by clinical linear accelerators (LINACs). VHEE beams have characteristics unlike any other beams currently used for radiotherapy: femtosecond to picosecond duration electron bunches, which leads to very high dose per pulse, and energies that exceed that currently used in clinical applications. Dosimetry with conventional online detectors, such as ionization chambers or diodes, is a challenge due to non-negligible ion recombination effects taking place in the sensitive volumes of these detectors. FLUKA and Geant4 Monte Carlo (MC) codes have been employed to study the temporal and spectral evolution of ultrashort VHEE beams in a water phantom. These results are complemented by ion recombination measurements employing an IBA CC04 ionization chamber for a 165 MeV VHEE beam. For comparison, ion recombination has also been measured using the same chamber with a conventional 20 MeV electron beam. This work demonstrates that the IBA CC04 ionization chamber exhibits significant ion recombination and is therefore not suitable for dosimetry of ultrashort pulsed VHEE beams applying conventional correction factors. Further study is required to investigate the applicability of ion chambers in VHEE dosimetry.},

abstract = {Single-shot, charge-dependent emittance measurements of electron beams generated by a laser plasma accelerator (LPA) reveal that shock-induced density down-ramp injection produces beams with normalized emittances a factor of 2 smaller than beams produced via ionization injection. Such a comparison is made possible by the tunable LPA setup, which allows electron beams with nearly identical central energy and peak spectral charge density to be produced using the two distinct injection mechanisms. Parametric measurements of this type are essential for the development of LPA-based applications which ultimately require high charge density and low emittance. Owing to their ability to accelerate electron beams to GeV-class energies over centimeter-scale distances with femtosecond-scale bunch durations and ultralow emittan-ces [1], laser plasma accelerators (LPAs) are poised to usher in a new era of compact accelerator driven applications. Compact LPA-based x-ray free-electron lasers [2–5], com-pact monoenergetic MeV-class Thomson-scattered photons [6,7], and progress towards an LPA-based electron-positron collider [8] are being actively pursued. Most LPA-based applications require excellent 6D electron beam brightness, defined as B 6D ¼ I b =ð$\sigma$ E ϵ x ϵ y Þ, where I b is the peak beam current, $\sigma$ E is the energy spread, and ϵ x;y are the normalized transverse emittances (herein referred to simply as emit-tance). Although a key critical parameter, to date very few direct emittance measurements have been carried out, perhaps owing to the typical percent-level energy spreads and challenges of LPA stability and tunability. Besides indirect techniques based on spectral analysis of x-ray betatron or Compton radiation [9–11] (which rely on various assumptions, simulations, and complex analysis to unravel the e-beam source properties), traditional knife scans and pepperpot measurements are limited in their utility [12]. Only Weingartner et al. [13] performed direct post-LPA emittance characterization by combining conven-tional quadrupole focusing techniques and the energy-dispersed plane of a magnetic spectrometer (a technique also recently applied in electron-beam-driven plasma wake-field acceleration experiments [14]). While impressively demonstrating ϵ ≃ 0.21 mm mrad, little was done to explore parametric dependences of the emittance. In this Letter we combine a stable and tunable LPA, followed by a quadrupole triplet and an energy-dispersed magnetic spectrometer, all in a resolution-optimized geom-etry to perform parametric studies on the LPA emittance. We present a direct comparison of emittance measurements of electron beams generated by two different injection mech-anisms: ionization injection [15–19] and shock-induced density down-ramp injection [20–25]. Both schemes have attracted recognition as a path towards localized and controllable injection, and direct energy-dispersed emit-tance measurements have so far not been measured. In the former case, a high intensity laser a > 2 ionizes and drives a wake in a high-Z-doped gas, with a the normalized laser strength [1]. The inner-shell electrons that eventually get trapped are only ionized near the peak of the laser at time t i and will experience a transverse ponderomotive kick that will contribute to increased emittance. In addition, in the polarization plane, a residual transverse momentum p ⊥ =m e c ≈ aðt i Þ will contribute as well. In the density down-ramp injection scheme, a wake driven in a preformed plasma crosses a transition from high to low density plasma. At this crossing, a decrease in the local phase velocity of the wake relaxes the threshold for trapping electrons. Density down-ramp injection in the nonlinear bubble regime is considerably complex due in large part to the plasma density spike at the point of injection near the back of the bubble. From simulations it is clear, however, that in contrast to ionization injection, the trapped electrons originate from a much more selective area in the background electron's phase space (and thus obtain a lower emittance). The two configurations of the LPA were tuned and optimized to deliver beams with the same central energy and peak spectral charge density (charge/MeV), thus enabling evaluation of one injection method versus the other. The down-ramp method yielded ϵ ¼ 1 mm mrad at application-relevant charge densities up to 2 pC=MeV, and doubled for the ionization-injected beam. In both schemes a clear relation between charge density and emittance was recorded. These results mark a major step forward in characterizing and comparing LPA sources produced by different injection mechanisms. The LPA community's variety in injection mechanisms, plasma targets, and laser parameters offers the opportunity for further source opti-mization to enable exciting applications.},

abstract = {Bare, cylindrical, explosive charges produce secondary shock waves in the direction of least presented area. Whilst the source of these shock waves was explored in the 1940's, no attempt was made to predict them. This paper describes the detonation of bare, cylindrical charges of PE4 (RDX binder 88/12\%), mass 0.2 to 0.46{\^{a}}.kg and with a length to diameter ratio of 4 to 1. High speed camera footage showed (i) the formation of the separate, primary, shock waves from the sides and ends of the charge, (ii) Mach reflection of these separate shock waves, giving rise to reflected, secondary shock waves, and (iii) the secondary shock waves catching and merging with the primary shock wave. In the axial direction, the secondary shock wave's peak overpressure and impulse exceeded that of the primary shock wave for scaled distances, Z=R/M1/3 ≥3.9 m kg-1/3, where M is the mass in kg and R the distance from the charge in m. It was found possible to predict the primary peak overpressure, P, at all distances in the axial direction, for a constant length to diameter ratio, using P=3075 Z-3-1732 Z-2+305 Z-1. Close in the primary peak overpressure is proportional to M/R3 in the axial direction. It was not possible to predict the secondary peak overpressure with the data obtained. The total impulse from both shock waves, I, in the axial direction can be predicted using I=746(M2/3/R)3-708(M2/3/R)2+306(M2/3/R).},

abstract = {Capillary channels of ≈3cm in length and with plasma densities ≈1018cm-3 are a promising alternative to the much shorter, higher-density gas jets for GeV-scale laser wakefield acceleration of electrons. However, the large discrepancy between length scales of the plasma and the laser presents a major computational challenge for particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Methods are therefore sought that relax the need to concurrently resolve both length scales. For example, the commonly used "moving window" algorithm enables a reduction of the computational domain to a few plasma wavelengths, which is orders of magnitude smaller than the full length of the laser-plasma interaction. In addition, ponderomotive guiding center methods enable relaxation of the constraint to resolve the laser wavelength. These averaging methods split the laser-induced current into a rapidly varying part and a slowly varying envelope. The average over fast time scales is performed in a semianalytic way, leaving the evolution of the laser envelope and the plasma response to be modeled numerically. Here, we present a ponderomotive guiding center algorithm and demonstrate its applicability to model capillary channels by comparing it with fully kinetic PIC simulations. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

It is found that an intense laser pulse can be steadily self-guided in underdense plasmas with nearly a constant spot size if the self-consistently generated electron cavity has a sufficiently steep density gradient at the edge. In a preformed plasma channel, however, laser guiding is maintained mainly by the balance between the light diffraction and focusing. The latter is induced by the wall plasmas which greatly reduce the local dielectric constant. It is shown that the self-guiding of a laser pulse in uniform plasmas requires tens of terawatts power, but those that are in preformed channels can be realized with only a terawatt power. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

A laser pulse propagating perpendicularly to the axis of the capillary and focused onto a copper wire creates a plasma that initiates the discharge. This transverse laser ignition method has several advantages over previous techniques employing a laser pulse collinear with the capillary, including increased capillary lifetime and simpler arrangement of the igniting and the driving pulses for laser-wakefield acceleration. Using this technique long, low density plasma channels are produced with low jitter. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The complete characterization of an ultrashort laser beam ultimately requires the determination of its spatio-temporal electric field E(x, y, t), or its spatio-spectral counterpart &#x01EBC;(x, y, &#x003C9;). We describe a new measurement technique called INSIGHT, which determines &#x01EBC;(x, y, &#x003C9;), up to an unknown spatially-homogeneous spectral phase. Combining this information with a temporal measurement at a single point of the beam then enables the determination of the spatio-temporal field E(x, y, t). This technique is based on the combination of spatially-resolved Fourier-transform spectroscopy with an alternate-projection phase-retrieval algorithm. It can be applied to any reproducible laser source with a repetition rate higher than about 0.1 Hz, relies on a very simple device, does not require any reference beam, and circumvents the difficulty associated with the manipulation of large beam diameters by working in the vicinity of the beam focus. We demonstrate INSIGHT on a 100 TW-25 fs laser, and use the measurement results to introduce new representations for the analysis of spatio-temporal/spectral couplings of ultrashort lasers.},

When interacting with a high-energy electron beam, today's lasers are sufficiently intense to explore the transition between the classical and quantum radiation reaction regimes. We report on the observation of radiation reaction in the collision of an ultra-relativistic electron beam generated by laser wakefield acceleration ($\varepsilon > 500$ MeV) with an intense laser pulse ($a_0 > 10$). We measure an energy loss in the post-collision electron spectrum that is correlated with the detected signal of hard photons ($\gamma$-rays), consistent with a quantum (stochastic) description of radiation reaction. The generated $\gamma$-rays have the highest energies yet reported from an all-optical inverse Compton scattering scheme, with critical energy $\varepsilon_{\rm crit} > $ 30 MeV.},

abstract = {The use of a short-pulse petawatt (PW) laser ($\tau$L < 200 fs, wavelength ≈1 $\mu$m) enables experimental realization of a self-guided, multicentimetre-long multi-GeV laser wakefield electron accelerator. A comprehensive set of numerical simulations showed that a 150 fs, 1.33 PW pulse is self-guided over 10 cm of a static filling gaseous plasma of density 1-3 x 1017 cm-3 and is stable against relativistic filamentation. A fully broken electromagnetic wake (electron density 'bubble') is excited over the entire interaction length. Variations of bubble size and shape associated with nonlinear evolution of the driving pulse result in self-injection of background plasma electrons. Selfinjection begins immediately after the first nonlinear laser focus, where pulse de-focusing forces the bubble to grow. Injection continues without interruption while the bubble expands, and ceases when the laser becomes self-guided and bubble evolution stabilizes. Self-injected electrons are accelerated to ∼7 GeV with less than 10\% energy spread and ∼1.3 nC charge. Numerical modelling of the laser pulse dynamics over the entire plasma length is carried out using a timeaveraged, fully relativistic, quasi-static three-dimensional (3D) axi-symmetric particle-in-cell (PIC) code, WAKE. The process of electron self-injection is explored by means of both test-particle modelling (WAKE) and 3D PIC simulations using the recently developed CALDER-Circ code in quasi-cylindrical geometry. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

Intense (<5×1017 W/cm2), short (75 fs) laser pulses have been injected and guided in channels produced using a novel ignitor-heater technique, which uses two laser pulses. The ignitor, an ultrashort (<100 fs) laser pulse, is brought to a line focus to ionize the gas jet. The heater pulse (160 ps long) is subsequently used to heat the existing spark via inverse Bremsstrahlung. The hydrodynamic shock expansion creates a channel. This technique allows the creation of slab or cylindrical channels in low atomic number gases, e.g., hydrogen. The channel profile was diagnosed with time resolved longitudinal interferometry. The effects of laser beam size and divergence mismatch at the channel entrance and leakage of the laser energy out of the channel are studied theoretically and experimentally in one and two transverse dimensions. An all-optical channel wake diagnostic based on Fourier domain interferometry is discussed, and a holographic-type inversion technique is proposed to increase the accuracy and reach of this method.},

abstract = { Charged particles accelerated by electromagnetic fields emit radiation, which must, by the conservation of momentum, exert a recoil on the emitting particle. The force of this recoil, known as radiation reaction, strongly affects the dynamics of ultrarelativistic electrons in intense electromagnetic fields. Such environments are found astrophysically, e.g. in neutron star magnetospheres, and will be created in laser–matter experiments in the next generation of high-intensity laser facilities. In many of these scenarios, the energy of an individual photon of the radiation can be comparable to the energy of the emitting particle, which necessitates modelling not only of radiation reaction, but quantum radiation reaction. The worldwide development of multi-petawatt laser systems in large-scale facilities, and the expectation that they will create focussed electromagnetic fields with unprecedented intensities   $$> 10^{23}\,\mathrm {W}\text {cm}^{-2}$$   >  10 23   W  cm  - 2       , has motivated renewed interest in these effects. In this paper I review theoretical and experimental progress towards understanding radiation reaction, and quantum effects on the same, in high-intensity laser fields that are probed with ultrarelativistic electron beams. In particular, we will discuss how analytical and numerical methods give insight into new kinds of radiation–reaction-induced dynamics, as well as how the same physics can be explored in experiments at currently existing laser facilities. },

abstract = {High-efficiency acceleration of charged particle beams at high gradients of energy gain per unit length is necessary to achieve an affordable and compact high-energy collider. The plasma wakefield accelerator is one concept being developed for this purpose. In plasma wakefield acceleration, a charge-density wake with high accelerating fields is driven by the passage of an ultra-relativistic bunch of charged particles (the drive bunch) through a plasma. If a second bunch of relativistic electrons (the trailing bunch) with sufficient charge follows in the wake of the drive bunch at an appropriate distance, it can be efficiently accelerated to high energy. Previous experiments using just a single 42-gigaelectronvolt drive bunch have accelerated electrons with a continuous energy spectrum and a maximum energy of up to 85 gigaelectronvolts from the tail of the same bunch in less than a metre of plasma. However, the total charge of these accelerated electrons was insufficient to extract a substantial amount of energy from the wake. Here we report high-efficiency acceleration of a discrete trailing bunch of electrons that contains sufficient charge to extract a substantial amount of energy from the high-gradient, nonlinear plasma wakefield accelerator. Specifically, we show the acceleration of about 74 picocoulombs of charge contained in the core of the trailing bunch in an accelerating gradient of about 4.4 gigavolts per metre. These core particles gain about 1.6 gigaelectronvolts of energy per particle, with a final energy spread as low as 0.7 per cent (2.0 per cent on average), and an energy-transfer efficiency from the wake to the bunch that can exceed 30 per cent (17.7 per cent on average). This acceleration of a distinct bunch of electrons containing a substantial charge and having a small energy spread with both a high accelerating gradient and a high energy-transfer efficiency represents a milestone in the development of plasma wakefield acceleration into a compact and affordable accelerator technology.},

The channel also provides guiding for intense laser pulses used for wakefield excitation.

abstract = {Particle-in-cell (PIC) methods have a long history in the study of laser-plasma interactions. Early electromagnetic codes used the Yee staggered grid for field variables combined with a leapfrog EM-field update and the Boris algorithm for particle pushing. The general properties of such schemes are well documented. Modern PIC codes tend to add to these high-order shape functions for particles, Poisson preserving field updates, collisions, ionisation, a hybrid scheme for solid density and high-field QED effects. In addition to these physics packages, the increase in computing power now allows simulations with real mass ratios, full 3D dynamics and multi-speckle interaction. This paper presents a review of the core algorithms used in current laser-plasma specific PIC codes. Also reported are estimates of self-heating rates, convergence of collisional routines and test of ionisation models which are not readily available elsewhere. Having reviewed the status of PIC algorithms we present a summary of recent applications of such codes in laser-plasma physics, concentrating on SRS, short-pulse laser-solid interactions, fast-electron transport, and QED effects.},

These plasmas play a fundamental role in the dynamics of ultra-massive astrophysical objects and are believed to be associated with the emission of ultra-bright gamma-ray bursts. Despite extensive theoretical modelling, our knowledge of this state of matter is still speculative, owing to the extreme difficulty in recreating neutral matter-antimatter plasmas in the laboratory. Here we show that, by using a compact laser-driven setup, ion-free electron-positron plasmas with unique characteristics can be produced. Their charge neutrality (same amount of matter and antimatter), high-density and small divergence finally open up the possibility of studying electron-positron plasmas in controlled laboratory experiments.},

We present analytic calculations of the energy-angular spectra and photon yield that parametrize the influences of the electron and laser beam parameters to allow source design. These calculations, combined with numerical simulations, are applied to evaluate sources using conventional scattering in vacuum and methods for improving the source via laser waveguides or plasma channels. We show that the photon flux can be greatly increased by using a plasma channel to guide the laser during the interaction. Conversely, we show that to produce a given number of photons, the required laser energy can be reduced by an order of magnitude through the use of a plasma channel. In addition, we show that a plasma can be used as a compact beam dump, in which the electron beam is decelerated in a short distance, thereby greatly reducing radiation shielding. Realistic experimental errors such as transverse jitter are quantitatively shown to be tolerable. Examples of designs relevant to nuclear resonance fluorescence and photofission are provided.},

abstract = {Plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA) has demonstrated the ability to produce very high gradients to accelerate electrons and positrons. In PWFA, a drive bunch of charged particles passes through a uniform plasma, thereby generating a wakefield that accelerates a witness bunch traveling behind the drive bunch. This process works well for electrons, but much less so for positrons due to the positive charge attracting rather than repealing the plasma electrons, which leads to reduced acceleration gradient, halo formation, and emittance growth. This problem can be alleviated by having the positron beam travel through a hollow plasma channel. Presented are modeling results for producing 10-100 cm long hollow plasma channels suitable for positron PWFA. These channels are created utilizing laser-induced gas breakdown in hydrogen gas. The results show that hollow channels with plasma densities of order 1016cm-3 and inner channel radii of order 20$\mu$m are possible using currently available terawatt-level lasers. At these densities and radii, preliminary positron PWFA modeling indicates that longitudinal electric fields on axis can exceed 3GV/m. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In this article, we review the phenomenon of dispersion, paying particular attention to its impact in the optics of ultrashort pulses, as well as its measurement and management. At present, lasers generating coherent bandwidths of several hundred nanometers have been demonstrated and correspondingly short pulses of 10 fs or so are quite usual. The limits to the breadth of optical spectra and brevity of pulse durations that may be achieved are often set by the dispersive properties of the linear optical elements of which the source is constructed. Progress in ultrafast optics to date has therefore relied extensively on the development of ways to characterize and manipulate dispersion. The means by which this can be accomplished are significantly different for laser oscillators and laser amplifiers, as well as for nonlinear interactions that are used to extend the range of frequencies at which short optical pulses are available, but in all cases it is this phenomenon that determines the output of current optical sources. {\textcopyright} 2001 American Institute of Physics. {\textcopyright} 2001 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {The propagation characteristics of a hollow Gaussian laser beam (HGB) in a tapered plasma channel are studied by simultaneously considering the effects of relativistic self-focusing, ponderomotive self-channeling, and preformed channel focusing. A differential equation of the laser width parameter is derived by using the paraxial like approximation, and the critical surface that classifies the evolution behaviors of the HGB into focusing and defocusing is obtained theoretically. For verification, some numerical results are also given. It is found that the focusing ability of the HGB is proportional to the density of the tapered plasma channel, but it weakens with the increase in the order of the HGB. Furthermore, we also find that for the Gaussian laser beam, when the transverse plasma density is homogeneous, its focusing ability is stronger than that of the HGB with n¼ 3, while the trend just reverses when the transverse plasma density is parabolic.},

abstract = {Precise characterization and tailoring of the spatial and temporal evolution of plasma density within plasma sources are critical for realizing high-quality accelerated beams in plasma wakefield accelerators. The simultaneous use of two independent diagnostics allowed the temporally and spatially resolved detection of plasma density with unprecedented sensitivity and enabled the characterization of the plasma temperature in discharge capillaries for times later than 0.5 $\mu$s after the initiation of the discharge, at which point the plasma is at local thermodynamic equilibrium. A common-path two-color laser interferometer for obtaining the average plasma density with a sensitivity of 2 × 1015 cm-2 was developed together with a plasma emission spectrometer for analyzing spectral line broadening profiles with a resolution of 5 × 1015 cm-3. Both diagnostics show good agreement when applying the spectral line broadening analysis methodology of Gigosos and Carde{\~{n}}oso in the temperature range of 0.5 eV-5.0 eV. For plasma with densities of 0.5-2.5 × 1017 cm-3, temperatures of 1 eV-7 eV were indirectly measured by combining the diagnostic information. Measured longitudinally resolved plasma density profiles exhibit a clear temporal evolution from an initial flat-top to a Gaussian-like shape in the first microseconds as material is ejected out from the capillary. These measurements pave the way for highly detailed parameter tuning in plasma sources for particle accelerators and beam optics.},

The method is based on expanding the projection in a basis set of functions that are analytical projections of known well-behaved functions. The original 3D image can then be reconstructed as a linear combination of these well-behaved functions, which have a Gaussian-like shape, with the same expansion coefficients as the projection. In the process of finding the expansion coefficients, regularization is used to achieve a more reliable reconstruction of noisy projections. The method is efficient and computationally cheap and is particularly well suited for transforming projections obtained in photoion and photoelectron imaging experiments. It can be used for any image with cylindrical symmetry, requires minimal user's input, and provides a reliable reconstruction in certain cases when the commonly used Fourier–Hankel Abel transform method fails},

The transition between relativistically self-guided and channel-assisted guiding is seen in the simulations and in the behaviour of the production of electron beams. We also show that by improving the quality of the driving laser beam the threshold laser energy required to produce electron beams can be reduced by a factor of almost 2.

We use particle-in-cell simulations to show that the leading edge of the conditioning pulse ionizes the neutral gas collar to generate a deep, low-loss plasma channel which guides the bulk of the conditioning pulse itself as well as any subsequently injected pulses. In proof-of-principle experiments we generate conditioned HOFI (CHOFI) waveguides with axial electron densities of $n_\mathrm{e0} \approx 1 \times 10^{17} \; \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, and a matched spot size of $26 \; \mathrm{\mu m}$. The power attenuation length of these CHOFI channels is $L_\mathrm{att} = (21 \pm 3) \; \mathrm{m}$, more than two orders of magnitude longer than achieved by HOFI channels. Hydrodynamic and particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that meter-scale CHOFI waveguides with attenuation lengths exceeding 1 m could be generated with a total laser pulse energy of only $1.2$ J per meter of channel. The properties of CHOFI channels are ideally suited to many applications in high-intensity light-matter interactions, including multi-GeV plasma accelerator stages operating at high pulse repetition rates.},

abstract = {We report guiding of intense (I = 1.3±0.7×1017 W/cm2) 80 fs laser pulses with negligible spectral distortion through 1.5-cm-long preformed helium plasma channels. Channels were formed by axicon-focused laser pulses of either 0.3 J energy, 100 ps duration, after preionizing a 200-700 Torr backfill of He gas to ne ∼ 1016cm-3 with a pulsed electrical discharge; or 0.6-1.1 J energy, 400 ps duration, which required neither preionization nor intentional impurities for seeding. Transverse interferometry showed that He was fully ionized on the channel axis in both cases. Identical femtosecond pulses suffered substantial ionization-induced blueshifts after propagating through Ar and Ne channels of similar dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Kane1993,
abstract = {We introduce a new technique, which we call frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG), for characterizing and displaying arbitrary femtosecond pulses. The method is simple, general, broad-band, and does not require a reference pulse. Using virtually any instantaneous nonlinear-optical effect, FROG involves measuring the spectrum of the signal pulse as a function of the delay between two input pulses. The resulting trace of intensity versus frequency and delay is related to the pulse's spectrogram, a visually intuitive transform containing both time and frequency information. We prove, using phase retrieval concepts, that the FROG trace yields the full intensity I(t) and phase phi(t) of an arbitrary ultrashort pulse with no physically significant ambiguities. We argue, in analogy with acoustics problems, that the FROG trace is in many ways as useful a representation of the pulse as the field itself. FROG appears to have temporal resolution limited only by the response of the nonlinear medium. We demonstrate the method using self-diffraction via the electronic Kerr effect in BK-7 glass and few muJ, 620 nm, linearly chirped, approximately 200 fs pulses.},

Knowledge of the on-axis plasma density is critical. Traditional density interferometry has been ineffective for these laser-machined structures, while group velocity delay (GVD) techniques involve combining two laser paths with corresponding alignment complexities and stability sensitivities. Here the GVD technique is advanced to a common-path two-color interferometer configuration performed in the spectral domain of a broad-bandwidth femtosecond laser. Multi-shot tracking of the phase is not required, and the common path assures improved stability. This in situ technique was validated on 15 mm long plasma structures, measuring electron densities of 1017–1018 cm−3 for various fill pressures.},

abstract = {This study attempted to determine the optimal temperature and initial cultivation pH by conducting a series of batch tests in stirred-tank bioreactor using fructose-producing wastewater as an organic substrate. The bioreactor temperature was controlled at 35-55°C with an initial pH of 4-8. Hydrogen production efficiency was assessed using specific hydrogen production potential (SHPP) and the maximum specific hydrogen production rate (SHPRm). Experimental results indicated that temperature and initial pH markedly affected SHPP and SHPRm, volatile fatty acids distribution as well as the ratio of butyrate/acetate (BHu/HAc). Two-fold higher SHPP and SHPRm were obtained at thermophilic condition (55°C) than those at mesophilic condition (35°C). The optimal initial pH was 6 for hydrogen production with peak values of SHPP of 166.8 ml-H2/g-COD and SHPRm of 26.7 ml-H2/g-VSS-h for fructose-processing wastewater. Molasses-processing wastewater had a higher SHPP (187.0 ml-H2/g-COD) and SHPRm (42.7 ml-H2/gVSS-h) than fructose-processing wastewater at pH 6. The DGGE profiles indicated that molasses-processing wastewater is a better substrate than fructose-processing wastewater for growth of hydrogen-producing bacteria due to the high staining intensity of bands. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Diffractive spreading of a laser pulse imposes severe limitations on the acceleration length and maximum electron energy in the laser wake field accelerator (LWFA). Optical guiding of a laser pulse via plasma channels can extend the laser-plasma interaction distance over many Rayleigh lengths. Energy efficient coupling of laser pulses into and through plasma channels is very important for optimal LWFA performance. Results from simulation parameter studies on channel guiding using the particle-in-cell (PIC) code VORPAL [C. Nieter and J. R. Cary, J. Comput. Phys. 196, 448 (2004)] are presented and discussed. The effects that density ramp length and the position of the laser pulse focus have on coupling into channels are considered. Moreover, the effect of laser energy leakage out of the channel domain and the effects of tunneling ionization of a neutral gas on the guided laser pulse are also investigated. Power spectral diagnostics were developed and used to separate pump depletion from energy leakage. The results of these simulations show that increasing the density ramp length decreases the efficiency of coupling a laser pulse to a channel and increases the energy loss when the pulse is vacuum focused at the channel entrance. Then, large spot size oscillations result in increased energy leakage. To further analyze the coupling, a differential equation is derived for the laser spot size evolution in the plasma density ramp and channel profiles are simulated. From the numerical solution of this equation, the optimal spot size and location for coupling into a plasma channel with a density ramp are determined. This result is confirmed by the PIC simulations. They show that specifying a vacuum focus location of the pulse in front of the top of the density ramp leads to an actual focus at the top of the ramp due to plasma focusing, resulting in reduced spot size oscillations. In this case, the leakage is significantly reduced and is negligibly affected by ramp length, allowing for efficient use of channels with long ramps. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {This report presents the conceptual design of a new European research infrastructure EuPRAXIA. The concept has been established over the last four years in a unique collaboration of 41 laboratories within a Horizon 2020 design study funded by the European Union. EuPRAXIA is the first European project that develops a dedicated particle accelerator research infrastructure based on novel plasma acceleration concepts and laser technology. It focuses on the development of electron accelerators and underlying technologies, their user communities, and the exploitation of existing accelerator infrastructures in Europe. EuPRAXIA has involved, amongst others, the international laser community and industry to build links and bridges with accelerator science — through realising synergies, identifying disruptive ideas, innovating, and fostering knowledge exchange. The Eu-PRAXIA project aims at the construction of an innovative electron accelerator using laser- and electron-beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration that offers a significant reduction in size and possible savings in cost over current state-of-the-art radiofrequency-based accelerators. The foreseen electron energy range of one to five gigaelectronvolts (GeV) and its performance goals will enable versatile applications in various domains, e.g. as a compact free-electron laser (FEL), compact sources for medical imaging and positron generation, table-top test beams for particle detectors, as well as deeply penetrating X-ray and gamma-ray sources for material testing. EuPRAXIA is designed to be the required stepping stone to possible future plasma-based facilities, such as linear colliders at the high-energy physics (HEP) energy frontier. Consistent with a high-confidence approach, the project includes measures to retire risk by establishing scaled technology demonstrators. This report includes preliminary models for project implementation, cost and schedule that would allow operation of the full Eu-PRAXIA facility within 8—10 years.},

abstract = {We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel experimental scheme to generate high on-axis peak intensity, segmented, smooth, zero-order quasi-Bessel beams with tunable ranges. Illuminating the axicon with hollow Gaussian beams (HGBs) of different orders, we have generated Bessel beams of varying ranges at different positions away from the axicon. The presence of a dark core at the center of the HGBs removes the effect of imperfection in the axicon tip. As a result, the entire power of the input beam is transformed into a zero-order Bessel beam without any on-axis intensity modulation. We observe the decrease in range and increase in on-axis peak intensity of the zero-order Bessel beam with the order of HGBs. Controlling the superposition of the HGBs of different orders to the axicon, we have demonstrated the increase in the range of the Bessel beam. The current technique can also produce Bessel beams of different intensity distributions, including single-peak or multiple-peak Bessel beams. Using single-pass second-harmonic generation in nonlinear crystals of different lengths, we have further verified the increase of on-axis peak intensity of the Bessel beam with the order of the HGBs and the increase in the range of the Bessel beam due to the superposed HGBs.},

abstract = {The propagation of an intense (a0 =3), short-pulse (L∼ $\lambda$p) laser through a homogeneous plasma has been investigated. Using two-dimensional simulations for a0 =3, the pulse-length and spot-size at three different plasma densities were optimized in order to get a better quality beam in laser wakefield accelerator. The study reveals that with increasing pulse-length the acceleration increases, but after a certain pulse-length (L>0.23 $\lambda$p) the emittance blows-up unacceptably. For spot-sizes less than that given by kp0rs =2 a 0, trapping is poor or nonexistent, and the optimal spot-size is larger. The deviation of the optimal spot-size from this formula increases as the density decreases. The efficacy of these two-dimensional simulations has been validated by running three-dimensional simulations at the highest density. It has been shown that good quality GeV-class beams can be obtained at plasma densities of ∼ 1018 cm-3. The quality of the beam can be substantially improved by selecting only the high-energy peak; in this fashion an energy-spread of better than 1\% and a current in tens of kA can be achieved, which are important for applications such as free-electron lasers. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Laser wakefield acceleration of electrons usually offers an axisymmetry around the laser propagation axis. Thus, the accelerating electrons that are focused on axis often execute small transverse oscillations. In this Article, we propose a simple scheme to break this symmetry, which enhances the transverse wiggling of electrons and boosts the betatron radiation emission. Through 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we show that sending the laser with a small angle of incidence on a transverse plasma density gradient generates an asymmetric wakefield. It first provokes injection and then increases the wiggling of the electrons through the transverse shifting of the wakefield axis which occurs when the laser pulse leaves the gradient. Consequently, we show that the radiated energy per unit of charge can increase by a factor $>20$ when using this scheme, and that the critical energy of the radiation quintuples compared with a reference case without the transverse density gradient.},

abstract = {A new scheme for accelerating positively charged particles in a plasma-wakefield accelerator is proposed. If the proton drive beam propagates in a hollow plasma channel, and the beam radius is of order of the channel width, the space charge force of the driver causes charge separation at the channel wall, which helps to focus the positively charged witness bunch propagating along the beam axis. In the channel, the acceleration buckets for positively charged particles are much larger than in the blowout regime of the uniform plasma, and stable acceleration over long distances is possible. In addition, phasing of the witness with respect to the wave can be tuned by changing the radius of the channel to ensure the acceleration is optimal. Two-dimensional simulations suggest that, for proton drivers likely available in future, positively charged particles can be stably accelerated over 1 km with the average acceleration gradient of 1.3 GeV/m.},

The method is based on expanding the projection in a basis set of functions that are analytical projections of known well-behaved functions. The original 3D image can then be reconstructed as a linear combination of these well-behaved functions, which have a Gaussian-like shape, with the same expansion coefficients as the projection. In the process of finding the expansion coefficients, regularization is used to achieve a more reliable reconstruction of noisy projections. The method is efficient and computationally cheap and is particularly well suited for transforming projections obtained in photoion and photoelectron imaging experiments. It can be used for any image with cylindrical symmetry, requires minimal user's input, and provides a reliable reconstruction in certain cases when the commonly used Fourier–Hankel Abel transform method fails},

Position of the shock wave center and time delay were the major parameters used for shaping the density profiles.

An analytic condition describing quasi-matched laser propagation (i.e., when the second order normalized-intensity-weighted transverse moment of the laser-pulse remain constant) is obtained. For any arbitrary temporal laser pulse profile and any prescribed transverse density profile in the channel, we determine the laser intensity distribution along the pulse, i.e., the slice-dependent laser waist, ensuring quasi-matched propagation. For the case of a Gaussian laser with an initially uniform spot throughout the pulse, we determine the optimal channel depth that minimizes spot size oscillations. The analytical and semi-analytical results obtained for both cases are validated through comparison with numerical simulations. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In this paper, some recent developments in the area of laser-driven plasma wakefield accelerators are reviewed. In particular, we discuss the acceleration of electrons by laser-induced plasma wakes in the so-called blowout regime. In this regime, the laser pulse is sufficiently intense to completely blowout all the plasma electrons and create a cavity or a bubble comprising plasma ions. The plasma electrons are attracted back toward the axis of propagation and form a thin sheath around the ions. The transverse and longitudinal electric fields of this cavity have desirable characteristics for accelerating a high-quality electron beam. In this blowout regime, the laser pulse can be self-guided by the wake it creates over tens of Rayleigh lengths until it is fully pump depleted. The mechanisms for producing such nonlinear wakes in plasmas, injecting electrons into the wakes so that they can be accelerated, competing instabilities that can adversely affect the beam quality, and recent experimental progress are discussed.},

The group velocity of a mismatched laser pulse, for which the laser spot size is strongly oscillating, is found to be independent of propagation distance and significantly less than that of a matched pulse. Laser pulse lengthening of a mismatched pulse owing to laser mode slippage is examined and found to dominate over that due to dispersive pulse spreading for sufficiently long pulses.

Thus, fast and accurate simulation codes are indispensable tools in the study of this extremely important problem. We have developed a novel algorithm that deals with the propagation of axisymmetric bunches of otherwise arbitrary profile through a cold plasma of uniform density. In contrast to the existing PWFA simulation tools, our code plebs (plasma-electron beam simulations) uses a new computational scheme which ensures that the transverse and longitudinal directions are completely decoupled - a feature which significantly enhances the speed and robustness of the new method. Our numerical results are benchmarked against the QuickPIC code and excellent agreement is established between the two approaches. Moreover, our new technique provides a very convenient framework for studying issues such as beam loading and short-range wakefields within the plasma cavity.},

abstract = {A one-dimensional dissipative magnetohydrodynamics code is used to investigate the discharge dynamics of a waveguide for high-intensity laser pulses: the gas-filled capillary discharge waveguide. Simulations are performed for the conditions of a recent experimental measurement of the electron density profile in hydrogen-filled capillaries [D. J. Spence et al., Phys. Rev. E 63, 015401 (R) (2001)], and are found to be in good agreement with those results. The evolution of the discharge in this device is found to be substantially different to that found in Z-pinch capillary discharges, owing to the fact that the plasma pressure is always much higher than the magnetic pressure. Three stages of the capillary discharge are identified. During the last of these the distribution of plasma inside the capillary is determined by the balance between ohmic heating, and cooling due to electron heat conduction. A simple analytical model of the discharge during the final stage is presented, and shown to be in good agreement with the magnetohydrodynamic simulations. {\textcopyright} 2001 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Laser-plasma wakefield accelerators have seen tremendous progress, now capable of producing quasi-monoenergetic electron beams in the GeV energy range with few-femtoseconds bunch duration. Scaling these accelerators to the nanocoulomb range would yield hundreds of kiloamperes peak current and stimulate the next generation of radiation sources covering high-field THz, high-brightness X-ray and $\gamma$-ray sources, compact free-electron lasers and laboratory-size beam-driven plasma accelerators. However, accelerators generating such currents operate in the beam loading regime where the accelerating field is strongly modified by the self-fields of the injected bunch, potentially deteriorating key beam parameters. Here we demonstrate that, if appropriately controlled, the beam loading effect can be employed to improve the accelerator's performance. Self-Truncated ionization injection enables loading of unprecedented charges of {\^{a}}=0.5 nC within a mono-energetic peak. As the energy balance is reached, we show that the accelerator operates at the theoretically predicted optimal loading condition and the final energy spread is minimized.},

The flying focus generates a short effective pulse duration with a small diameter focal spot that co- or counter-propagates along the optical axis at any velocity. Experiments validating the concept measured subluminal (-0.09c) to superluminal (39c) focal spot velocities with a nearly constant peak intensity over 4.5 mm. Experiments that increased the peak intensity above the ionization threshold for gas demonstrated ionization waves propagating at the velocity of the flying focus. These ionization waves of any velocity overcome several laser-plasma propagation issues, including ionization-induced refraction. The flying focus presents opportunities to overcome current fundamental limitations in laser-plasma amplifiers, laser wakefield accelerators, photon accelerators, and high-order frequency conversion.},

Because the Fourier transform has an infinite order of accuracy, only two cells per wavelength are required, compared to 8-16 cells per wavelength required by the FDTD method for the same accuracy. The wraparound effect, a major limitation caused by the periodicity assumed in the FFT, is removed by using Berenger's perfectly matched layers.

The structure of the wakefield has been characterized and its amplitude compared with the amplitude of the wake generated by a single (coherent) laser pulse. We show that, in spite of the incoherent nature of the wakefield within the volume occupied by the laser pulses, behind this region, the structure of the wakefield can be regular with an amplitude comparable or equal to that obtained from a single pulse with the same energy. Wake generation requires that the incoherent structures in the laser energy density produced by the combined pulses exist on a time scale short compared to the plasma period. Incoherent combination of multiple laser pulses may enable a technologically simpler path to high-repetition rate, high-average power laser-plasma accelerators, and associated applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) and its particle-driven counterpart, plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA), are commonly treated as separate, though related branches of high-gradient plasma-based acceleration. However, novel proposed schemes are increasingly residing at the interface of both concepts where the understanding of their interplay becomes crucial. Here, we report on experiments covering a wide range of parameters by using nanocoulomb-class quasi-monoenergetic electron beams from LWFA with a 100-TW-class laser. Based on a controlled electron injection, these beams reach record-level performance in terms of laser-to-beam energy transfer efficiency (up to 10\%), spectral charge density (regularly exceeding 10 pC/MeV) and divergence (1 mrad full width at half maximum divergence). The impact of charge fluctuations on the energy spectra of electron bunches is assessed for different laser parameters, including a few-cycle laser, followed by a presentation of results on beam loading in LWFA with two electron bunches. This scenario is particularly promising to provide high-quality electron beams by using one of the bunches to either tailor the laser wakefield via beam loading or to drive its own, beam-dominated wakefield. We present experimental evidence for the latter, showing a varying acceleration of a low-energy witness beam with respect to the charge of a high-energy drive beam in a spatially separate gas target. With the increasing availability of petawatt-class lasers the access to this new regime of laser-plasma wakefield acceleration will be further facilitated, thus providing new paths towards low-emittance beam generation for future plasma-based colliders or light sources.},

The gas cell was designed to study controlled injection of electrons into a laser-driven wakefield at the Astra Gemini laser facility. The target consists of two compartments: an accelerator and an injector section connected via an aperture. A sharp transition between the peak and plateau density regions in the injector and accelerator compartments, respectively, was observed in simulations with various inlet pressures. The fluid simulations indicate that the length of the down-ramp connecting the sections depends on the aperture diameter, as does the density drop outside the entrance and the exit cones. Further studies showed, that increasing the inlet pressure leads to turbulence and strong fluctuations in density along the axial profile during target filling, and consequently, is expected to negatively impact the accelerator stability.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Optical Society of America.We present an analytical formalism elucidating how information is stored in chirped optical probes by describing the effects of sinusoidal temporal modulations on the electric field. We show that the modulations produce spectral sidebands which can be interpreted as temporal sidebands due to the time-wavelength mapping, an effect we call temporally encoded spectral shifting (TESS). A derivation is presented for the case of chirped-pulse spectral interferometry showing how to recover both the amplitude and the periodicity of the modulation from a Fourier transform of the interferogram. The TESS effect, which provides an intuitive picture for interpreting pump-probe experiments with chirped pulses, is illustrated for probing wakefields from a laser-plasma accelerator.},

A space-averaged maximum temperature of 3.3 eV with electron densities of the order of 10 17 cm-3 was observed at a discharge time of 150 ns and a maximum discharge current of 200 A. One-dimensional dissipative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code was used to analyze the discharge dynamics in the gas-filled capillary discharge waveguide for high-intensity laser pulses.

We compared the temporal behavior of the electron temperature and the radial electron density profiles, measured in the experiment with the results of the numerical simulations.

abstract = {High Mach number blast waves were created by focusing a laser pulse on a solid pin, surrounded by nitrogen or xenon gas. In xenon, the initial shock is strongly radiative, sending out a supersonic radiative heat wave far ahead of itself. The shock propagates into the heated gas, diminishing in strength as it goes. The radiative heat wave also slows, and when its Mach number drops to two with respect to the downstream plasma, the heat wave drives a second shock ahead of itself to satisfy mass and momentum conservation in the heat wave reference frame; the heat wave becomes subsonic behind the second shock. For some time both shocks are observed simultaneously. Eventually the initial shock diminishes in strength so much that it can longer be observed, but the second shock continues to propagate long after this time. This sequence of events is a new phenomenon that has not previously been discussed in the literature. Numerical simulation clarifies the origin of the second shock, and its position is consistent with an analytical estimate. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

The electrons are then transversely scattered by the laser pulse, and penetrate the capillary wall where they generate bremsstrahlung radiation, modeled using geant4 simulations. The signature of bremsstrahlung radiation is detected using an x-ray camera, together with the betatron radiation emitted during electron acceleration in the plasma bubble. The reflection of betatron radiation from the inner capillary surface also accounts for a fraction of the observed signal on the x-ray camera. The simulation results are in agreement with the experimental ones and provide a detailed description of the electron and radiation properties, useful for the design of laser wakefield accelerators or radiation sources using long plasma media. {\textcopyright} Published by the American Physical Society.},

A plasma channel guided the drive laser over long distances, resulting in production of the high-energy, high-quality beams. Unchanneled experiments varying the length of the target plasma indicated that the high-quality bunches are produced near the dephasing length and demonstrated that channel guiding was more stable and efficient than relativistic self-guiding. Consistent with these data, particle-in-cell simulations indicate production of high-quality electron beams when trapping of an initial bunch of electrons suppresses further injection by loading the wake. The injected electron bunch is then compressed in energy by dephasing, when the front of the bunch begins to decelerate while the tail is still accelerated. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

Analytic estimates, and simulations using a one-dimensional Bessel-beam-plasma interaction code consistently explain the experimental observations. These results are for longer, moderate intensity pulses where the self-trapping channel is induced by laser-heated plasma thermal pressure. To explore the extension of this effect to ultrashort, intense pulsed Bessel beams, we perform propagation simulations using the code WAKE [Phys. Rev. E 53, R2068 (1996)].

abstract = {We have investigated the role that the transverse electric field of the laser plays in the acceleration of electrons in a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) operating in the quasi-blowout regime through particle-in-cell code simulations. In order to ensure that longitudinal compression and/or transverse focusing of the laser pulse is not needed before the wake can self-trap the plasma electrons, we have employed the ionization injection technique. Furthermore, the plasma density is varied such that at the lowest densities, the laser pulse occupies only a fraction of the first wavelength of the wake oscillation (the accelerating bucket), whereas at the highest density, the same duration laser pulse fills the entire first bucket. Although the trapped electrons execute betatron oscillations due to the ion column in all cases, at the lowest plasma density they do not interact with the laser field and the energy gain is all due to the longitudinal wakefield. However, as the density is increased, there can be a significant contribution to the maximum energy due to direct laser acceleration (DLA) of those electrons that undergo betatron motion in the plane of the polarization of the laser pulse. Eventually, DLA can be the dominant energy gain mechanism over acceleration due to the longitudinal field at the highest densities.},

abstract = {We measured the parameter reproducibility and radial electron density profile of capillary discharge waveguides with diameters of 650 to 2 mm and lengths of 9 to 40 cm. To the best of the authors' knowledge, 40 cm is the longest discharge capillary plasma waveguide to date. This length is important for 10 GeV electron energy gain in a single laser-driven plasma wakefield acceleration stage. Evaluation of waveguide parameter variations showed that their focusing strength was stable and reproducible to <![CDATA[$\% and their average on-axis plasma electron density to <![CDATA[$\%. These variations explain only a small fraction of laser-driven plasma wakefield acceleration electron bunch variations observed in experiments to date. Measurements of laser pulse centroid oscillations revealed that the radial channel profile rises faster than parabolic and is in excellent agreement with magnetohydrodynamic simulation results. We show that the effects of non-parabolic contributions on Gaussian pulse propagation were negligible when the pulse was approximately matched to the channel. However, they affected pulse propagation for a non-matched configuration in which the waveguide was used as a plasma telescope to change the focused laser pulse spot size.},

The wave equations for laser pulse propagation in a gas undergoing ionization and in a plasma are derived. The source-dependent expansion method is discussed, which is a general method for solving the paraxial wave equation with nonlinear source terms. In gases, the propagation of high-power (near the critical power) laser pulses is considered including the effects of diffraction, nonlinear self-focusing, ionization, and plasma generation. Self-guided solutions and the stability of these solutions are discussed. In plasmas, optical guiding by relativistic effects, ponderomotive effects, and preformed density channels is considered. The self-consistent plasma response is discussed, including plasma wave effects and instabilities such as self-modulation. Recent experiments on the guiding of laser pulses in gases and in plasmas are briefly summarized.},

The evolution and propagation of non-Gaussian laser pulses in leaky channels are studied, and it is shown that, for appropriate laser-plasma parameters, the higher-order laser mode content of the pulse may be removed while the fundamental mode remains well-guided. The behavior of multi-mode laser pulses is described analytically and numerically using envelope equations, including the derivation of the leakage coefficients, and compared to particle-in-cell simulations.

abstract = {The advent of ultraintense laser pulses generated by the technique of chirped pulse amplification (CPA) along with the development of high-fluence laser materials has opened up an entirely new field of optics. The electromagnetic field intensities produced by these techniques, in excess of 1018 W cm2, lead to relativistic electron motion in the laser field. The CPA method is reviewed and the future growth of laser technique is discussed, including the prospect of generating the ultimate power of a zettawatt. A number of consequences of relativistic-strength optical fields are surveyed. In contrast to the nonrelativistic regime, these laser fields are capable of moving matter more effectively, including motion in the direction of laser propagation. One of the consequences of this is wakefield generation, a relativistic version of optical rectification, in which longitudinal field effects could be as large as the transverse ones. In addition to this, other effects may occur, including relativistic focusing, relativistic transparency, nonlinear modulation and multiple harmonic generation, and strong coupling to matter and other fields (such as high-frequency radiation). A proper utilization of these phenomena and effects leads to the new technology of relativistic engineering, in which light-matter interactions in the relativistic regime drives the development of laser-driven accelerator science. A number of significant applications are reviewed, including the fast ignition of an inertially confined fusion target by short-pulsed laser energy and potential sources of energetic particles (electrons, protons, other ions, positrons, pions, etc.). The coupling of an intense laser field to matter also has implications for the study of the highest energies in astrophysics, such as ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays, with energies in excess of 1020 eV. The laser fields can be so intense as to make the accelerating field large enough for general relativistic effects (via the equivalence principle) to be examined in the laboratory. It will also enable one to access the nonlinear regime of quantum electrodynamics, where the effects of radiative damping are no longer negligible. Furthermore, when the fields are close to the Schwinger value, the vacuum can behave like a nonlinear medium in much the same way as ordinary dielectric matter expanded to laser radiation in the early days of laser research. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

Plasma-based accelerators are particularly attractive because they are capable of producing accelerating fields that are orders of magnitude larger than those used in conventional colliders. In these accelerators, a drive beam (either laser or particle) produces a plasma wave (wakefield) that accelerates charged particles. The ultimate utility of plasma accelerators will depend on sustaining ultrahigh accelerating fields over a substantial length to achieve a significant energy gain. Here we show that an energy gain of more than 42 GeV is achieved in a plasma wakefield accelerator of 85 cm length, driven by a 42 GeV electron beam at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The results are in excellent agreement with the predictions of three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Most of the beam electrons lose energy to the plasma wave, but some electrons in the back of the same beam pulse are accelerated with a field of ∼52 GV m-1. This effectively doubles their energy, producing the energy gain of the 3-km-long SLAC accelerator in less than a metre for a small fraction of the electrons in the injected bunch. This is an important step towards demonstrating the viability of plasma accelerators for high-energy physics applications. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Andrae2010,
abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

abstract = {The problem of an unsteady cylindrical blast-wave interaction with a flat plate is numerically investigated. The numerical simulation aims at the understanding of blast-wave propagation, reflection, and its transition phenomenon as well as the flow features induced by the blast wave. A fifth-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme for spatial discretization associated with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for time integration is employed for solving the two-dimensional Euler/Navier-Stokes equations in a finite volume fashion. To verify the accuracy of the numerical solver developed, several problems were tested. The computed results for the test problems are shown to be accurate in comparison with experimental data. To study the flowfield of a blast wave, the problem of blast-wave propagation in a free field is explored first. Two types of initial conditions are considered. A contact-surface instability that developed around a contact surface was found in the problem with the first kind of initial condition. Next, the problem of the blast-wave interaction with the flat plate is investigated. The flow structure of a shock-shock interaction induced by the unsteady blast wave and its evolution are studied in detail. It was found that the lower the height of burst or the higher the shock Mach number, the earlier the occurrence of the transition from a regular reflection to a Mach reflection and the higher the triple points.},

Scanning the laser centroid position at the input of the channel and recording the exit position allow determination of the channel depth with an accuracy of a few percent, measurement of the transverse channel shape, and inference of the matched spot size. In addition, accurate alignment of the laser beam through the plasma channel is provided by minimizing laser centroid motion at the channel exit as the channel depth is scanned either by scanning the plasma density or the discharge timing.

In the present work, such simulations are performed using the code MARPLE. First, the process of capillary filling with cold hydrogen before the discharge is fired, through the side supply channels is simulated. Second, the simulation of the capillary discharge is performed with the goal to obtain a time-dependent spatial distribution of the electron density near the open ends of the capillary as well as inside the capillary.

The frequency evolution of the initially 50 fs (FWHM) long laser pulse by photon interaction with the wake followed by plasma dispersion enhances the wake which eventually leads to self-injection of electrons from the channel wall. This first bunch of electrons remains spatially highly localized. Its phase space rotation due to slippage with respect to the wake leads to a monoenergetic bunch of electrons with a central energy of 0.26 GeV after 0.55 cm propagation. At later times, spatial bunching of the laser enhances the acceleration of a second bunch of electrons to energies up to 0.84 GeV before the laser pulse intensity is significantly reduced.},

The tail of the pulse, confined in the accelerator cavity (electron density "bubble"), transversely flaps, as the pulse head steadily self-guides. The resulting oscillations of the cavity size cause periodic injection of electrons from ambient plasma, creating an energy comb with the number of components, their energy, and energy separation dependent on the channel radius and pulse length. Accumulation of noise (continuously injected charge) can be prevented using a negatively chirped drive pulse with a bandwidth close to a one-half of the carrier wavelength.

In this geometry the low density in the channel contributes to the focusing forces, while the accelerating fields are determined by the high density in the channel walls. The channel also provides guiding for intense laser pulses used for wakefield excitation. In certain regimes, both electron and positron beams can be accelerated and focused in a nearly symmetric fashion. Near-hollow plasma channels can effectively mitigate emittance growth due to Coulomb scattering for high-energy physics applications.},

By irradiating gas jet targets with ultrashort intense laser pulses, the generation of quasimonoenergetic electron beams was recently observed. Currently, the stability of beam generation and the ability to scale to higher electron beam energies are critical issues for practical laser acceleration. Here, we demonstrate the first generation of stable GeV-class electron beams from stable few-millimetre-long plasma channels in a self-guided wakefield acceleration process. As primary evidence of the laser wakefield acceleration in a bubble regime, we observed a boost of both the electron beam energy and quality by reducing the plasma density and increasing the plasma length in a 1-cm-long gas jet. Subsequent three-dimensional simulations show the possibility of achieving even higher electron beam energies by minimizing plasma bubble elongation, and we anticipate dramatic increases in beam energy and quality in the near future. This will pave the way towards ultracompact, all-optical electron beam accelerators and their applications in science, technology and medicine. {\textcopyright} 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Many wakefield acceleration experiments rely on the process of wave breaking, or self-injection, to inject electrons into the wave, while other injection techniques rely on operation without self-injection. We present an experimental study into the parameters, including the pulse energy, focal spot quality, and pulse power, that determine whether or not a wakefield accelerator will self-inject. By taking into account the processes of self-focusing and pulse compression we are able to extend a previously described theoretical model, where the minimum bubble size k pr b required for trapping is not constant but varies slowly with density and find excellent agreement with this model.

abstract = {From plasma-wakefield acceleration as a physics experiment toward a plasma-based accelerator as a user facility, the beam physics issues remaining to be solved are still numerous. Providing beams with high energy, charge, and quality simultaneously, not only within the plasma but also at the user doorstep itself, is the main concern. Despite its tremendous efficiency in particle acceleration, the wakefield displays a complex 3D profile which, associated to the beam-loading field induced by the accelerated beam itself, makes the acceleration of high charge to high energy often incompatible with high beam quality. Beam extraction from the plasma without quality degradation for a transfer either to the next plasma stage or to the user application is another difficulty to consider. This article presents the substantial studies carried out and the different innovative methods employed for tackling all these different issues. Efforts focused on achieving the challenging beam parameters targeted by the EuPRAXIA accelerator facility project. The lessons learned at the end of these in-depth simulations and optimizations are highlighted. The sensitivity to different error sources is also estimated to point out the critical components of such an accelerator. Finally, the needs in terms of laser and plasma parameters are provided.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that an ultrashort high intensity laser pulse can propagate for hundreds of Rayleigh ranges in a prepared neutral hydrogen channel by generating its own plasma waveguide as it propagates; the front of the pulse generates a waveguide that confines the rest of the pulse. A wide range of suitable initial index structures will support this "self-waveguiding" process; the necessary feature is that the gas density on axis is a minimum. Here, we demonstrate self-waveguiding of pulses of at least $1.5\times10^{17} W/cm^2$ (normalized vector potential $a_0\sim0.3)$ over 10 cm, or $\sim100$ Rayleigh ranges, limited only by our laser energy and length of our gas jet. We predict and observe characteristic oscillations corresponding to mode-beating during self-waveguiding. The self-waveguiding pulse leaves in its wake a fully ionized low density plasma waveguide which can guide another pulse injected immediately following; we demonstrate optical guiding of such a follow-on probe pulse},

They arise in the visible and infrared range from femtosecond lasers2, and at shorter wavelengths, in the ultraviolet and X-ray range, from synchrotron sources3 and free-electron lasers4. Recent progress in laser wakefield accelerators has resulted in electron beams with energies from tens of mega-electron volts (refs 5,6,7) to more than 1 GeV within a few centimetres8, with pulse durations predicted to be several femtoseconds9. The enormous progress in improving beam quality and stability5, 6, 7, 8, 10 makes them serious candidates for driving the next generation of ultracompact light sources11. Here, we demonstrate the first successful combination of a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator, producing 55–75 MeV electron bunches, with an undulator to generate visible synchrotron radiation. By demonstrating the wavelength scaling with energy, and narrow-bandwidth spectra, we show the potential for ultracompact and versatile laser-based radiation sources from the infrared to X-ray energies.},

abstract = {Synchrotrons and free-electron lasers are the most powerful sources of X-ray radiation. They constitute invaluable tools for a broad range of research1; however, their dependence on large-scale radiofrequency electron accelerators means that only a few of these sources exist worldwide. Laser-driven plasma-wave accelerators2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 provide markedly increased accelerating fields and hence offer the potential to shrink the size and cost of these X-ray sources to the university-laboratory scale. Here, we demonstrate the generation of soft-X-ray undulator radiation with laser-plasma-accelerated electron beams. The well-collimated beams deliver soft-X-ray pulses with an expected pulse duration of 10 fs (inferred from plasma-accelerator physics). Our source draws on a 30-cm-long undulator11 and a 1.5-cm-long accelerator delivering stable electron beams10 with energies of 210 MeV. The spectrum of the generated undulator radiation typically consists of a main peak centred at a wavelength of 18 nm (fundamental), a second peak near 9 nm (second harmonic) and a high-energy cutoff at 7 nm. Magnetic quadrupole lenses11 ensure efficient electron-beam transport and demonstrate an enabling technology for reproducible generation of tunable undulator radiation. The source is scalable to shorter wavelengths by increasing the electron energy. Our results open the prospect of tunable, brilliant, ultrashort-pulsed X-ray sources for small-scale laboratories.},

abstract = {Laser-driven plasma accelerators can generate accelerating gradients three orders of magnitude larger than radio-frequency accelerators and have achieved beam energies above 1 GeV in centimetre long stages. However, the pulse repetition rate and wall-plug efficiency of plasma accelerators is limited by the driving laser to less than approximately 1 Hz and 0.1{\%} respectively. Here we investigate the prospects for exciting the plasma wave with trains of low-energy laser pulses rather than a single high-energy pulse. Resonantly exciting the wakefield in this way would enable the use of different technologies, such as fibre or thin-disc lasers, which are able to operate at multi-kilohertz pulse repetition rates and with wall-plug efficiencies two orders of magnitude higher than current laser systems. We outline the parameters of efficient, GeV-scale, 10-kHz plasma accelerators and show that they could drive compact X-ray sources with average photon fluxes comparable to those of third-generation light source but with significantly improved temporal resolution. Likewise FEL operation could be driven with comparable peak power but with significantly larger repetition rates than extant FELs.},

Based on our findings, we provide a parametrization to predict the electron energy drift with subpercent accuracy for many hours from measured laser parameters, which opens a path for performance improvements by active stabilization.

abstract = {Generating high-quality laser-plasma accelerated electron beams requires carefully balancing a plethora of physical effects and is therefore challenging - both conceptually and in experiments. Here, we use Bayesian optimization of key laser and plasma parameters to flatten the longitudinal phase space of an ionization-injected electron bunch via optimal beam loading. We first study the concept with particle-in-cell simulations and then demonstrate it in experiments. Starting from an arbitrary set point, the plasma accelerator autonomously tunes the beam energy spread to the subpercent level at 254 MeV and 4.7 pC/MeV spectral density. Finally, we study a robust regime, which improves the stability of the laser-plasma accelerator and delivers sub-five-percent rms energy spread beams for 90{\%} of all shots.},

@article{Huang2006,
abstract = {A highly efficient, fully parallelized, fully relativistic, three-dimensional particle-in-cell model for simulating plasma and laser wakefield acceleration is described. The model is based on the quasi-static or frozen field approximation, which reduces a fully three-dimensional electromagnetic field solve and particle push to a two-dimensional field solve and particle push. This is done by calculating the plasma wake assuming that the drive beam and/or laser does not evolve during the time it takes for it to pass a plasma particle. The complete electromagnetic fields of the plasma wake and its associated index of refraction are then used to evolve the drive beam and/or laser using very large time steps. This algorithm reduces the computational time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Comparison between the new algorithm and conventional fully explicit models (OSIRIS) is presented. The agreement is excellent for problems of interest. Direction for future work is also presented. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, at the low plasma densities required to produce high-energy electrons, in order to avoid capillary wall damage, high power lasers need a tighter transverse confinement that cannot be achieved by the capillary discharge powered by Ohmic heating alone. The introduction of an additional laser for heating of the plasma leads to deeper and narrower plasma channels. Here we investigate the formation of laser-heated axially uniform plasma channels. We show that a high degree of longitudinal uniformity can be achieved despite significant evolution of the heater laser during its propagation through the channel.},

abstract = {At very high light intensities, the electron energy spectrum in multiphoton ionization (MPI) spectroscopy of even the simplest atoms changes from a single, well defined threshold peak into multiple peaks, separated from one another by the photon energy. This phenomenon is generally referred to as 'above-threshold ionization' (ATI). The original experiments investigating ATI used relatively long laser pulses, with the result that amplitudes, energy widths and angular distributions of the individual photoelectron peaks depended on the laser intensity. In addition, the widths of the peaks, as well as their absolute energy positions, changed according to the temporal width of the laser pulse. These dependencies were not intrinsic to the ionization process, but rather were all eventually ascribed to ponderomotive forces exerted on free photoelectrons by the laser focus. The ponderomotive effects frustrated comparisons between theoretical calculations and experimental data. {\textcopyright} 1991 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {In the free-electron laser the resonant interaction between the radiation field and electron beam can result in radiation focusing (optical guiding). If the centroid of the electron beam is transversely displaced off axis, the radiation field, under certain conditions, will follow and be steered by the electron beam. The effect of a spatial modulation on the electron-beam envelope can also modify the propagation characteristics of the radiation. These and other phenomena are analytically and numerically studied using a novel source-dependent Laguerre-Gaussian modal representation of the fully three-dimensional radiation field. Unlike the vacuum Laguerre-Gaussian modal expansion, the longitudinal spatial dependence of the radiation waist and curvature are determined and characterized by the source term in the wave equation. Among the advantages of this general source-dependent expansion approach is that few modes are needed to accurately describe the radiation. Hence, fast and accurate numerical solutions of the fully three-dimensional free-electron laser problem can be obtained over distances of many Rayleigh lengths. Furthermore, this expansion enables us to drive an envelope equation for the radiation beam as well as an expression for the centroid of the beam. {\textcopyright} 1987 The American Physical Society.},

High field gradients lead to nonlocalized phase injection of electrons, and thus broad energy spread beams. However, for long focal-length geometries (w0>$\lambda$p), a single optical filament can capture the majority of the laser energy and self-guide over distances comparable to the dephasing length, even for these short pulses (c$\tau$ $\lambda$p). This allows the wakefield to evolve to the correct shape for the production of the monoenergetic electron bunches, as measured in the experiment. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

It works very well for the first bucket before phase mixing occurs. We separate the plasma response into a cavity or blowout region void of all electrons and a sheath of electrons just beyond the cavity. This simple model permits the derivation of a single equation for the boundary of the cavity. It works particularly well for narrow electron bunches and for short lasers with spot sizes matched to the radius of the cavity. It is also used to describe the structure of both the accelerating and focusing fields in the wake. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Electron beams and betatron X-ray radiation generated by laser wakefield acceleration in long plasma targets are studied. The targets consist of hydrogen filled dielectric capillary tubes of diameter 150 to 200 microns and length 6 to 20 mm. Electron beams are observed for peak laser intensities as low as 5 × 1017 W/cm2. It is found that the capillary collects energy outside the main peak of the focal spot and contributes to keep the beam self-focused over a distance longer than in a gas jet of similar density. This enables the pulse to evolve enough to reach the threshold for wavebreaking, and thus trap and accelerate electrons. No electrons were observed for capillaries of large diameter (250 ?m), confirming that the capillary influences the interaction and does not have the same behaviour as a gas cell. Finally, X-rays are used as a diagnostic of the interaction and, in particular, to estimate the position of the electrons trapping point inside the capillary. {\textcopyright} 2011. The Author(s).},

Therefore, beam diagnostics different from those known from classical particle accelerators such as synchrotrons or linacs are required. Easy to use single-shot techniques are favored, which must be insensitive towards the EMP and associated stray light of all frequencies, taking into account the comparably low repetition rates and which, at the same time, allow for usage in very space-limited environments. Various measurement techniques are discussed here, and a space-saving method to determine several important properties of laser-generated electron bunches simultaneously is presented. The method is based on experimental results of electron-sensitive imaging plate stacks and combines these with Monte Carlo-type ray-tracing calculations, yielding a comprehensive picture of the properties of particle beams.

    abstract = "{Tapered plasma channels are considered for controlling dephasing of a beam with respect to a plasma wave driven by a weakly relativistic, short-pulse laser. Tapering allows for enhanced energy gain in a single laser-plasma accelerator stage. Expressions are derived for the taper, or longitudinal plasma density variation, required to maintain a beam at a constant phase in the longitudinal and/or transverse fields of the plasma wave. In a plasma channel, the phase velocities of the longitudinal and transverse fields differ and, hence, the required tapering differs. The length over which the tapered plasma density becomes singular is calculated. Linear plasma tapering as well as discontinuous plasma tapering, which moves beams to adjacent plasma wave buckets, is also considered. The energy gain of an accelerated electron in a tapered laser-plasma accelerator is calculated and the laser pulse length to optimize the energy gain is determined.}",
