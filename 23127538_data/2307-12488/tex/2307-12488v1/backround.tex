``In its current state, we believe that GPT-4 has a high proficiency in writing focused programs that only depend on existing public libraries, which favorably compares to the average software engineer’s ability."~\cite{bubeck2023sparks}.
``We also acknowledge that GPT-4 is not perfect in coding yet, as it sometimes produces syntactically invalid or semantically incorrect code, especially for longer or more complex programs.''

``GPT-4 also sometimes fails to understand or follow the instructions, or produces code that does not match the in- tended functionality or style. With this acknowledgment, we also point out that GPT-4 is able to improve its code by responding to both human feedback (e.g., by iteratively refining a plot in 3.2) and compiler / terminal errors (examples in Section 5.1)."
