\section{Conclusion}
This study unveils the strengths and limitations of LLMs when applied to security-oriented code analysis tasks. Our focused experiments on CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT shed light on the impact of literal and logic features on their performance, indicating the importance of considering the reliability of features in analyzed code. Users and researchers should be aware that LLM performance may be hindered when analyzing complex source code with insufficient information on variables, methods, and function names. We believe that our findings and analysis will provide valuable insights for future researchers in this domain, facilitating a deeper understanding of LLMs' potential and limitations in software security.
