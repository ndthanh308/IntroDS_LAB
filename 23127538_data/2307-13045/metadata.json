  "abstract": "We examine how different assumptions about the hadronic vacuum polarization, the $W$ boson mass, and the forward-backward asymmetry in $b$-quarks at the $Z$ pole can impact the precision electroweak fit. We study the implications for a kinetically mixed dark photon, addressing the complementarity of precision bounds and direct searches, particularly in the case where the dark photon can decay into the dark sector, and we consider implications for future Large Hadron Collider searches. We comment on cases where the precision effects of the dark photon may not be well-described by the oblique parameters.",
