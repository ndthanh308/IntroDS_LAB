A correct execution is achieved if the results produced are the same as would be produced by executing the program steps in order. For a multiprocessor computer, such a correct execution by each processor does not guarantee the correct execution of the entire program. Additional conditions are given which do guarantee that a computer correctly executes multiprocess programs.},

A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events. The use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems. The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.},

abstract = {Data structures are an important component of efficient and well-structured programs. In shared memory distributed computing, correct data structures are difficult to construct because concurrent accesses by different processes can conflict with one another. One simple approach is to use a global lock to restrict access to one process at a time. But this can severely affect performance. This talk will present a survey of some of the interesting techniques that have been developed to build efficient concurrent data structures. It will also discuss how we think concurrent data structures should be evaluated.},

journal={Distributed Computing},

abstract={This work consideres asynchronous shared memory systems in which any number of processes may crash. It identifies relaxations of fetch {\&} increment, queues, sets and stacks that can be non-blocking or wait-free implemented using only Read/Write operations, without Read-After-Write synchronization patterns. Set-linearizability, a generalization of linearizability designed to specify concurrent behaviors, is used to formally express these relaxations and precisely identify the subset of executions which preserve the original sequential behavior. The specifications allow for an item to be returned more than once by different operations, but only in case of concurrency; we call such a relaxation multiplicity. Hence, these definitions give rise to new notions and new objects where concurrency explicitly appears in the specification of the objects. As far as we know, this work is the first to provide relaxations of objects with consensus number two which can be implemented using only Read/Write registers.},

abstract = {A concurrent object is a data object shared by concurrent processes. Linearizability is a correctness condition for concurrent objects that exploits the semantics of abstract data types. It permits a high degree of concurrency, yet it permits programmers to specify and reason about concurrent objects using known techniques from the sequential domain. Linearizability provides the illusion that each operation applied by concurrent processes takes effect instantaneously at some point between its invocation and its response, implying that the meaning of a concurrent object's operations can be given by pre- and post-conditions. This paper defines linearizability, compares it to other correctness conditions, presents and demonstrates a method for proving the correctness of implementations, and shows how to reason about concurrent objects, given they are linearizable.},
