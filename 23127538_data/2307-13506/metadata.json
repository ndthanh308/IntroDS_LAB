  "abstract": "Epithelial morphogenesis, a signature problem of tissue biology and tissue mechanics, continues to inspire biologists and physicists alike. Many treatments focus on tissue fluidization, apical/basal ratio changes, or mechanical instabilities. In contrast to these approaches, shape-programmable materials, where the local lengths in the material change in a prescribed way, offer an appealing analogy. In this analogy, certain in-plane collective cell behaviors could also actively alter the local lengths in a tissue and therefore provide the ingredients necessary for shape programming. In this Letter we demonstrate that this is indeed the case for directed, active T1 rearrangements of cells. We determine the required shape programming parameters associated to tissue patches with both fixed numbers of rearrangements and patches at steady state between directed T1 events and counterbalancing randomly oriented ones using a simple free-boundary vertex model approach. Along the way we uncover a surprising connection between tissues with active T1 events and the central limit theorem, and through it, the physics of entropic springs.",
