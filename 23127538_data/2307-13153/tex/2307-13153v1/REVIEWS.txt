----- TEXT:
This paper studies the patrolling problem for an acute triangle by a single mobile agent. The goal is minimize the maximum idle time of any edge. The paper makes a very interesting and useful connection of this patrolling problem to an optimization problem solved by Fagnano is 1775 which sought to find the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It has been established that the orthic triangle is the solution to the Fagnano's problem, which provide periodic and cyclic trajectories. These concepts are also called Fagnano orbits or biliard trajectories. The billiard trajectories have been studied in different contexts.

Here the authors prove that the billiard trajectories (which were solutions to Fagnano's problem)  in fact provide optimal solutions to the patrolling problem of an acute triangle. Several results are established to support the proof of this connection. The paper is written pretty well and it seems to be an important contribution making an useful connection, which might spur more work in the future. The proof ideas read non-trivial and the topic itself is of interest to the SSS community. I recommend acceptance.

----- TEXT:
The authors investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent.
The Fagnano orbit is a well-known periodic trajectory in billiard systems, and it is the solution to the optimization problem which asks for the shortest such curve on acute triangles . In particular, the authors ask what are the patrolling strategies for the edges of an acute triangle that optimize standard frequency-related objectives, and they show that a family of Fagnano orbits are optimal solutions to the corresponding combinatorial optimization problems showing new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. Given a acute triangle, the orthic triangle is the solution of the Fagnano’s problem that asks for the inscribed triangle with minimum perimeter.
The author's goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. The main contributions of the paper are about the optimal 1-gap and 2-gap patrolling schedule of the acute triangle. Firstly the authors show that the optimal 1-gap cyclic patrolling schedule of an acute triangle is the orthic triangle, then they introduce the 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. The authors prove that there exists infinitely billiard-type optimal trajectories, the orthic one included. The authors also investigate the cost of sub-optimal trajectory resulting from a greedy algorithm.
The paper is well written. About the paper organization: all the statements of the theorems are presented in the section called “main contributions”, while dedicated sections contain the proofs. As a result, the reader needs to go back to Section 3.1 to reread the statement of the theorems. I understand the choice of authors might be beneficial to state all the main results in a condensed section, but I suggest evaluating giving an informal description of the contributions in Section 3.1 and then moving the statements of the theorems close to the proofs.
The patrolling agent, described in Section 8, and patrolling the triangle in the greedy algorithm is rather abstract and there are very few details about its capabilities in the paper. I would expect more details about its behavior. This could be done relating to one of the well-established models described in [1]. The agent is a primitive patroller that can remember the current and previously visited edges and it can compute (move along) the projection of its current position to any other edge. As the agent has some memory, I suggest removing the adjective “oblivious” while referring to it in the abstract of the paper. Moreover, I suggest motivating the choice of robot capabilities because, in Section 3.1, the authors state that a mobile agent whose task is to 1-gap optimally patrol a triangle needs to be able to compute the base points of the triangle’s altitudes. Therefore, a question that may arise is why do not endow an agent with such capabilities.

SCORE: 0 (borderline paper)
----- TEXT:
The paper studies the patrolling of triangles by a single agent. On this regard it shows a connection between the Fagnano orbits and the optimal patroling scheme of a single agent for a triangle. An edge is visited when the agent touches a point of the edge.

They introduce a 2-gap patrolling problem, in which the agent has to minimize the visitation time of three consecutive visit of an object. They show that 2-gap optimal visiting schedule are Fagnano orbits of a triangle and that 1-gap optimal visit schedule are orthic triangles.

They show that a primitive agent can compute an approximation of the 1-gap optimal visiting schedule.

Comment:

The paper could benefit from a section that explains better its contributions.
The writing is overall good but it uses terms that are not defined, as example what computationally primitive means for an agent?
It seems that the word primitive is never defined.

Another weak point is that the paper is heavily based on geometry but I fail to see ideas pertaining the distributed computing community. According to the authors the result do translate to a single agent, that is centralized setting, but also in this case the explanation of the computational capabilities of such an agent is lacking (again what does primitive means, what is the model of this agent?)
