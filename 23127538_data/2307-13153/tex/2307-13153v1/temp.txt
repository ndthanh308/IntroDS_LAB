----- TEXT:
The paper is well written. About the paper organization: all the statements of the theorems are presented in the section called “main contributions”, while dedicated sections contain the proofs. As a result, the reader needs to go back to Section 3.1 to reread the statement of the theorems. I understand the choice of authors might be beneficial to state all the main results in a condensed section, but I suggest evaluating giving an informal description of the contributions in Section 3.1 and then moving the statements of the theorems close to the proofs.

The patrolling agent, described in Section 8, and patrolling the triangle in the greedy algorithm is rather abstract and there are very few details about its capabilities in the paper. I would expect more details about its behavior. This could be done relating to one of the well-established models described in [1]. The agent is a primitive patroller that can remember the current and previously visited edges and it can compute (move along) the projection of its current position to any other edge. As the agent has some memory, I suggest removing the adjective “oblivious” while referring to it in the abstract of the paper. Moreover, I suggest motivating the choice of robot capabilities because, in Section 3.1, the authors state that a mobile agent whose task is to 1-gap optimally patrol a triangle needs to be able to compute the base points of the triangle’s altitudes. Therefore, a question that may arise is why do not endow an agent with such capabilities.

Specific comments


- Page 8, Section 6: I suggest highlighting the definition of the “2k-limited patrolling” problem that is currently in between the lines.

- Page 9: The paragraph before Lemma 7: the word “trajectories” is misspelled.
- Page 13  three lines from the end of Section 9: the word “ratio” is misspelled.

The writing is overall good but it uses terms that are not defined, as example what computationally primitive means for an agent?
It seems that the word primitive is never defined.
