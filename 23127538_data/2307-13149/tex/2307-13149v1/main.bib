	abstract = {We propose a tensorial sparse symbolic regression method to directly establish explicit algebraic tensorial macroscopic constitutive models for elastic solids under large deformation from data obtained at the mesoscale. Unlike ``black-box'' data-driven models such as artificial neural networks, the model established with our proposed method is a ``white-box'' polynomial of tensors, which is important for gaining insights into the deformation nature from multi-scale calculations and modeling. The proposed method first generates a massive number of candidate basis tensor terms and then combines them linearly with fitting coefficients, only a small set of which are non-zero. In this way, the established constitutive models are concise and precise. An innovative hybrid feature selection and regression technique (a combination of high-dimensional Lasso, teaching--learning-based optimization and recursive feature elimination) is proposed to overcome the issues of high correlation and multicollinearity of the terms in this sparse regression problem. Four benchmark tests are introduced to verify that the proposed method established correct models directly from data generated by the benchmarks. A rate-type hypoelastic model is also established with the data generated by the not rate-type benchmarks. At last, an example of constitutive modeling for particle-reinforced composites is introduced to illustrate the ability of the proposed method to build explicit tensorial macroscopic models from data generated by mesoscopic calculations, demonstrating its potential for widespread application in multi-scale simulations of hierarchical materials.},

The proposed algorithm is implemented into a finite-element code and is shown to be capable of producing accurate results even for large incremental steps.

	abstract = {The microstructure of dislocations can be accessed by the total density of dislocations or the density of geometrically necessary dislocations (GND). The total dislocation density determines the flow strength of a crystal, which, in the case of high dislocation contents, is a quantity very difficult to measure accurately. On the other hand, related to crystal rotations, the GND densities are conveniently measured from electron diffraction experiments or calculated via simulations. Here, a novel and modern approach is proposed to understand the microstructures of dislocations based on deep learning, which estimates the total density of dislocations from a given density of GND distributions. In this method, the convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) are applied to extract the hidden information in the GND distribution maps to understand the microstructures of dislocations. It is demonstrated that the pre-trained ConvNets can be used to predict the distribution of total dislocation density from a small GND density map. Moreover, this technique is further developed to post-process real EBSD images for α-Fe to estimate the average total dislocation density, which corresponds to stress increments from a Taylor hardening assumption that is in good agreement with experimental values. Compared with previous methods involving much effort to track individual dislocations or other quantities, the present machine learning method is quick and convenient to use.},

	abstract = {This research aims to propose a machine learning (ML)-based constitutive model to predict elastoplastic behavior for J2-plasticity. An artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed to replace the nonlinear stress-integration scheme conducted in the conventional theoretical constitutive model under isotropic hardening and associated flow rule. The training dataset required for the ANN Model was numerically generated based on the conventional return mapping scheme in the principal stress space. The training has been effectively carried out with one element simulation along all the possible plastic loading paths for problem independent training. A conventional theoretical method is used for the unloading procedure. Therefore, ANN is selectively utilized only for nonlinear plastic loading while keeping linear elastic loading and the unloading with a physics-based model. After one element training, the ML-based constitutive model was implemented in Abaqus User MATerial (UMAT) and its performance was verified. For this purpose, one element and tensile test simulations were applied to examine the accuracy of the ANN-based model. Also, for fully nonlinear strain-paths, a circular cup drawing simulation was applied to predict the cup profiles which was compared with that to the conventional J2 plasticity. It was concluded that the simulation results predicted from the ANN-based model show good agreement with those from the conventional J2-based constitutive model. Also, according to simulation time, the ANN-based model shows an advantage in computational efficiency.},

	abstract = {While crack nucleation and propagation in the brittle or quasi-brittle regime can be predicted via variational or material-force-based phase field fracture models, these models often assume that the underlying elastic response of the material is not size-dependent. Yet, a length scale parameter must be introduced to these models to enable sharp cracks properly represented by a regularized implicit function. However, many materials with internal microstructures that contain surface tension, micro-cracks, micro-fracture, inclusion, cavity or those of particulate nature often exhibit size-dependent behaviors in both the path-independent and path-dependent regimes. This paper is intended to introduce a unified treatment that captures the size effect of the materials in both elastic and damaged states. By introducing a cohesive micropolar phase field fracture theory, along with the computational model and validation exercises, we explore the interacting size-dependent elastic deformation and fracture mechanisms exhibits in materials of complex microstructures. To achieve this goal, we introduce the distinctive degradation functions of the force-stress--strain and couple-stress-micro-rotation energy-conjugated pairs for a given regularization profile such that the macroscopic size-dependent responses of the micropolar continua are insensitive to the length scale parameter of the regularized interface. Then, we apply the variational principle to derive governing equations from the micropolar stored energy and dissipative functionals. Numerical examples are introduced to demonstrate the proper way to identify material parameters and the capacity of the new formulation to simulate complex crack patterns in the quasi-static regime.},
