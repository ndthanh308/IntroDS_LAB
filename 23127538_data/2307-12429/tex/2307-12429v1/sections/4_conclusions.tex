% To address this gap, we present SwIPE, a novel approach that utilizes implicit patch embeddings to achieve efficient and robust medical image segmentation. SwIPE directly models object shapes and adopts continuous representations, enabling accurate segmentation while avoiding the limitations of traditional approaches.

SwIPE represents a notable departure from conventional discrete segmentation approaches and directly models object shapes instead of pixels and utilizes continuous rather than discrete representations. 
By adopting both patch and image embeddings, our approach enables accurate local geometric descriptions and improved shape coherence.
% Our approach also adopts both patch and image embeddings to enable the efficient representation of local object geometry and appearance.
% Our approach is based on the use of implicit patch embeddings that enable the representation of local object geometry and appearance in an expressive and memory-efficient manner. 
% SwIPE is designed to work with 
% %a variety of 
% different medical image modalities and has been
% %extensively 
% well evaluated on several benchmark datasets. 
Experimental results show the superiority of SwIPE over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. 
The use of local INRs represents a new direction for medical image segmentation, and we hope to inspire further research in this direction.
