  "abstract": "We study the Artinian reduction $A$ of a configuration of points $X \\subset {\\mathbb P}^n $, and the relation of the geometry of $X$ to Lefschetz properties of $A$. Migliore initiated the study of this connection, with a particular focus on the Hilbert function of $A$, and further results appear in work of Migliore--Miró-Roig--Nagel. Our specific focus is on Betti tables rather than Hilbert functions, and we prove that a certain type of Betti table forces the failure of the Weak Lefschetz Property (WLP). The corresponding Artinian algebras are typically not level, and the failure of WLP in these cases is not detected in terms of the Hilbert function.",
