Here, we expand the definition to hypersurfaces of any dimension and, using constructions which appeal to algebra, geometry, representation theory, and computation, we obtain a coarse but complete classification of unexpected hypersurfaces. In particular, we determine each (n,d,m) for which there is some finite set of points Z⊂Pn with an unexpected hypersurface of degree d in Pn having a general point P of multiplicity m. Our constructions also give new insight into the interesting question of where to look for such Z. Recent work of Di Marca, Malara, and Oneto [10] and of Bauer, Malara, Szemberg, and Szpond [5] gives new results and examples in P2 and P3. We obtain our main results using a new construction of unexpected hypersurfaces involving cones. This method applies in Pn for n≥3 and gives a broad range of examples, which we link to certain failures of the Weak Lefschetz Property. We also give constructions using root systems, both in P2 and Pn for n≥3. Finally, we explain an observation of [5], showing that the unexpected curves of [7] are in some sense dual to their tangent cones at their singular point.},

We show that the same is true for the Artinian reduction of reduced, level sets of points in projective 3-space. Our main goal is to begin an understanding of how the geometry of a set of points can prevent its Artinian reduction from having WLPWLP{\textbackslash}text\{WLP\}, which in itself is a very algebraic notion. More precisely, we produce level sets of points whose Artinian reductions have socle types 3 and 4 and arbitrary socle degree ≥ 12 (in the worst case), but fail to have WLPWLP{\textbackslash}text\{WLP\}. We also produce a level set of points whose Artinian reduction fails to have unimodal Hilbert function; our example is based on Zanello's example. Finally, we show that a level set of points can have Artinian reduction that has WLPWLP{\textbackslash}text\{WLP\} but fails to have the Strong Lefschetz Property. While our constructions are all based on basic double GGG-linkage, the implementations use very different methods.},

As a first step towards a new theory, we show that rational curves play a similar role in a special case of a generalized problem, which asks how many conditions are imposed by a general union of fat points on linear subsystems defined by imposed base points. Moreover, motivated by work of Di Gennaro, Ilardi and Vallès and of Faenzi and Vallès, we relate our results to the failure of a strong Lefschetz property, and we give a Lefschetz-like criterion for Terao’s conjecture on the freeness of line arrangements.},

The weak Lefschetz property (WLP) has been much studied for AG rings; it is easy to show that an AG ring with non-unimodal \$H\$-vector fails to have WLP. In codimension \$c=3\$ it is conjectured that all AG rings have WLP. For \$c=4\$, Gondim showed that WLP always holds for \$r {\textbackslash}le 4\$ and gives a family where WLP fails for any \$r {\textbackslash}ge 7\$, building on an earlier example of Ikeda of failure of WLP for \$r=5\$. In this note we study the minimal free resolution of \$A\$ and relation to Lefschetz properties (both weak and strong) and Jordan type for \$c=4\$ and \$r {\textbackslash}le 6\$.},

Here, for any \$4 {\textbackslash}leq a {\textbackslash}leq b\$, we construct nongrid nondegenerate \$(a,b)\$-geproci sets in a systematic way. We also show that the only such example with \$a=3\$ is a \$(3,4)\$-geproci set coming from the \$D\_4\$ root system, and we describe the \$D\_4\$ configuration in detail. We also consider the question of the equivalence (in various senses) of geproci sets, as well as which sets occur over the reals, and which cannot. We identify several additional examples of geproci sets with interesting properties. We also explore the relation between unexpected cones and geproci sets and introduce the notion of \$d\$-Weddle schemes arising from special projections of finite sets of points. This work initiates the exploration of new perspectives on classical areas of geometry. We formulate and discuss a range of open problems in the final chapter.},

Curiously, they turn out to be exactly those (characterized by Wiebe in [A. Wiebe, The Lefschetz property for componentwise linear ideals and Gotzmann ideals, Comm. Algebra 32 (12) (2004) 4601–4611]) whose Gotzmann ideals have the WLP. This implies that, if a Gotzmann ideal has the WLP, then all algebras with the same Hilbert function (and hence lower Betti numbers) have the WLP as well. However, we will answer in the negative, even in the case of level algebras, the most natural question that one might ask after reading the previous sentence: If A is an artinian algebra enjoying the WLP, do all artinian algebras with the same Hilbert function as A and Betti numbers lower than those of A have the WLP as well? Also, as a consequence of our result, we have another (simpler) proof of the fact that all codimension 2 algebras enjoy the WLP (this fact was first proven in [T. Harima, J. Migliore, U. Nagel, J. Watanabe, The weak and strong Lefschetz properties for Artinian K-algebras, J. Algebra 262 (2003) 99–126], where it was shown that even the Strong Lefschetz Property holds).},
