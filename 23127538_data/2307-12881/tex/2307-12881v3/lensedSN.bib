These improvements offer the opportunity to discover up to three orders of magnitude more galaxy-galaxy strong lenses than are currently known. In this work we forecast the number of lenses discoverable in forthcoming surveys and simulate their properties. We generate a population of statistically realistic strong lenses and simulate observations of this population for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Euclid surveys. We verify our model against the galaxy-scale lens search of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), predicting 250 discoverable lenses compared to 220 found by Gavazzi et al (2014). The predicted Einstein radius distribution is also remarkably similar to that found by Sonnenfeld et al (2013). For future surveys we find that, assuming Poisson limited lens galaxy subtraction, searches in DES, LSST and Euclid datasets should discover 2400, 120000, and 170000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses respectively. Finders using blue minus red (g-i) difference imaging for lens subtraction can discover 1300 and 62000 lenses in DES and LSST. The uncertainties on the model are dominated by the high redshift source population which typically gives fractional errors on the discoverable lens number at the tens of percent level. We find that doubling the signal-to-noise ratio required for a lens to be detectable, approximately halves the number of detectable lenses in each survey, indicating the importance of understanding the selection function and sensitivity of future lens finders in interpreting strong lens statistics. We make our population forecasting and simulated observation codes publicly available so that the selection function of strong lens finders can easily be calibrated.}, note={we}, number={1}, journal={\apj}, author={Collett, Thomas E.}, year={2015}, month={Sep}, pages={20} }

    abstract = "{Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) can be detected as multiply imaged or highly magnified transients. In order to compare the performances of these two observational strategies, we calculate expected discovery rates as a function of survey depth in five grizy filters and for different classes of SNe (types Ia, IIP, IIL, Ibc, and IIn). We find that detections via magnification is the only effective strategy for relatively shallow pre-LSST (Large Synoptic Sky Survey) surveys. For survey depths about the LSST capacity, both strategies yield comparable numbers of lensed SNe. SN samples from the two methods are to a large extent independent and combining them increases detection rates by about 50 per cent. While the number of lensed SNe detectable via magnification saturates at the limiting magnitudes of LSST, detection rates of multiply imaged SN still go up drastically at increasing survey depth. Comparing potential discovery spaces, we find that lensed SNe found via image multiplicity exhibit longer time delays and larger image separations making them more suitable for cosmological constraints than their counterparts found via magnification. We provide useful fitting functions approximating the computed discovery rates for different SN classes and detection methods. We find that the Zwicky Transient Factory will find about two type Ia and four core-collapse lensed SNe per year at a limiting magnitude of 20.6 in the r band. Applying a hybrid method which combines searching for highly magnified or multiply imaged transients, we find that LSST will detect 89 type Ia and 254 core-collapse lensed SNe per year. In all cases, lensed core-collapsed SNe will be dominated by type IIn SNe contributing to 80 per cent of the total counts, although this prediction relies quite strongly on the adopted spectral templates for this class of SNe. Revisiting the case of the lensed SN iPTF16geu, we find that it is consistent within the 2σ contours of predicted redshifts and magnifications for the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory survey.}",

title = {The SED Machine: A Robotic Spectrograph for Fast Transient Classification},
journal = {\pasp},
abstract = {Current time domain facilities are finding several hundreds of transient astronomical events a year. The discovery rate is expected to increase in the future as soon as new surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Large Synoptic Sky Survey (LSST) come online. Presently, the rate at which transients are classified is approximately one order or magnitude lower than the discovery rate, leading to an increasing “follow-up drought”. Existing telescopes with moderate aperture can help address this deficit when equipped with spectrographs optimized for spectral classification. Here, we provide an overview of the design, operations and first results of the Spectral Energy Distribution Machine (SEDM), operating on the Palomar 60-inch telescope (P60). The instrument is optimized for classification and high observing efficiency. It combines a low-resolution (R ∼ 100) integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph with “Rainbow Camera” (RC), a multi-band field acquisition camera which also serves as multi-band (ugri) photometer. The SEDM was commissioned during the operation of the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) and has already lived up to its promise. The success of the SEDM demonstrates the value of spectrographs optimized for spectral classification.}

abstract = {We present lenstronomy, a multi-purpose open-source gravitational lens modelling pythonpackage. lenstronomyis able to reconstruct the lens mass and surface brightness distributions of strong lensing systems using forward modelling. lenstronomysupports a wide range of analytic lens and light models in arbitrary combination. The software is also able to reconstruct complex extended sources (Birrer et. al 2015) as well as being able to model point sources. We designed lenstronomto be stable, flexible and numerically accurate, with a clear user interface that could be deployed across different platforms. Throughout its development, we have actively used lenstronomyto make several measurements including deriving constraints on dark matter properties in strong lenses, measuring the expansion history of the universe with time-delay cosmography, measuring cosmic shear with Einstein rings and decomposing quasar and host galaxy light. The software is distributed under the MIT license. The documentation, starter guide, example notebooks, source code and installation guidelines can be found at https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io.}

abstract = {We study the optical light curve (LC) relations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) for their use in cosmology using high-quality photometry published by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP-I). We revisit the classical luminosity decline rate (Δm15) relation and the Lira relation, as well as investigate the time evolution of the (B − V) color and B(B − V), which serves as the basis of the color–stretch relation and Color–MAgnitude Intercept Calibrations (CMAGIC). Our analysis is based on explosion and radiation transport simulations for spherically symmetric delayed-detonation models (DDT) producing normal-bright and subluminous SNe Ia. Empirical LC relations can be understood as having the same physical underpinnings, i.e., opacities, ionization balances in the photosphere, and radioactive energy deposition changing with time from below to above the photosphere. Some three to four weeks past maximum, the photosphere recedes to 56Ni-rich layers of similar density structure, leading to a similar color evolution. An important secondary parameter is the central density ρc of the WD because at higher densities, more electron-capture elements are produced at the expense of 56Ni production. This results in a Δm15 spread of 0.1 mag in normal-bright and 0.7 mag in subluminous SNe Ia and ≈0.2 mag in the Lira relation. We show why color–magnitude diagrams emphasize the transition between physical regimes and enable the construction of templates that depend mostly on Δm15 with little dispersion in both the CSP-I sample and our DDT models. This allows intrinsic SNIa variations to be separated from the interstellar reddening characterized by E(B − V) and RB. Invoking different scenarios causes a wide spread in empirical relations, which may suggest one dominant scenario.}

journal = {\apj},
abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data and Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) near-infrared ground-based images for the final sample of 56 candidate galaxy-scale lenses uncovered in the CFHT Legacy Survey as part of the Strong Lensing in the Legacy Survey project. The new images are used to perform lens modeling, measure surface photometry, and estimate stellar masses of the deflector early-type galaxies (ETGs). Lens modeling is performed on the HST images (or CFHT when HST is not available) by fitting the spatially extended light distribution of the lensed features assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile and by reconstructing the intrinsic source light distribution on a pixelized grid. Based on the analysis of systematic uncertainties and comparison with inference based on different methods, we estimate that our Einstein radii are accurate to ∼3\%. HST imaging provides a much higher success rate in confirming gravitational lenses and measuring their Einstein radii than CFHT imaging does. Lens modeling with ground-based images, however, when successful, yields Einstein radius measurements that are competitive with space-based images. Information from the lens models is used together with spectroscopic information from companion Paper IV to classify the systems, resulting in a final sample of 39 confirmed (grade A) lenses and 17 promising candidates (grade B,C). This represents an increase of half an order of magnitude in sample size with respect to the sample of confirmed lenses studied in Papers I and II. The Einstein radii of the confirmed lenses in our sample span the range 5–15 kpc and are typically larger than those of other surveys, probing the mass in regions where the dark matter contribution is more important. Stellar masses are in the range 1011–1012 M☉, covering the range of massive ETGs. The redshifts of the main deflector span a range 0.3 ⩽ zd ⩽ 0.8, which nicely complements low-redshift samples like the Sloan Lens ACS survey and thus provides an excellent sample for the study of the cosmic evolution of the mass distribution of ETGs over the second half of the history of the universe.}

abstract = {We present a hierarchical Bayesian determination of the velocity-dispersion function of approximately 430,000 massive luminous red galaxies observed at relatively low spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ∼ 3–5 per 69 km s−1) by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. We marginalize over spectroscopic redshift errors, and use the full velocity-dispersion likelihood function for each galaxy to make a self-consistent determination of the velocity-dispersion distribution parameters as a function of absolute magnitude and redshift, correcting as well for the effects of broadband magnitude errors on our binning. Parameterizing the distribution at each point in the luminosity–redshift plane with a log-normal form, we detect significant evolution in the width of the distribution toward higher intrinsic scatter at higher redshifts. Using a subset of deep re-observations of BOSS galaxies, we demonstrate that our distribution-parameter estimates are unbiased regardless of spectroscopic S/N. We also show through simulation that our method introduces no systematic parameter bias with redshift. We highlight the advantage of the hierarchical Bayesian method over frequentist “stacking” of spectra, and illustrate how our measured distribution parameters can be adopted as informative priors for velocity-dispersion measurements from individual noisy spectra.}

title = {A Robust Determination of the Time Delay in 0957+561A, B and a Measurement of the Global Value of Hubble's Constant},
journal = {\apj},
abstract = {Continued photometric monitoring of the gravitational lens system 0957+561A, B in the g and r bands with the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5 m telescope during 1996 shows a sharp g-band event in the trailing (B) image light curve at the precise time predicted in an earlier paper. The prediction was based on the observation of the event during 1995 in the leading (A) image and on a differential time delay of 415 days. This success confirms the so-called short delay, and the absence of any such feature at a delay near 540 days rejects the “long delay” for this system, thus resolving a long-standing controversy. A series of statistical analyses of our light-curve data yield a best-fit delay of 417 ± 3 days (95\% confidence interval) and demonstrate that this result is quite robust against variations in the analysis technique, data subsamples, and assumed parametric relationship of the two light curves.

Recent improvements in the modeling of the lens system (consisting of a galaxy plus a galaxy cluster) allow us to derive a value of the global value (at z = 0.36) of Hubble's constant H0 using Refsdal's method, a simple and direct (single-step) distance determination based on experimentally verified and securely understood physics and geometry. The result is H0 = 64 ± 13 km s-1 Mpc-1 (for Ω = 1), where this 95\% confidence interval is dominantly due to remaining lens model uncertainties. However, it is reassuring that available observations of the lensing mass distribution overconstrain the model and thus provide an internal consistency check on its validity. We argue that this determination of the extragalactic distance scale (10\% accurate at 1sig) is now of comparable quality, in terms of both statistical and systematic uncertainties, to those based on more conventional techniques.

Finally, we briefly discuss the prospects for improved H0 determinations using gravitational lenses, and some other possible implications and uses of the 0957+561A, B light curves.}

A preliminary reduction of data taken from 1995 November to 1996 June gives component C leading component B by 23.7 ± 3.4 days and components A1 and A2 by 9.4 days. A range of models has been fitted to the image positions, none of which gives an adequate fit. The best-fitting and most physically plausible of these, taking the lensing galaxy and the associated group of galaxies to be singular isothermal spheres, gives a Hubble constant of 42 km s-1 Mpc-1 for Ω = 1, with an observational uncertainty of 14\%, as computed from the B - C time delay measurement. Taking the lensing galaxy to have an approximately E5 isothermal mass distribution yields H0 = 64 km s-1 Mpc-1, while taking the galaxy to be a point mass gives H0 = 84 km s-1 Mpc-1. The former gives a particularly bad fit to the position of the lensing galaxy, while the latter is inconsistent with measurements of nearby galaxy rotation curves. Constraints on these and other possible models are expected to improve with planned Hubble Space Telescope observations.}

journal = {\apj Letters},
abstract = {We present predictions for time delays between multiple images of the gravitationally lensed supernova, iPTF16geu, which was recently discovered from the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). As the supernova is of Type Ia where the intrinsic luminosity is usually well known, accurately measured time delays of the multiple images could provide tight constraints on the Hubble constant. According to our lens mass models constrained by the Hubble Space Telescope F814W image, we expect the maximum relative time delay to be less than a day, which is consistent with the maximum of 100 hr reported by Goobar et al. but places a stringent upper limit. Furthermore, the fluxes of most of the supernova images depart from expected values suggesting that they are affected by microlensing. The microlensing timescales are small enough that they may pose significant problems to measure the time delays reliably. Our lensing rate calculation indicates that the occurrence of a lensed SN in iPTF is likely. However, the observed total magnification of iPTF16geu is larger than expected, given its redshift. This may be a further indication of ongoing microlensing in this system.}

    abstract = "{Cadenced optical imaging surveys in the next decade will be capable of detecting time-varying galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses in large numbers, increasing the size of the statistically well-defined samples of multiply imaged quasars by two orders of magnitude, and discovering the first strongly lensed supernovae. We carry out a detailed calculation of the likely yields of several planned surveys, using realistic distributions for the lens and source properties and taking magnification bias and image configuration detectability into account. We find that upcoming wide-field synoptic surveys should detect several thousand lensed quasars. In particular, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) should find more than some 8000 lensed quasars, some 3000 of which will have well-measured time delays. The LSST should also find some 130 lensed supernovae during the 10-yr survey duration, which is compared with ∼15 lensed supernovae predicted to be found by a deep, space-based supernova survey done by the Joint Dark Energy Mission. We compute the quad fraction in each survey, predicting it to be ∼15 per cent for the lensed quasars and ∼30 per cent for the lensed supernovae. Generating a mock catalogue of around 1500 well-observed double-image lenses, as could be derived from the LSST survey, we compute the available precision on the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation parameters for the time-delay distance experiment (assuming priors from Planck): the predicted marginalized 68 per cent confidence intervals are σ(w0) = 0.15, σ(wa) = 0.41 and σ(h) = 0.017. While this is encouraging in the sense that these uncertainties are only 50 per cent larger than those predicted for a space-based Type Ia supernova sample, we show how the dark energy figure of merit degrades with decreasing knowledge of the lens mass distribution.}",
