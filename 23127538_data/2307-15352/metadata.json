  "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce Wick's quantization on groups and discuss its links with Kohn-Nirenberg's. By  quantization, we mean an operation that associates an operator to a symbol. The notion of symbols for both quantizations  is based on representation theory via the group Fourier transform  and the  Plancherel theorem. As an application, we give a simple proof of Garding inequalities for three globally symbolic pseudo-differential calculi on groups.",
