abstract = {Smart cities are an innovate concept for managing urban cities to enhance sustainability and increase quality of life for citizens. Although urban water infrastructure (UWI) performs important functions in a city (e.g., supply of drinking water), information and communication technologies (ICT) and system-wide management of network-based UWI are not yet widely deployed. Therefore, this review summarises first both existing and potential applications related to network-based UWI, characterised by different spatial and temporal resolution of measurement and control data. Second, a comprehensive analysis of ICT is provided, which is extended with exemplary applications in the field. The analysis reveals that a coordination between intended application and usable communication technology is required to realise an efficient monitoring and control network in the field of UWI networks. To overcome this limitation, a detailed framework is developed, which can be used by researcher, network operators, and stakeholder to identify suitable communication technologies for different UWI applications or to determine possible applications for an existing ICT system. Following, the applicability of the framework is demonstrated by selected examples. As the framework also indicates, an integrated approach towards smart water cities requires the combination of different communication technologies to satisfy all specifications.}

abstract = {Global warming is one of the major consequences of the human activities where the overuse of fossil fuels as energy resources caused the increase in the concentration of the greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as CO2, CH4, N2O, and water vapor, in the atmosphere causing the increase in the average surface temperature of the earth. This article reviews the driving forces of global warming and highlights the major contributors to this phenomenon and presents some of the mitigation techniques. Water vapor is responsible for two-third of the global warming; however, CO2 is considered as the controlling factor of the global warming. In other words, if the concentration of CO2 did not increase, global warming would not have happened. Scientists claim that doubling or halving the CO2 in the atmosphere causes the change in the average surface temperature of the earth by +3.8 °C or −3.6 °C, respectively. However, this amount of change depends on the change in the humidity of the air which in return depends on the air's temperature. Conversely, even though the other GHGs such as CH4 and N2O have stronger ability to absorb the radiation, their contribution in the global warming is insignificant because of their low concentration in the atmosphere compared with CO2. The adoption of the mitigation and adaptation strategies at the same time is the most effective economic and technical solution for the global warming issue. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: 13–21, 2019},

abstract = {Abstract Global warming is expected to change the regime of extreme precipitation. Physical laws translate increasing atmospheric heat into increasing atmospheric water content that drives precipitation changes. Within the literature, general agreement is that extreme precipitation is changing, yet different assessment methods, data sets, and study periods may result in different patterns and rates of change. Here we perform a global analysis of 8,730 daily precipitation records focusing on the 1964–2013 period when the global warming accelerates. We introduce a novel analysis of the N largest extremes in records having N complete years within the study period. Based on these extremes, which represent more accurately heavy precipitation than annual maxima, we form time series of their annual frequency and mean annual magnitude. The analysis offers new insights and reveals (1) global and zonal increasing trends in the frequency of extremes that are highly unlikely under the assumption of stationarity and (2) magnitude changes that are not as evident. Frequency changes reveal a coherent spatial pattern with increasing trends being detected in large parts of Eurasia, North Australia, and the Midwestern United States. Globally, over the last decade of the studied period we find 7\% more extreme events than the expected number. Finally, we report that changes in magnitude are not in general correlated with changes in frequency.},

abstract = {This article reviews current drought effects on environmental systems. It stresses the need for considering environmental drought as a relevant type to be included in drought classifications. Here we illustrate that drought has complex environmental effects and affects many different systems (e.g., soils, air, vegetation, and forests, aquatic systems and wildlife). Droughts can affect the quality, structure, and diversity of these systems. However, we find that most environmental systems show strong resistance and resilience to drought events, and the effects of drought are usually temporary. Structural effects of environmental droughts tend to only occur in areas that are perturbed or in communities near their distribution limits. There are few long-term experimental studies that quantify possible trends in drought effects on environmental systems. Nevertheless, existing studies of forests that are based on tree-ring chronologies or forest inventories indicate increased drought-related effects on environmental systems. Future climate change scenarios suggest increased drought severity worldwide, which could alter the vulnerability of different environmental systems and increase the number of structural drought effects.}

We consider continuous consensus functions of the initial state of the network agents. Under mild smoothness assumptions, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions characterizing any algorithm that asymptotically achieves consensus. This characterization is the building block to obtain various design results for networks with weighted, directed interconnection topologies. We first identify a class of smooth functions for which one can synthesize in a systematic way distributed algorithms that achieve consensus. We apply this result to the family of weighted power mean functions, and characterize the exponential convergence properties of the resulting algorithms. We establish the validity of these results for scenarios with switching interconnection topologies. Finally, we conclude with two discontinuous distributed algorithms that achieve, respectively, max and min consensus in finite time.}

Given an approximate value of the average of the initial condition of the network state and some intermediate values of the network state when performing a Laplacian-based average consensus, the estimation of the Laplacian eigenvalues is obtained by solving the factorization of the averaging matrix. For this purpose, in contrast to the state of the art, we formulate a convex optimization problem that is solved in a distributed way by means of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The main variables in the optimization problem are the coefficients of a polynomial whose roots are precisely the inverse of the distinct nonzero Laplacian eigenvalues. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by means of simulation results.}

abstract="This paper considers the problem of computing the diameter D and the girth g of an n-node network in the CONGEST distributed model. In this model, in each synchronous round, each vertex can transmit a different short (say, O(logn) bits) message to each of its neighbors. We present a distributed algorithm that computes the diameter of the network in O(n) rounds. We also present two distributed approximation algorithms. The first computes a 2/3 multiplicative approximation of the diameter in {\$}O(D{\backslash}sqrt n {\backslash}log n){\$}rounds. The second computes a 2{\thinspace}−{\thinspace}1/g multiplicative approximation of the girth in {\$}O(D+{\backslash}sqrt{\{}gn{\}}{\backslash}log n){\$}rounds. Recently, Frischknecht, Holzer and Wattenhofer [11] considered these problems in the CONGEST model but from the perspective of lower bounds. They showed an {\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}{\backslash}Omega{\}}(n){\$}rounds lower bound for exact diameter computation. For diameter approximation, they showed a lower bound of {\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}{\backslash}Omega{\}}({\backslash}sqrt n){\$}rounds for getting a multiplicative approximation of . Both lower bounds hold for networks with constant diameter. For girth approximation, they showed a lower bound of {\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}{\backslash}Omega{\}}({\backslash}sqrt n){\$}rounds for getting a multiplicative approximation of on a network with constant girth. Our exact algorithm for computing the diameter matches their lower bound. Our diameter and girth approximation algorithms almost match their lower bounds for constant diameter and for constant girth.",

Today, unmanned aerial vehicle platforms are especially used in reconnaissance, surveillance and communications areas. In this study, in order to achieve continuous long-range communication relay infrastructure, artificial potential field based path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is discussed. A novel dynamic approach to relay-chain concept is proposed to maintain the communication between vehicles. Besides dynamically keeping vehicles in range and appropriate position to maintain communication relay, artificial potential field based path planning also provides collision avoidance system. The performance of the proposed system is measured by applying a simulation under the Matlab Simulink and Network Simulator environment. Artificial potential field based flight patterns are generated in Matlab, and performance
        of the communication between vehicles is measured in Network Simulation environment. Finally the simulation results show that an airborne communication relay can be established autonomously by using artificial potential filed based autonomous path planning approach. Continues state communication is provided by obtaining a resistant communication relay which depends on artificial potential field based positioning algorithm.},

	ABSTRACT = {In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been considered an ideal relay platform for enhancing the communication between ground agents, because they fly at high altitudes and are easy to deploy with strong adaptabilities. Their maneuvering allows them to adjust their location to optimize the performance of links, which brings out the relay UAV autonomous mobility control problem. This work addressed the problem in a novel scene with mobile agents and completely unknown wireless channel properties, using only online measured information of received signal strength (RSS) and agent positions. The problem is challenging because of the unknown and dynamic radio frequency (RF) environment cause by agents and UAV maneuvering. We present a framework for both end-to-end communication and multi-agent-inter communication applications, and focus on proposing: (1) least square estimation-based channel approximation with consideration of environment effects and, (2) gradient-based optimal relay position seeking. Simulation results show that considering the environmental effects on channel parameters is meaningful and beneficial in using UAV as relays for the communication of multiple ground agents, and validate that the proposed algorithms optimizes the network performance by controlling the heading of the UAV.}

The communication channel quality prediction between nodes is of primary concern to find the optimal relay node positions while considering the uncertain and dynamic nature of environments. To this end, the learning-based or the distance model-based method is used for the channel prediction depending on the mobility of the communication nodes of interest. The global message connectivity and the worst case connectivity are introduced as the communication performance metric of networked agents. The optimal relay positions are found by maximizing the performance with respect to the relay positions through a heuristic optimization technique. This algorithm outperforms a recently-developed relay positioning algorithm in the simulations. The indoor experiments are conducted to show that the proposed approach using mobile relays improves the communication performance of the complex network significantly with the accurate channel prediction."

abstract = {Abstract This paper describes a distributed coordination scheme with local information exchange for multiple vehicle systems. We introduce second-order consensus protocols that take into account motions of the information states and their derivatives, extending first-order protocols from the literature. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which consensus can be reached in the context of unidirectional information exchange topologies. This work takes into account the general case where information flow may be unidirectional due to sensors with limited fields of view or vehicles with directed, power-constrained communication links. Unlike the first-order case, we show that having a (directed) spanning tree is a necessary rather than a sufficient condition for consensus seeking with second-order dynamics. This work focuses on a formal analysis of information exchange topologies that permit second-order consensus. Given its importance to the stability of the coordinated system, an analysis of the consensus term control gains is also presented, specifically the strength of the information states relative to their derivatives. As an illustrative example, consensus protocols are applied to coordinate the movements of multiple mobile robots. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This paper looks at the design of a distributed control scheme to solve different formation shape control problems in an ambient two-dimensional space with bearing, distance and mixed bearing and distance constraints. The proposed control law allows the agents in the formation to move in any direction on a half-plane and guarantees that despite this freedom, the proposed shape control algorithm ensures convergence to a formation shape meeting the prescribed constraints. This work provides an interesting and novel contrast to much of the existing work in formation control where distance-only constraints are typically maintained and where each agent's motion is typically restricted to follow a very particular path. A stability analysis is sketched, and a number of illustrative examples are also given. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In a 2-dimensional space, a necessary and sufficient condition for the set of desired bearing vectors to be feasible is derived. Then, we propose a bearing-only control law for every agent and prove that the formation asymptotically converges to a formation specified by a set of feasible desired bearing vectors. Analysis of the equilibrium formations in the plane for a 3-agent system and subsequent extension to an n-agent system is provided. We further extend the analysis on directed triangular formation into a 3-dimensional space. Finally, simulations validate the theoretical results.},

First, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition on the bearing constraints so that the directed cycle formation of n-agents in (n−1)-dimensional space is infinitesimally bearing rigid. Second, a bearing-only control law which only allows motions perpendicular to the desired bearing vector is proposed. Under this control law, the agents globally asymptotically converge to a desired formation which is fully determined from their initial positions and desired bearing vectors. Finally, the proposed formation control law is implemented on mobile robots to support the analysis.},

We propose a bearing-only control strategy for both the position and heading of each agent that guarantees the desired formation is obtained from almost all initial conditions, and ensures that the agents always remain inside the field-of-view of the sensor. We support our analysis with simulations and explore an extension for the 3- and 4-agent case.

abstract = {Abstract With the explosive growth of data communications, existing infrastructure networks are under ever-increasing pressure. Due to the advantages of fully controllable mobility, rapid deployment, and low cost, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted much attentions from both industry and academia in recent years, and it has become an inevitable trend to employ UAVs to enhance the network performance in different environments. As an important paradigm of UAV-assisted communications, UAV relaying communications has been regarded as a promising solution in enhancing connectivity and improving transmission rate. This paper for the first time comprehensively summarizes UAV relaying communications and its application scenarios, including single UAV relaying networks, multi-user UAV relaying networks, multi-hop UAV relaying networks, as well as Internet of UAVs, and deeply analyzes the key technologies and challenges to be solved under this topic. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art researches and opportunities of UAV relaying communications are discussed in detail.}

A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works."
