  "abstract": "Van der Waals interactions are ubiquitous and they play an important role for the stability of materials. Current understanding of this type of coupling is based on linear response theory, while optical nonlinearities are rarely considered in this context. Many materials, however, exhibit strong optical nonlinear response, which prompts further evaluation of dispersive forces beyond linear response. Here we present a $\\textit{Discrete Coupled Nonlinear Dipole}$ approach that takes into account linear and nonlinear properties of all dipolar nanoparticles in a given system. This method is based on a Hamiltonian for nonlinear dipoles, which we apply in different systems uncovering a complex interplay of distance, anisotropy, polarizibilities, and hyperpolarizabilities in the vdW energy. This investigation broadens our basic understanding of dispersive interactions, especially in the context of nonlinear materials.",
