  "abstract": "It is obvious that both epigenetic and non-epigenetic actors contribute to tumorigenesis in chondrosarcomas and more generally in other cancers. Thus, the main altered pathways in chondrosarcomas are now well established and include both epigenetic and non-epigenetic pathways such as the PI3K-AKT signaling, EGFR overexpression, SPARC overexpression, c-myc overexpression, IHH/GLI1 axis, loss of Rb function, HIF1-alpha stabilization, IDH1 mutations, hypermethylation and SIRT1. This review aims to provide a detailed analysis of these pathways and highlights recurrent interactions between non-epigenetic and epigenetic actors in chondrosarcomas, raising the intriguing possibility of developing therapeutics targeting both epigenetic and non-epigenetic actors and supporting data from previous studies. Finally, we propose some strategies for targeting chondrosarcomas in vivo based on properties of this tumor.",
