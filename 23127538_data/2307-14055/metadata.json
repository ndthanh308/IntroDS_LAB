  "abstract": "Measurements of heavy-flavour tagged jets, allow for comparisons of the heavy quarks (charm and beauty) production, propagation, and hadronization across different collision systems. Comparison of measurements performed in pp with Pb--Pb collisions can help in studying the possible modification of the heavy-quark production and hadronization inside jets due to the quark-gluon plasma medium. This article presents the ALICE measurements of jets tagged with D-mesons in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}= 5.02$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV (including the observation of dead-cone effect), as well as in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}= 5.02$ TeV.",
