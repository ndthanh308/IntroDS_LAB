\section{Conclusion}

SEIF combines static analysis and symbolic execution to find
information flows in hardware designs. SEIF improves over static analysis,
eliminating false-positive flows, and finding replayable designs through the
path for true flows. In our experiments, SEIF accounts for 86--90\% of
statically identified flows in three open-source designs. SEIF also leverages
static analysis to explore the designs for 10-12 clock cycles in 4-6 seconds on average.
Additionally, SEIF can be used to find multiple violating paths for security
properties, providing a new angle for security verification.
