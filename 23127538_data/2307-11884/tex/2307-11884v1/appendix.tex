\subsection{Determining the Stall Bound}
We empirically determined the number of clock cycles to stall for each heuristic that involved stalling: baseline 1, 
bounded stalling with backtracking and the UNSAT core heuristic. Once we do not see any significant gains from
stalling for an additional clock cycle, we have found our bound. The results for each of the three heuristics 
are shown in Figures \ref{fig:baseline1-graph-a}, \ref{fig:bd-stalling-graph-a}, and \ref{fig:stalling-unsat-graph-a}.
