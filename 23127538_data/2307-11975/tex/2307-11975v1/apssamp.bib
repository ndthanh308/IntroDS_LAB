Although GstLAL was primarily designed to search for gravitational-wave signatures of merging black holes and neutron stars, it has also contributed to other gravitational-wave searches, data calibration, and detector-characterization efforts. GstLAL has played an integral role in all of the LIGO-Virgo collaboration detections, and its low-latency configuration has enabled rapid electromagnetic follow-up for dozens of compact binary candidates.}
