  "abstract": "The advent of Web 3.0, underpinned by blockchain technologies, promises to transform the internet's landscape by empowering individuals with decentralized control over their data. However, this evolution brings unique security challenges that need to be addressed. This paper explores these complexities, focusing on enhancing privacy and anonymous auditing within blockchain structures. We present the architecture of Web 3.0 based on the blockchain, providing a clear perspective on its workflow and security mechanisms. A security protocol for Web 3.0 systems, employing privacy-preserving techniques and anonymous auditing during runtime, is proposed. Key components of our solution include the integration of privacy-enhancing techniques and the utilization of Tor for anonymous auditing. We discuss related work and propose a framework that meets these new security requirements. Lastly, we offer an evaluation and comparison of our model to existing methods. This research contributes towards the foundational understanding of Web 3.0's secure structure and offers a pathway towards secure and privacy-preserving digital interactions in this novel internet landscape.",
