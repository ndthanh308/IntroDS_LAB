% Change log
%
% v3.0 May 2015
%    Renamed to match the new package name
%    Version number matches mnras.cls
%    A few minor tweaks to wording
% v1.0 September 2013
%    Beta testing only - never publicly released
%    First version: a simple (ish) template for creating an MNRAS paper

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Allow "Thomas van Noord" and "Simon de Laguarde" and alike to be sorted by "N" and "L" etc. in the bibliography.
% Write the name in the bibliography as "\VAN{Noord}{Van}{van} Noord, Thomas"
\DeclareRobustCommand{\VAN}[3]{#2}
\let\VANthebibliography\thebibliography
\def\thebibliography{\DeclareRobustCommand{\VAN}[3]{##3}\VANthebibliography}

This work made use of the supercomputer OzSTAR which is managed through the Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing at Swinburne University of Technology. This supercomputing facility is supported by Astronomy Australia Limited and the Australian Commonwealth Government through the national Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). 
We acknowledge the Virgo Consortium for making
their simulation data available. The \eagle\ simulations were performed using the DiRAC-2 facility at
Durham, managed by the ICC, and the PRACE facility Curie based in France at TGCC, CEA, Bruyeres-le-Chatel.
The C-\eagle\ simulations were in part performed on the German federal maximum performance computer ``HazelHen'' at the maximum performance computing centre Stuttgart (HLRS), under project GCS-HYDA / ID 44067 financed through the large-scale project ``Hydrangea'' of the Gauss Center for Supercomputing. This work has benefitted from the following public {\sc python} packages: {\sc pandas} \citep{mckinney_data_2010}, {\sc scipy} \citep{virtanen_scipy_2020}, {\sc numpy} \citep{harris_array_2020}, and {\sc matplotlib} \citep{hunter_matplotlib_2007}.
