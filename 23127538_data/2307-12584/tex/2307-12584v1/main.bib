The goal of this review is to make the principles behind the hierarchical paradigm accessible to a wide audience by providing a pedagogical introduction to modern theories of galaxy formation. I outline the ingredients of the powerful approach called semi-analytical modelling and contrast this method with numerical simulations of the gas dynamics of baryons. Semi-analytical models have enjoyed many successes, but it is the observations which the models struggle to match which mark out areas where future progress is most likely to be made; these are also reviewed.},

broken-exponential, Ferrer, Moffat, empirical King, point-source, and sky, with a simple mechanism for adding new profiles. We show detailed comparisons between libprofit and
GALFIT. libprofit is both faster and
more accurate than GALFIT at integrating the ubiquitous Sérsic
profile for the most common values of the Sérsic index n (0.5
{\textless} n {\textless} 8). The high-level fitting code PROFIT is tested on a sample of galaxies with both SDSS and deeper KiDS imaging. We find good agreement in the fit parameters, with larger scatter in best-fitting parameters from fitting images from different sources (SDSS versus KiDS) than from using different codes (PROFIT versus GALFIT). A large suite of Monte Carlo-simulated images are used to assess prospects for automated bulge-disc decomposition with PROFIT on SDSS, KiDS, and future LSST imaging. We find that the biggest increases in fit quality come from moving from SDSS- to KiDS-quality data, with less significant gains moving from KiDS to LSST.},

	abstract = {Semi-analytic models are a powerful tool for studying the formation of galaxies. However, these models inevitably involve a significant number of poorly constrained parameters that must be adjusted to provide an acceptable match to the observed universe. In this paper, we set out to quantify the degree to which observational data-sets can constrain the model parameters. By revealing degeneracies in the parameter space we can hope to better understand the key physical processes probed by the data. We use novel mathematical techniques to explore the parameter space of the GALFORM semi-analytic model. We base our investigation on the Bower et al. 2006 version of GALFORM, adopting the same methodology of selecting model parameters based on an acceptable match to the local bJ and K luminosity functions. The model contains 16 parameters that are poorly constrained, and we investigate this parameter space using the Model Emulator technique, constructing a Bayesian approximation to the GALFORM model that can be rapidly evaluated at any point in parameter space. By combining successive waves of emulation, we show that only 0.26\% of the initial volume is of interest for further exploration. However, within this region we show that the Bower et al. 2006 model is only one choice from an extended sub-space of model parameters that can provide equally acceptable fits. We explore the geometry of this region and begin to explore the physical connections between parameters that are exposed by this analysis. We also consider the impact of adding additional observational data to further constrain the parameter space.},

We introduce the philosophy behind Shark and provide an overview of the physical processes included in the model. Shark is written in C++11 and has been parallelized with OpenMP. In the released version (v1.1), we implement several different models for gas cooling, active galactic nuclei, stellar and photo-ionisation feedback, and star formation (SF). We demonstrate the basic performance of Shark using the Planck15 cosmology SURFS simulations, by comparing against a large set of observations, including: the stellar mass function (SMF) and stellar-halo mass relation at z=0-4; the cosmic evolution of the star formation rate density (SFRD), stellar mass, atomic and molecular hydrogen; local gas scaling relations; and structural galaxy properties, finding excellent agreement. Significant improvements over previous SAMs are seen in the mass-size relation for disks/bulges, the gas-stellar mass and stellar mass-metallicity relations. To illustrate the power of Shark in exploring the systematic effects of the galaxy formation modelling, we quantify how the scatter of the SF main sequence and the gas scaling relations changes with the adopted SF law, and the effect of the starbursts H\$\_2\$ depletion timescale on the SFRD and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm H\_2\}\$. We compare Shark with other SAMs and the hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE, and find that SAMs have a much higher halo baryon fractions due to large amounts of intra-halo gas, which in the case of EAGLE is in the intergalactic medium.},

	abstract = {It is now possible for hydrodynamical simulations to reproduce a representative galaxy population. Accordingly, it is timely to assess critically some of the assumptions of traditional semi-analytic galaxy formation models. We use the Eagle simulations to assess assumptions built into the Galform semi-analytic model, focussing on those relating to baryon cycling, angular momentum and feedback. We show that the assumption in Galform that newly formed stars have the same specific angular momentum as the total disc leads to a significant overestimate of the total stellar specific angular momentum of disc galaxies. In Eagle, stars form preferentially out of low specific angular momentum gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) due to the assumed gas density threshold for stars to form, leading to more realistic galaxy sizes. We find that stellar mass assembly is similar between Galform and Eagle but that the evolution of gas properties is different, with various indications that the rate of baryon cycling in Eagle is slower than is assumed in Galform. Finally, by matching individual galaxies between Eagle and Galform, we find that an artificial dependence of AGN feedback and gas infall rates on halo mass doubling events in Galform drives most of the scatter in stellar mass between individual objects. Put together our results suggest that the Galform semi-analytic model can be significantly improved in light of recent advances.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies since observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circum-glactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic 'feedback' from massive stars and accreting super-massive black holes - generally unresolved in cosmological simulations - plays a major role for driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible sub-resolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e. outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multi-phase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsecs scales of large scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the non-thermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays.},

	abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today, due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon (\$z{\textbackslash}sim 2-3\$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

	abstract = {The observed stellar mass function (SMF) is very different to the halo mass function predicted by Lambda-CDM, and it is widely accepted that this is due to energy feedback from supernovae and black holes. However, the strength and form of this feedback is not understood. In this paper, we use the phenomenological model GALFORM to explore how galaxy formation depends on the strength and halo mass dependence of feedback. We focus on 'expulsion' models in which the wind mass loading, beta, is proportional to 1/{\textbackslash}vdisk{\textasciicircum}n, with n=0,1,2 and contrast these models with the successful Bower et al.{\textbackslash} 2008 model (B8W7). A crucial development is that our code explicitly accounts for the recapture of expelled gas as the system's halo mass (and thus gravitational potential) increases. We find that a model with modest wind speed but high mass loading matches the flat portion of the SMF. When combined with AGN feedback, the model provides a good description of the observed SMF above 10{\textasciicircum}9 h{\textasciicircum}-1 Msol. However, in the expulsion models, the brightest galaxies are assembled more recently than in B8W7, and the specific star formation rates of galaxies decrease strongly with decreasing stellar mass. The expulsion models also tend to have a cosmic star formation density that is dominated by lower mass galaxies at z=1-3, and dominated high mass galaxies at low redshift. These trends are in conflict with observational data, but the comparison highlights some deficiencies of the B8W7 model also. The experiments in this paper give us important physical insight to the impact of the feedback process on the formation histories of galaxies, but the strong mass dependence of feedback adopted in B8W7 still appears to provide the most promising description of the observed universe.},

In this paper we apply them without recalibration and this leads to a wide variety of predictions for the stellar mass function, specific star formation rates, stellar-to- halo mass ratios, and the abundance of orphan galaxies. The scatter is much larger than seen in previous comparison studies primarily because the codes have been used outside of their native environment within which they are well tested and calibrated. The purpose of the `nIFTy comparison of galaxy formation models' is to bring together as many different galaxy formation modellers as possible and to investigate a common approach to model calibration. This paper provides a unified description for all participating models and presents the initial, uncalibrated comparison as a baseline for our future studies where we will develop a common calibration framework and address the extent to which that reduces the scatter in the model predictions seen here.},

	abstract = {While a fully-coherent all-sky search is known to be optimal for detecting gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences, its high computational cost has limited current searches to less sensitive coincidence-based schemes. Following up on previous work that has demonstrated the effectiveness of Particle Swarm Optimization in reducing the computational cost of this search, we present an implementation that achieves near real-time computational speed. This is achieved by combining the search efficiency of PSO with an optimized numerical implementation of the underlying mathematical formalism and several parallelization layers in a distributed computing framework. For a network of four second-generation detectors with \$60\${\textasciitilde}min data from each, the runtime of the implementation presented here ranges between \${\textbackslash}approx 1.4\$ to \${\textbackslash}approx 0.5\$ times the data duration for network signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10\$ and \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 12\$, respectively. The reduced runtimes are obtained with small to negligible losses in detection sensitivity: for a false alarm rate of \${\textbackslash}simeq 1\${\textasciitilde}event per year in Gaussian stationary noise, the loss in detection probability is \${\textbackslash}leq 5{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \${\textbackslash}leq 2{\textbackslash}\%\$ for SNRs of \$10\$ and \$12\$, respectively. Using the fast implementation, we are able to quantify frequentist errors in parameter estimation for signals in the double neutron star mass range using a large number of simulated data realizations.},

In addition, the observations have not been successfully reproduced by state-of-the-art cosmological simulations which tend to predict a factor of 2-4 smaller SFRs at a fixed \$\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$. We examine the evolution of the SFR\$-\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ relation of \$z = 1-4 \$ galaxies using the SKIRT simulated spectral energy distributions of galaxies sampled from the EAGLE simulations. We derive SFRs and stellar masses by mimicking different observational techniques. We find that the tension between observed and simulated SFR\$-\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ relations is largely alleviated if similar methods are used to infer the galaxy properties. We find that relations relying on infrared wavelengths (e.g. 24 \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}mu m\}\$, MIPS - 24, 70 and 160 \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}mu m\}\$ or SPIRE - 250, 350, 500 \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}mu m\}\$) have SFRs that exceed the intrinsic relation by 0.5 dex. Relations that rely on the spectral energy distribution fitting technique underpredict the SFRs at a fixed stellar mass by -0.5 dex at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 4\$ but overpredict the measurements by 0.3 dex at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 1\$. Relations relying on dust-corrected rest-frame UV luminosities, are flatter since they overpredict/underpredict SFRs for low/high star forming objects and yield deviations from the intrinsic relation from 0.10 dex to -0.13 dex at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 4\$. We suggest that the severe tension between different observational studies can be broadly explained by the fact that different groups employ different techniques to infer their SFRs.},

	abstract = {We present a fast and accurate method to select an optimal set of parameters in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution (SAMs). Our approach compares the results of a model against a set of observables applying a stochastic technique called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a self-learning algorithm for localizing regions of maximum likelihood in multidimensional spaces that outperforms traditional sampling methods in terms of computational cost. We apply the PSO technique to the SAG semi-analytic model combined with merger trees extracted from a standard \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM N-body simulation. The calibration is performed using a combination of observed galaxy properties as constraints, including the local stellar mass function and the black hole to bulge mass relation. We test the ability of the PSO algorithm to find the best set of free parameters of the model by comparing the results with those obtained using a MCMC exploration. Both methods find the same maximum likelihood region, however the PSO method requires one order of magnitude less evaluations. This new approach allows a fast estimation of the best-fitting parameter set in multidimensional spaces, providing a practical tool to test the consequences of including other astrophysical processes in SAMs.},

Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this ﬁrst paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for ‘radio’ feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling ﬂows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological ‘radio mode’ model to be successful.},

	abstract = {In addition to the large systematic differences arising from assumptions about the stellar mass-to-light ratio, the massive end of the stellar mass function is rather sensitive to how one fits the light profiles of the most luminous galaxies. We quantify this by comparing the luminosity and stellar mass functions based on SDSS cmodel magnitudes, and PyMorph single-Sersic and Sersic-Exponential fits to the surface brightness profiles of galaxies in the SDSS. The PyMorph fits return more light, so that the predicted masses are larger than when cmodel magnitudes are used. As a result, the total stellar mass density at z{\textasciitilde}0.1 is about 1.2x larger than in our previous analysis of the SDSS. The differences are most pronounced at the massive end, where the measured number density of objects having M* {\textgreater} 6 x 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} Msun is {\textasciitilde}5x larger. Alternatively, at number densities of 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\} Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}, the limiting stellar mass is 2x larger. The differences with respect to fits by other authors, typically based on Petrosian-like magnitudes, are even more dramatic, although some of these differences are due to sky-subtraction problems, and are sometimes masked by large differences in the assumed \$M\_*/L\$ (even after scaling to the same IMF). Our results impact studies of the growth and assembly of stellar mass in galaxies, and of the relation between stellar and halo mass, so we provide simple analytic fits to these new luminosity and stellar mass functions and quantify how they depend on morphology, as well as the binned counts in electronic format.},

	abstract = {The concentration parameter is a key characteristic of a dark matter halo that conveniently connects the halo's present-day structure with its assembly history. Using 'Dark Sky', a suite of cosmological \$N\$-body simulations, we investigate how halo concentration evolves with time and emerges from the mass assembly history. We also explore the origin of the scatter in the relation between concentration and assembly history. We show that the evolution of halo concentration has two primary modes: (1) smooth increase due to pseudo-evolution; and (2) intense responses to physical merger events. Merger events induce lasting and substantial changes in halo structures, and we observe a universal response in the concentration parameter. We argue that merger events are a major contributor to the uncertainty in halo concentration at fixed halo mass and formation time. In fact, even haloes that are typically classified as having quiescent formation histories experience multiple minor mergers. These minor mergers drive small deviations from pseudo-evolution, which cause fluctuations in the concentration parameters and result in effectively irreducible scatter in the relation between concentration and assembly history. Hence, caution should be taken when using present-day halo concentration parameter as a proxy for the halo assembly history, especially if the recent merger history is unknown.},

Here, we present a technique to observationally measure this correlation strength for isolated Milky Way-mass galaxies with \$z {\textless} 0.123\$. This technique is based on correlations between dark matter accretion rates and the projected density profile of neighbouring galaxies; these correlations also underlie past work with splashback radii. We apply our technique to both observed galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as well as simulated galaxies in the UniverseMachine where we can test any desired correlation strength. We find that positive correlations between dark matter accretion and recent star formation activity are ruled out with \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 85{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence. Our results suggest that star formation activity may not be correlated with fresh accretion for isolated Milky Way-mass galaxies at \$z=0\$ and that other processes, such as gas recycling, dominate further galaxy growth.},

We present calibrations of and the enclosed mass, , as a function of mass accretion rate and peak height. We find that is in the range for rapidly accreting halos and is for slowly accreting halos.

We investigate whether or not global properties of the ESC could be used to test of dark matter, reasoning that they should be sensitive to the abundance of low-mass satellites, and therefore the underlying dark matter model. Using cosmological simulations of galaxy formation in the favored Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models (), which suppress the abundance of low-mass satellites, we find that the kinematics and orbital structure of the ESC is consistent across models. However, we find striking differences in its spatial structure, as anticipated—a factor of ∼10 drop in spherically averaged mass density between ∼10\% and ∼75\% of the virial radius in the more extreme WDM runs ( = 0.5, 1 ) relative to the CDM run. These differences are consistent with the mass assembly histories of the different components, and are present across redshifts. However, even the least discrepant of the WDM models is incompatible with current observational limits on . Importantly, the differences we observe when varying the underlying dark matter are comparable to the galaxy-to-galaxy variation we expect within a fixed dark matter model. This suggests that it will be challenging to place limits on dark matter using only the unresolved spatial structure of the the ESC.},

haloes host a visible galaxy, and baryon effects lower their growth rate. In this regime, reliance on dark matter only simulations for abundance matching is inappropriate and can lead to incorrect results. We find that the reported discrepancy between observational estimates of the halo masses of dwarf galaxies and the values predicted by abundance matching does not point to a failure of Λ cold dark matter, but
simply to a failure to account for baryonic effects. Our results also imply that the Local Group contains only a few hundred observable galaxies in contrast with the thousands of faint dwarfs that abundance matching would suggest. We show how relations derived from abundance matching can be corrected, so that they can be used self-consistently to calibrate models of galaxy formation.},

These models are each applied to the same set of halo merger trees extracted from the “Bolshoi” high-resolution cosmological N-body simulation and are carefully tuned to match the local galaxy stellar mass function using the powerful method of Bayesian Inference coupled with Markov Chain Monte Carlo or by hand. The comparisons reveal that in spite of the significantly different parameterizations for star formation and feedback processes, the three models yield qualitatively similar predictions for the assembly histories of galaxy stellar mass and star formation over cosmic time. Comparing SAM predictions with existing estimates of the stellar mass function from z = 0-8, we show that the SAMs generally require strong outflows to suppress star formation in low-mass halos to match the present-day stellar mass function, as is the present common wisdom. However, all of the models considered produce predictions for the star formation rates (SFRs) and metallicities of low-mass galaxies that are inconsistent with existing data. The predictions for metallicity-stellar mass relations and their evolution clearly diverge between the models. We suggest that large differences in the metallicity relations and small differences in the stellar mass assembly histories of model galaxies stem from different assumptions for the outflow mass-loading factor produced by feedback. Importantly, while more accurate observational measurements for stellar mass, SFR and metallicity of galaxies at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 5 will discriminate between models, the discrepancies between the constrained models and existing data of these observables have already revealed challenging problems in understanding star formation and its feedback in galaxy formation. The three sets of models are being used to construct catalogs of mock galaxies on light cones that have the same geometry as the CANDELS survey, which should be particularly useful for quantifying the biases and uncertainties on measurements and inferences from the real observations.},

	abstract = {We use the hydrodynamical EAGLE simulation to study the magnitude and origin of the scatter in the stellar mass - halo mass relation for central galaxies. We separate cause and effect by correlating stellar masses in the baryonic simulation with halo properties in a matched dark matter only (DMO) simulation. The scatter in stellar mass increases with redshift and decreases with halo mass. At \$z = 0.1\$ it declines from 0.25 dex at \$M\_\{200, {\textbackslash}rm DMO\} {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ to 0.12 dex at \$M\_\{200, {\textbackslash}rm DMO\} {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, but the trend is weak above \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. For \$M\_\{200, {\textbackslash}rm DMO\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{12.5\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ up to 0.04 dex of the scatter is due to scatter in the halo concentration. At fixed halo mass, a larger stellar mass corresponds to a more concentrated halo. This is likely because higher concentrations imply earlier formation times and hence more time for accretion and star formation, and/or because feedback is less efficient in haloes with higher binding energies. The maximum circular velocity, \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max, DMO\}\$, and binding energy are therefore more fundamental properties than halo mass, meaning that they are more accurate predictors of stellar mass, and we provide fitting formulae for their relations with stellar mass. However, concentration alone cannot explain the total scatter in the \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm star\} - M\_\{200, {\textbackslash}rm DMO\}\$ relation, and it does not explain the scatter in \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm star\} -V\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max, DMO\}\$. Halo spin, sphericity, triaxiality, substructure and environment are also not responsible for the remaining scatter, which thus could be due to more complex halo properties or non-linear/stochastic baryonic effects.},

role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is
that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales
arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes
and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical
dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of
nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the
virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive
halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar
gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds
up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge
into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound
cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and
acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous
galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the
masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific
assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably
well with observation.},

The model will run on any N-body simulation whose trees are organised in a supported format and contain a minimum set of basic halo properties. In this work we present the baryonic prescriptions implemented in SAGE to describe the formation and evolution of galaxies, and their calibration for three N-body simulations: Millennium, Bolshoi, and GiggleZ. Updated physics include: gas accretion, ejection due to feedback, and reincorporation via the galactic fountain; a new gas cooling--radio mode active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating cycle; AGN feedback in the quasar mode; a new treatment of gas in satellite galaxies; and galaxy mergers, disruption, and the build-up of intra-cluster stars.

	abstract = {We present a new version of the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. This brings together several previous developments of GALFORM into a single unified model, including a different initial mass function (IMF) in quiescent star formation and in starbursts, feedback from active galactic nuclei suppressing gas cooling in massive haloes, and a new empirical star formation law in galaxy discs based on their
molecular gas content. In addition, we have updated the cosmology, introduced a more accurate treatment of dynamical friction acting on satellite galaxies, and updated the stellar population model. The new model is able to simultaneously explain both the observed evolution of the K-band luminosity function and stellar mass function, and the number counts and redshift distribution of sub-mm galaxies selected at 850 μm. This was not previously achieved by a single physical model
within the Λcold dark matter framework, but requires having an
IMF in starbursts that is somewhat top-heavy. The new model is tested against a wide variety of observational data covering wavelengths from the far-UV to sub-mm, and redshifts from z = 0 to 6, and is found to be generally successful. These observations include the optical and near-infrared (IR) luminosity functions, H I mass function, fraction of early type galaxies, Tully-Fisher, metallicity-luminosity and
size-luminosity relations at z = 0, as well as far-IR number counts, and far-UV luminosity functions at z ∼ 3-6. Discrepancies are, however, found in galaxy sizes and metallicities at low luminosities, and in the abundance of low-mass galaxies at high-z, suggesting the need for a more sophisticated model of supernova feedback.},

	abstract = {We present a new semi-analytic model that self-consistently traces the 
growth of supermassive black holes (BH) and their host galaxies within
the context of the Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological
framework. In our model, the energy emitted by accreting black holes
regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic
scale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces
powerful jets that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and
clusters. We present a comprehensive comparison of our model predictions
with observational measurements of key physical properties of
low-redshift galaxies, such as cold gas fractions, stellar metallicities
and ages, and specific star formation rates. We find that our new models
successfully reproduce the exponential cut-off in the stellar mass
function and the stellar and cold gas mass densities at z {\textasciitilde} 0, and
predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely,
quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our
model of self-regulated BH growth naturally reproduces the observed
relation between BH mass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation
history of galaxies and black holes in our models, presenting
predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation, stellar mass
assembly, cold gas and metals. We find that models assuming the
`concordance' ΛCDM cosmology overproduce star formation and
stellar mass at high redshift (z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2). A model with less small-scale
power predicts less star formation at high redshift, and excellent
agreement with the observed stellar mass assembly history, but may have
difficulty accounting for the cold gas in quasar absorption systems at
high redshift (z {\textasciitilde} 3-4).},

Information about the star formation, feedback and chemical-enrichment histories of discs is stored in 12 concentric rings. The new model retains the success of its predecessor in reproducing the observed evolution of the galaxy population, in particular, stellar mass functions and passive fractions over the redshift range 0{\textless}=z{\textless}=3 and mass range 8{\textless}=log(M\_*/Msun){\textless}=12, the black hole-bulge mass relation at z=0, galaxy morphology as a function of stellar mass and the mass-metallicity relations of both stellar and gas components. In addition, its detailed modelling of the radial structure of discs allows qualitatively new comparisons with observation, most notably with the relative sizes and masses of the stellar, atomic and molecular components in discs. Good agreement is found with recent data. Comparison of results obtained for simulations differing in mass resolution by more than two orders of magnitude shows that all important distributions are numerically well converged even for this more detailed model. An examination of metallicity and surface-density gradients in the stars and gas indicates that our new model, with star formation, chemical enrichment and feedback calculated self-consistently on local disc scales, reproduces some but not all of the trends seen in recent many-galaxy IFU surveys.},

	abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission
temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard
spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law
spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base ΛCDM"
in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0 = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s-1Mpc-1, a matter density parameter Ωm = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted
scalar spectral index with ns = 0.968 ± 0.006,
consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization
measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing data, these
measurements give a reionization optical depth of τ = 0.066 ±
0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of
z\_re=8.8+1.7-1.4. These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base ΛCDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations with other astrophysical data we find Neff = 3.15 ± 0.23
for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value Neff = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to ∑
mν {\textless} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with {\textbar} ΩK {\textbar} {\textless} 0.005.
Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base ΛCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of
r0.002{\textless} 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of
r0.002 {\textless} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V(φ) ∝ φ2 potential. The addition of Planck
polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a
cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We
also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base ΛCDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak
gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base ΛCDM cosmology.
Apart from these tensions, the base ΛCDM cosmology provides an
excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

	abstract = {WMAP precision data enable accurate testing of cosmological models. We 
find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat
Λ-dominated universe seeded by a nearly scale-invariant adiabatic
Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. For the WMAP data only, the
best-fit parameters are h=0.72+/-0.05,
Ωbh2=0.024+/-0.001,
Ωmh2=0.14+/-0.02,
τ=0.166+0.076-0.071,
ns=0.99+/-0.04, and σ8=0.9+/-0.1. With
parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale cosmic
microwave background (CMB) measurements and measurements of large-scale
structure (galaxy surveys and the Lyα forest). This simple model
is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements: its
inferred age of the universe is consistent with stellar ages, the
baryon/photon ratio is consistent with measurements of the [D/H] ratio,
and the inferred Hubble constant is consistent with local observations
of the expansion rate. We then fit the model parameters to a combination
of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI),
2dFGRS measurements, and Lyα forest data to find the model's
best-fit cosmological parameters:
h=0.71+0.04-0.03,
Ωbh2=0.0224+/-0.0009,
Ωmh2=0.135+0.008-0.009,
τ=0.17+/-0.06, ns(0.05 Mpc-1)=0.93+/-0.03, and
σ8=0.84+/-0.04. WMAP's best determination of
τ=0.17+/-0.04 arises directly from the temperature-polarization (TE)
data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These
parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+/-0.2 Gyr. With
the Lyα forest data, the model favors but does not require a
slowly varying spectral index. The significance of this running index is
sensitive to the uncertainties in the Lyα forest.

By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data, we constrain the
geometry of the universe, Ωtot=1.02+/-0.02, and the
equation of state of the dark energy, w{\textless}-0.78 (95\% confidence limit
assuming w{\textgreater}=-1). The combination of WMAP and 2dFGRS data constrains
the energy density in stable neutrinos:
Ωνh2{\textless}0.0072 (95\% confidence limit).
For three degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their
mass is less than 0.23 eV (95\% confidence limit). The WMAP detection of
early reionization rules out warm dark matter.

WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and the
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the

	abstract = {Predicting structural properties of dark matter haloes is one of the 
fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the suite of MultiDark
cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo
density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. We find
that in order to understand the structure of dark matter haloes and to
make 1-2 per cent accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs
to realize that halo concentration is more complex than the ratio of the
virial radius to the core radius in the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
profile. For massive haloes, the average density profile is far from the
NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the core radius and
the shape parameter α in the Einasto approximation. We show that
haloes progress through three stages of evolution. They start as rare
density peaks and experience fast and nearly radial infall that brings
mass closer to the centre, producing a highly concentrated halo. Here,
the halo concentration increases with increasing halo mass and the
concentration is defined by the α parameter with a nearly constant
core radius. Later haloes slide into the plateau regime where the
accretion becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even
the central region. At this stage, the concentration does not depend on
halo mass. Once the rate of accretion and merging slows down, haloes
move into the domain of declining concentration-mass relation because
new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the core
radius is staying constant. Accurate analytical fits are provided.},

	abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10{\textasciicircum}10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10{\textasciicircum}5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

We use a suite of cosmological simulations and idealised numerical experiments to show that 2-body scattering is exacerbated in situations where there are two species of unequal mass. This is a consequence of mass segregation and reflects a flow of kinetic energy from the more to less massive particles. This has important implications for the interpretation of galaxy sizes in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, which nearly always model stars with less massive particles than are used for the dark matter. We compare idealised models as well as simulations from the EAGLE project that differ only in the mass resolution of the dark matter component, but keep sub-grid physics, baryonic mass resolution and gravitational force softening fixed. If the dark matter particle mass exceeds the mass of stellar particles, then galaxy sizes--quantified by their projected half-mass radii, \$\{{\textbackslash}rm R\_\{50\}\}\$--increase systematically with time until \$\{{\textbackslash}rm R\_\{50\}\}\$ exceeds a small fraction of the redshift-dependent mean inter-particle separation, \$l\$ (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm R\_\{50\}\}{\textbackslash}geq 0.05{\textbackslash}times l\$). Our conclusions should also apply to simulations that adopt different hydrodynamic solvers, subgrid physics or adaptive softening, but in that case may need quantitative revision. Any simulation employing a stellar-to-dark matter particle mass ratio greater than unity will escalate spurious energy transfer from dark matter to baryons on small scales.},

The surface brightness of the diffuse light shows an increasing dependence on cluster total mass at larger radius, and appears to be self-similar with a universal radial dependence after scaling by cluster radius.We also compare the diffuse light radial profiles to the cluster (baryonic and dark) matter distribution measured through weak lensing and find them to be comparable. The IllustrisTNG galaxy formation simulation offers further insight into the connection between diffuse stellar mass and cluster matter distributions -- the simulation radial profile of the diffuse stellar component does not have a similar slope with the total cluster matter content, although that of the cluster satellite galaxies does. Regardless of the radial trends, the amount of diffuse stellar mass has a low-scatter scaling relation with cluster's total mass in the simulation, out-performing the total stellar mass of cluster satellite galaxies. We conclude that there is no consistent evidence on whether or not diffuse light is a faithful radial tracer of the cluster matter distribution. Nevertheless, both observational and simulation results reveal that diffuse light is an excellent indicator of the cluster's total mass.},

We explore the impact of these new recipes on the evolution of fundamental galaxy properties such as stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas and stellar phase metallicity. We present predictions for stellar mass functions, stellar mass vs. SFR relations, and cold gas phase and stellar mass-metallicity relations for our fiducial models, from redshift \$z{\textbackslash}sim 6\$ to the present day. In addition we present predictions for the global SFR, mass assembly history, and cosmic enrichment history. We find that the predicted stellar properties of galaxies (stellar mass, SFR, metallicity) are remarkably insensitive to the details of the recipes used for partitioning gas into HI and H\$\_2\$. We see significant sensitivity to the recipes for H\$\_2\$ formation only in very low mass halos, which host galaxies that are not detectable with current observational facilities except very nearby. The properties of low-mass galaxies are also quite insensitive to the details of the recipe used for converting H\$\_2\$ into stars, while the formation epoch of massive galaxies does depend on this significantly.

	abstract = {We present results from the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation SAG applied on the MultiDark simulation MDPL2. SAG features an updated supernova (SN) feedback scheme and a robust modelling of the environmental effects on satellite galaxies. This incorporates a gradual starvation of the hot gas halo driven by the action of ram pressure stripping (RPS), that can affect the cold gas disc, and tidal stripping (TS), which can act on all baryonic components. Galaxy orbits of orphan satellites are integrated providing adequate positions and velocities for the estimation of RPS and TS. The star formation history and stellar mass assembly of galaxies are sensitive to the redshift dependence implemented in the SN feedback model. We discuss a variant of our model that allows to reconcile the predicted star formation rate density at \$z {\textbackslash}gtrsim 3\$ with the observed one, at the expense of an excess in the faint end of the stellar mass function at \$z=2\$. The fractions of passive galaxies as a function of stellar mass, halo mass and the halo-centric distances are consistent with observational measurements. The model also reproduces the evolution of the main sequence of star forming central and satellite galaxies. The similarity between them is a result of the gradual starvation of the hot gas halo suffered by satellites, in which RPS plays a dominant role. RPS of the cold gas does not affect the fraction of quenched satellites but it contributes to reach the right atomic hydrogen gas content for more massive satellites (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$).},

We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and AGN in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the z{\textasciitilde}0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.2\$ dex over the full mass range, \$10{\textasciicircum}8 {\textless} M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic CIV and OVI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for \$M\_* {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. The gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback.

	abstract = {We examine the influence of dark matter halo assembly on the evolution of a simulated \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\$ galaxy. Starting from a zoom-in simulation of a star-forming galaxy evolved with the EAGLE galaxy formation model, we use the genetic modification technique to create a pair of complementary assembly histories: one in which the halo assembles later than in the unmodified case, and one in which it assembles earlier. Delayed assembly leads to the galaxy exhibiting a greater present-day star formation rate than its unmodified counterpart, whilst in the accelerated case the galaxy quenches at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 1\$, and becomes spheroidal. We simulate each assembly history nine times, adopting different seeds for the random number generator used by EAGLE's stochastic subgrid implementations of star formation and feedback. The systematic changes driven by differences in assembly history are significantly stronger than the random scatter induced by this stochasticity. The sensitivity of \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\$ galaxy evolution to dark matter halo assembly follows from the close coupling of the growth histories of the central black hole (BH) and the halo, such that earlier assembly fosters the formation of a more massive BH, and more efficient expulsion of circumgalactic gas. In response to this expulsion, the circumgalactic medium reconfigures at a lower density, extending its cooling time and thus inhibiting the replenishment of the interstellar medium. Our results indicate that halo assembly history significantly influences the evolution of \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\$ central galaxies, and that the expulsion of circumgalactic gas is a crucial step in quenching them.},

For galaxies with stellar masses of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, \$[{\textbackslash}alpha/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Fe\}]\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$ increases with increasing galaxy stellar mass and age. These trends are in good agreement with observations of early-type galaxies, and are consistent with a `downsizing' galaxy formation scenario: more massive galaxies have formed the bulk of their stars earlier and more rapidly, hence from an interstellar medium that was mostly \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-enriched by massive stars. In the absence of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN), however, \$[{\textbackslash}alpha/{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Fe\}]\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$ in \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ galaxies is roughly constant with stellar mass and decreases with mean stellar age, extending the trends found for lower-mass galaxies in both simulations with and without AGN. We conclude that AGN feedback can account for the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-enhancement of massive galaxies, as it suppresses their star formation, quenching more massive galaxies at earlier times, thereby preventing the iron from longer-lived intermediate-mass stars (supernova Type Ia) from being incorporated into younger stars.},

	abstract = {Early-type galaxies (ETGs) are supposed to follow the virial relation \$M = k\_e {\textbackslash}sigma\_*{\textasciicircum}2 R\_e / G\$, with \$M\$ being the mass, \${\textbackslash}sigma\_*\$ being the stellar velocity dispersion, \$R\_e\$ being the effective radius, \$G\$ being Newton's constant, and \$k\_e\$ being the virial factor, a geometry factor of order unity. Applying this relation to (a) the ATLAS3D sample of Cappellari et al. (2013) and (b) the sample of Saglia et al. (2016) gives ensemble-averaged factors \${\textbackslash}langle k\_e{\textbackslash}rangle =5.15{\textbackslash}pm0.09\$ and \${\textbackslash}langle k\_e{\textbackslash}rangle =4.01{\textbackslash}pm0.18\$, respectively, with the difference arising from different definitions of effective velocity dispersions. The two datasets reveal a statistically significant tilt of the empirical relation relative to the theoretical virial relation such that \$M{\textbackslash}propto({\textbackslash}sigma\_*{\textasciicircum}2R\_e){\textasciicircum}\{0.92\}\$. This tilt disappears when replacing \$R\_e\$ with the semi-major axis of the projected half-light ellipse, \$a\$. All best-fit scaling relations show zero intrinsic scatter, implying that the mass plane of ETGs is fully determined by the virial relation. Whenever a comparison is possible, my results are consistent with, and confirm, the results by Cappellari et al. (2013). The difference between the relations using either \$a\$ or \$R\_e\$ arises from a known lack of highly elliptical high-mass galaxies; this leads to a scaling \$(1-{\textbackslash}epsilon) {\textbackslash}propto M{\textasciicircum}\{0.12\}\$, with \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ being the ellipticity and \$R\_e = a{\textbackslash}sqrt\{1-{\textbackslash}epsilon\}\$. Accordingly, \$a\$, not \$R\_e\$, is the correct proxy for the scale radius of ETGs. By geometry, this implies that early-type galaxies are axisymmetric and oblate in general, in agreement with published results from modeling based on kinematics and light distributions.},

Our fiducial model with a high local star formation efficiency, which results in efficient feedback, produces a realistic late-type galaxy that matches the evolution of basic properties of late-type galaxies: stellar mass, disk size, morphology dominated by a kinematically cold disk, stellar and gas surface density profiles, and specific angular momentum. We argue that feedback’s role in this success is twofold: (1) removal of low angular momentum gas, and (2) maintaining a low disk-to-halo mass fraction, which suppresses disk instabilities that lead to angular momentum redistribution and a central concentration of baryons. However, our model with a low local star formation efficiency, but large energy input per supernova, chosen to produce a galaxy with a similar star formation history as our fiducial model, leads to a highly irregular galaxy with no kinematically cold component, overly extended stellar distribution, and low angular momentum. This indicates that only when feedback is allowed to become vigorous via locally efficient star formation in dense cold gas do resulting galaxy sizes, gas/stellar surface density profiles, and stellar disk angular momenta agree with observed z = 0 galaxies.},

	abstract = {Although supernova explosions and stellar winds happen at very small scales, they aﬀect the interstellar medium (ISM) at galactic scales and regulate the formation of a whole galaxy. Previous attempts of mimicking these eﬀects in simulations of galaxy formation use very simpliﬁed assumptions. We develop a much more realistic prescription for modeling the feedback, which minimizes any ad hoc sub-grid physics. We start with developing high resolution models of the ISM and formulate the conditions required for its realistic functionality: formation of multi-phase medium with hot chimneys, super-bubbles, cold molecular phase, and very slow consumption of gas. We ﬁnd that this can be achieved only by doing what the real Universe does: formation of dense ({\textgreater} 10 H atoms cm−3), cold (T ≈ 100 K) molecular phase, where the star formation happens, and which is disrupted by young stars. Another important ingredient is the runaway stars: massive binary stars ejected from molecular clouds when one of the companions becomes a supernova. Those stars can move to 10-100 parsecs away from molecular clouds before exploding themselves as supernovae. This greatly facilitates the feedback. Once those eﬀects are implemented into cosmological simulations, galaxy formation proceeds more realistically. For example, we do not have the overcooling problem. The angular momentum problem (resulting in a too massive bulge) is also reduced substantially: the rotation curves are nearly ﬂat. The galaxy formation also becomes more violent. Just as often observed in QSO absorption lines, there are substantial outﬂows from forming and active galaxies. At high redshifts we routinely ﬁnd gas with few hundred km s−1 and occasionally 1000 − 2000 km s−1. The gas has high metallicity, which may exceed the solar metallicity. The temperature of the gas in the outﬂows and in chimneys can be very high: T = 107 − 108 K. The density proﬁle of dark matter is still consistent with a cuspy proﬁle. The simulations reproduce this picture only if the resolution is very high: better than 50 pc, which is 10 times better than the typical resolution in previous cosmological simulations.

This suite of hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations resolves formation of star-forming giant molecular clouds to \$z=0\$, and features an explicit stellar feedback model on small scales. Our simulations reveal that high redshift galaxies undergo bursts of star formation followed by powerful gusts of galactic outflows that eject much of the ISM and temporarily suppress star formation. At low redshift, however, sufficiently massive galaxies corresponding to L*-progenitors develop stable disks and switch into a continuous and quiescent mode of star formation that does not drive outflows far into the halo. Mass-loading factors for winds in L*-progenitors are \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}approx 10\$ at high redshift, but decrease to \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}ll 1\$ at low redshift. Although lower values of \${\textbackslash}eta\$ are expected as halos grow in mass over time, we show that the strong suppression of outflows with decreasing redshift cannot be explained by mass evolution alone. Circumgalactic outflow velocities are variable and broadly distributed, but typically range between one and three times the circular velocity of the halo. Much of the ejected material builds a reservoir of enriched gas within the circumgalactic medium, some of which could be later recycled to fuel further star formation. However, a fraction of the gas that leaves the virial radius through galactic winds is never regained, causing most halos with mass \$M\_h {\textbackslash}le 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ to be deficient in baryons compared to the cosmic mean by \$z=0\$.},

By tracing cosmic inflows, galactic outflows, gas recycling, and merger histories, we quantify the contribution of physically distinct sources of material to galaxy growth. We show that in situ star formation fueled by fresh accretion dominates the early growth of galaxies of all masses, while the re-accretion of gas previously ejected in galactic winds often dominates the gas supply for a large portion of every galaxy's evolution. Externally processed material contributes increasingly to the growth of central galaxies at lower redshifts. This includes stars formed ex situ and gas delivered by mergers, as well as smooth intergalactic transfer of gas from other galaxies, an important but previously under-appreciated growth mode. By \$z=0\$, wind transfer, i.e. the exchange of gas between galaxies via winds, can dominate gas accretion onto \${\textbackslash}sim L{\textasciicircum}\{*\}\$ galaxies over fresh accretion and standard wind recycling. Galaxies of all masses re-accrete {\textgreater}50\% of the gas ejected in winds and recurrent recycling is common. The total mass deposited in the intergalactic medium per unit stellar mass formed increases in lower mass galaxies. Re-accretion of wind ejecta occurs over a broad range of timescales, with median recycling times (\${\textbackslash}sim 100-350\$ Myr) shorter than previously found. Wind recycling typically occurs at the scale radius of the halo, independent of halo mass and redshift, suggesting a characteristic recycling zone around galaxies that scales with the size of the inner halo and the galaxy's stellar component.},

	abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to follow the formation and evolution of tidal streams associated with dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). The dSph models are embedded in dark matter (DM) haloes with either a centrally divergent ‘cusp’, or a homogeneous-density ‘core’. In agreement with previous studies, we ﬁnd that as tides strip the galaxy the evolution of the half-light radius and the averaged velocity dispersion follows well-deﬁned tracks that are mainly controlled by the amount of mass lost. Crucially, the evolutionary tracks behave differently depending on the shape of the DM proﬁle: at a ﬁxed remnant mass, dSphs embedded in cored haloes have larger sizes and higher velocity dispersions than their cuspy counterparts. The divergent evolution is particularly pronounced in galaxies whose stellar component is strongly segregated within their DM halo and becomes more disparate as the remnant mass decreases. Our analysis indicates that the DM proﬁle plays an important role in deﬁning the internal dynamics of tidal streams. We ﬁnd that stellar streams associated with cored DM models have velocity dispersions that lie systematically above their cuspy counterparts. These results suggest that modelling the dynamics of streams with known dSph progenitors may reveal the distribution of DM on the smallest galactic scales.},

	abstract = {We use SHARK, a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, to investigate the physical processes involved in dictating the shape, scatter and evolution of the HI-halo mass relation at \$0{\textbackslash}leq z {\textbackslash}leq 2\$. We compare SHARK with HI clustering and spectral stacking of the HI-halo mass relation derived from observations finding excellent agreement with the former and a deficiency of HI in SHARK at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{12-13\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ in the latter, but otherwise great agreement below and above that mass threshold. In SHARK, we find that the HI mass increases with the halo mass up to a critical mass of \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.8\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$; between \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.8\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, the scatter in the relation increases by 0.7 dex and the HI mass decreases with the halo mass on average; at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\} {\textbackslash}geq 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, the HI content continues to increase with halo mass. We find that the critical halo mass of \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ is largely set by feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and the exact shape and scatter of the HI-halo mass relation around that mass is extremely sensitive to how AGN feedback is modelled, with other physical processes playing a less significant role. We determine the main secondary parameters responsible for the scatter of the HI-halo mass relation, namely the halo spin parameter at \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.8\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, and the fractional contribution from substructure to the total halo mass for \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textbackslash}geq 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. The scatter at \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.8\}{\textless}M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm vir\}{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ is best described by the black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio of the central galaxy, reflecting the AGN feedback relevance.

We show that for the standard implementations of supernova feedback and gas reincorporation used in semi-analytic models, this relationship is predicted to evolve weakly over the redshift range 0{\textless}z{\textless}4. Modest evolution in the median stellar mass versus halo mass (SHM) relationship implicitly requires that, at fixed halo mass, the efficiency of stellar mass assembly must be almost constant with cosmic time. We show that in our model, this behaviour can be understood in simple terms as a result of a constant efficiency of gas reincorporation, and an efficiency of SNe feedback that is, on average, constant at fixed halo mass. We present a simple explanation of how feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) acts in our model to introduce a break in the SHM relation whose location is predicted to evolve only modestly. Finally, we show that if modifications are introduced into the model such that, for example, the gas reincorporation efficiency is no longer constant, the median SHM relation is predicted to evolve significantly over 0{\textless}z{\textless}4. Specifically, we consider modifications that allow the model to better reproduce either the evolution of the stellar mass function or the evolution of average star formation rates inferred from observations.},

	abstract = {[abridged] We present a statistical exploration of the parameter space of the De Lucia and Blaizot version of the Munich semi-analytic model built upon the millennium dark matter simulation. This is achieved by applying a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to constrain the 6 free parameters that define the stellar and black-hole mass functions at redshift zero. The model is tested against three different observational data sets, including the galaxy K-band luminosity function, B-V colours, and the black hole-bulge mass relation, separately and combined, to obtain mean values, confidence limits and likelihood contours for the best fit model. Using each observational data set independently, we discuss how the SA model parameters affect each galaxy property and to what extent the correlations between them can lead to improved understandings of the physics of galaxy formation. When all the observations are combined, we find reasonable agreement between the majority of the previously published parameter values and our confidence limits. However, the need to suppress dwarf galaxy formation requires the strength of the supernova feedback to be significantly higher in our best-fit solution than in previous work. To balance this, we require the feedback to become ineffective in halos of lower circular velocity than before, so as to permit the formation of sufficient high-luminosity galaxies: unfortunately, this leads to an excess of galaxies around L*. Although the best-fit is formally consistent with the data, there is no region of parameter space that reproduces the shape of galaxy luminosity function across the whole magnitude-range. We discuss modifications to the semi-analytic model that might simultaneously improve the fit to the observed luminosity function and reduce the reliance on excessive supernova feedback in small halos.},

We build models jointly on the Millennium and Millennium-II simulations, applying fast sampling techniques which allow observed galaxy abundances over the ranges 7{\textless}log(M*/Msun){\textless}12 and z=0 to z=3 to be used simultaneously as constraints in the MCMC analysis. When z=0 constraints alone are imposed, we reproduce the results of previous modelling by Guo et al. (2012), but no single set of parameters can reproduce observed galaxy abundances at all redshifts simultaneously, reflecting the fact that low-mass galaxies form too early and thus are overabundant at high redshift in this model. The data require the efficiency with which galactic wind ejecta are reaccreted to vary with redshift and halo mass quite differently than previously assumed, but in a similar way as in some recent hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. We propose a specific model in which reincorporation timescales vary inversely with halo mass and are independent of redshift. This produces an evolving galaxy population which fits observed abundances as a function of stellar mass, B- and K-band luminosity at all redshifts simultaneously. It also produces a significant improvement in two other areas where previous models were deficient. It leads to present day dwarf galaxy populations which are younger, bluer, more strongly star-forming and more weakly clustered on small scales than before, although the passive fraction of faint dwarfs remains too high.},

The sample spans a factor of five in mean metallicity. The rms scatter of individual points of the relation is only about a factor of two for all the galaxies, though some show much more scatter than others. Using these results, we propose a modified star formation prescription based on pressure determining the degree to which the ISM is molecular. The formulation is different in high and low pressure regimes defined by whether the gas is primarily atomic or primarily molecular. This formulation can be implemented in simulations and provides a more appropriate treatment of the outer regions of spiral galaxies and molecule-poor systems such as dwarf irregulars and damped Lyman-alpha systems.},

The bubbles are followed until the point of break-out into the halo, starting from an initial adiabatic phase to a radiative phase. We show that a key property which sets the fate of bubbles in the ISM is the gas surface density, through the work done by the expansion of bubbles and its role in setting the gas scaleheight. The multi-phase description of the ISM is essential, and neglecting it leads to order of magnitude differences in the predicted outflow rates. We compare our predicted mass loading and outflow velocities to observations of local and high-redshift galaxies and find good agreement over a wide range of stellar masses and velocities. With the aim of analysing the dependence of the mass loading of the outflow, beta (i.e. the ratio between the outflow and star formation rates), on galaxy properties, we embed our model in the galaxy formation simulation, GALFORM, set in the LCDM framework. We find that a dependence of beta solely on the circular velocity, as is widely assumed in the literature, is actually a poor description of the outflow rate, as large variations with redshift and galaxy properties are obtained. Moreover, we find that below a circular velocity of 80km/s the mass loading saturates. A more fundamental relation is that between beta and the gas scaleheight of the disk, hg, and the gas fraction, fgas, as beta hg{\textasciicircum}(1.1) fgas{\textasciicircum}(0.4), or the gas surface density, {\textbackslash}Sigma\_g, and the gas fraction, as beta {\textbackslash}Sigma\_g{\textasciicircum}(-0.6) fgas{\textasciicircum}(0.8).

	abstract = {We consider a model for quasar formation in which massive black holes are formed and fuelled largely by the accretion of hot gas during the process of galaxy formation. In standard hierarchical collapse models, objects about the size of normal galaxies and larger form a dense hot atmosphere when they collapse. We show that if such an atmosphere forms a nearly "maximal" cooling flow, then a central black hole can accrete at close to its Eddington limit. This leads to exponential growth of a seed black hole, resulting in a quasar in some cases. In this model, the first quasars form soon after the first collapses to produce hot gas. The hot gas is depleted as time progresses, mostly by cooling, so that the accretion rate eventually falls below the threshold for advection-dominated accretion, at which stage radiative efficiency plummets and any quasar turns off. A simple implementation of this model, incorporated into a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation, over-produces quasars when compared with observed luminosity functions, but is consistent with models of the X-ray Background which indicate that most accretion is obscured. It produces few quasars at high redshift due to the lack of time needed to grow massive black holes. Quasar fuelling by hot gas provides a minimum level, sufficient to power most quasars at redshifts between one and two, to which other sources of fuel can be added. The results are sensitive to feedback effects, such as might be due to radio jets and other outflows.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical models of structure formation predict that dark matter halo assembly histories are characterised by episodic mergers and interactions with other haloes. An accurate description of this process will provide insights into the dynamical evolution of haloes and the galaxies that reside in them. Using large cosmological N-body simulations, we characterise halo orbits to study the interactions between substructure haloes and their hosts, and how different evolutionary histories map to different classes of orbits. We use two new software tools - WhereWolf, which uses halo group catalogues and merger trees to ensure that haloes are tracked accurately in dense environments, and OrbWeaver, which quantifies each halo's orbital parameters. We demonstrate how WhereWolf improves the accuracy of halo merger trees, and we use OrbWeaver to quantify orbits of haloes. We assess how well analytical prescriptions for the merger timescale from the literature compare to measured merger timescales from our simulations and find that existing prescriptions perform well, provided the ratio of substructure-to-host mass is not too small. In the limit of small substructure-to-host mass ratio, we find that the prescriptions can overestimate the merger timescales substantially, such that haloes are predicted to survive well beyond the end of the simulation. This work highlights the need for a revised analytical prescription for the merger timescale that more accurately accounts for processes such as catastrophic tidal disruption.},

We obtained high-resolution spectra of 8 bright QSOs at 3.1{\textless}z{\textless}4.1 and spectroscopic redshifts for 431 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at slightly lower redshifts. Comparing the locations of galaxies to the absorption lines in the QSO spectra shows that the intergalactic medium contains less neutral hydrogen than the global average within r{\textless}0.5h{\textasciicircum}-1 comoving Mpc of LBGs and more than average at slightly larger distances 1{\textless}r{\textless}5 h{\textasciicircum}-1 comoving Mpc. The intergalactic medium within the largest overdensities at z{\textasciitilde}3, which will presumably evolve into the intracluster medium by z{\textasciitilde}0, is rich in neutral hydrogen and CIV. The lack of HI absorption at small distances from LBGs appears unlikely to be produced solely by the Lyman continuum radiation they emit; it may show that the galaxies' supernovae-driven winds maintain their measured outflow velocities of {\textasciitilde}600 km/s for a few hundred million years and drive away nearby intergalactic gas. We present correlation functions of galaxies with Lyman-alpha forest flux decrements, with CIV systems, and with other galaxies. We describe the association of galaxies with damped Lyman-a systems and with intergalactic HeII opacity. A strong observed correlation of galaxies with intergalactic metals supports the idea that Lyman-break galaxies' winds have enriched their surroundings.},

	abstract = {Semi-analytic models (SAMs) are a promising means of tracking the physical processes associated with galaxy formation, but many of their approximations have not been rigorously tested. As part of the SMAUG (Simulating Multiscale Astrophysics to Understand Galaxies) project, we compare predictions from the FIRE-2 hydrodynamical "zoom-in" simulations to those from the Santa Cruz SAM run on the same halo merger trees, with an emphasis on the global mass flow cycle. Our study includes 13 halos spanning low-mass dwarfs (M\_vir{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_sun at z=0), intermediate-mass dwarfs (M\_vir{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_sun) and Milky Way-mass galaxies (M\_vir{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun). The SAM and FIRE-2 predictions agree relatively well with each other in terms of stellar and interstellar mass, but differ dramatically on circumgalactic mass (the SAM is lower than FIRE-2 by {\textasciitilde}3 orders of magnitude for dwarfs). Strikingly, the SAM predicts higher gas accretion rates for dwarfs compared to FIRE-2 by factors of {\textasciitilde}10-100, and this is compensated for with higher mass outflow rates in the SAM. We argue that the most severe model discrepancies are caused by the lack of preventative stellar feedback and the assumptions for halo gas cooling and recycling in the SAM. As a first step towards resolving these model tensions, we present a simple yet promising new preventative stellar feedback model in which the energy carried by supernova-driven winds is allowed to heat some fraction of gas outside of halos to at least the virial temperature such that accretion is suppressed.},

	abstract = {We introduce the "Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy formation's Edge" (EDGE) project to study the cosmological formation and evolution of the smallest galaxies in the Universe. In this first paper, we explore the effects of resolution and sub-grid physics on a single low mass halo (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), simulated to redshift \$z=0\$ at a mass and spatial resolution of \${\textbackslash}sim 20{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \${\textbackslash}sim 3\$ pc. We consider different star formation prescriptions, supernova feedback strengths and on-the-fly radiative transfer (RT). We show that RT changes the mode of galactic self-regulation at this halo mass, suppressing star formation by causing the interstellar and circumgalactic gas to remain predominantly warm (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ K) even before cosmic reionisation. By contrast, without RT, star formation regulation occurs only through starbursts and their associated vigorous galactic outflows. In spite of this difference, the entire simulation suite (with the exception of models without any feedback) matches observed dwarf galaxy sizes, velocity dispersions, \$V\$-band magnitudes and dynamical mass-to-light-ratios. This is because such structural scaling relations are predominantly set by the host dark matter halo, with the remaining model-to-model variation being smaller than the observational scatter. We find that only the stellar mass-metallicity relation differentiates the galaxy formation models. Explosive feedback ejects more metals from the dwarf, leading to a lower metallicity at a fixed stellar mass. We conclude that the stellar mass-metallicity relation of the very smallest galaxies provides a unique constraint on galaxy formation physics.},

Compared to observations, the predicted number counts at wavelengths (lambda) 0.6-2mm and redshift distributions at 0.1-2mm, agree well. At the bright end ({\textgreater}1mJy), Shark galaxies are a mix of mergers and disk instabilities. These galaxies display a stacked FUV-to-FIR spectrum that agrees well with observations. We predict that current optical/NIR surveys are deep enough to detect bright ({\textgreater}1mJy) lambda=0.85-2mm-selected galaxies at z{\textless}5, but too shallow to detect counterparts at higher redshift. A JWST 10,000s survey should detect all counterparts for galaxies with \$S\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 0.85mm\}{\textgreater}0.01\$mJy. We predict SMG's disks contribute significantly (negligibly) to the rest-frame UV (IR). We investigate the 0{\textless}z{\textless}6 evolution of the intrinsic properties of {\textgreater}1mJy lambda=0.85-2mm-selected galaxies finding their: (i) stellar masses are \${\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{10.2\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, with the 2mm ones tracing the most massive galaxies in Shark (\${\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$); (ii) average specific star formation rates (SFR) are mildly ({\textasciitilde}3-10x) above the main sequence (MS); (iii) host halo masses are \${\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{12.3\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, with the 2mm galaxies tracing the most massive halos (proto-clusters); (iv) SMGs have lower dust masses (\${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), higher dust temperatures ({\textasciitilde}40-45K) and higher rest-frame V-band attenuation ({\textgreater}1.5) than MS galaxies; (v) sizes decrease with redshift, from 4kpc at z=1 to 1kpc at z=4; (vi) the Carbon Monoxide spectral line energy distributions of \$S\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 0.85mm\}{\textgreater}1\$mJy sources peak at 4-{\textgreater}3. Finally, we study the contribution of SMGs to the molecular gas and cosmic SFR density (CSFRD) at 0{\textless}z{\textless}10, finding that {\textgreater}1mJy sources make a negligible contribution at z{\textgreater}3 and z{\textgreater}5, respectively, suggesting current observations have unveiled the majority of the star formation at 0{\textless}z{\textless}10.},

	abstract = {We use the EAGLE suite of hydrodynamical simulations to analyse accretion rates (and the breakdown of their constituent channels) onto haloes over cosmic time, comparing the behaviour of baryons and dark matter (DM). We also investigate the influence of sub-grid baryon physics on halo-scale inflow, specifically the consequences of modelling radiative cooling, as well as feedback from stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that variations in halo baryon fractions at fixed mass (particularly their circum-galactic medium gas content) are very well correlated with variations in the baryon fraction of accreting matter, which we show to be heavily suppressed by stellar feedback in low-mass haloes, \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm halo\}{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Breaking down accretion rates into first infall, recycled, transfer and merger components, we show that baryons are much more likely to be smoothly accreted than to have originated from mergers when compared to DM, finding (averaged across halo mass) a merger contribution of \${\textbackslash}approx6{\textbackslash}\%\$ for baryons, and \${\textbackslash}approx15{\textbackslash}\%\$ for DM at \$z{\textbackslash}approx0\$. We also show that the breakdown of inflow into different channels is strongly dependent on sub-grid physics, particularly the contribution of recycled accretion (accreting matter that has been previously ejected from progenitor haloes). Our findings highlight the dual role that baryonic feedback plays in regulating the evolution of galaxies and haloes: by (i) directly removing gas from haloes, and (ii) suppressing gas inflow to haloes.},

Two related models are used to describe the evolving distribution of collisionless dark matter: the Press-Schechter formalism and a recently developed Monte Carlo model. The Monte Carlo method follows the merging of halos and hence extends the fully analytic treatment in several ways. First, plausible estimates of halo lifetimes are made. Second, the local depletion of the primordial gas is followed in each halo as progressively more gas cools and forms stars. Finally, limits are set on the merging of protogalaxies. It is shown that, in the absence of any form of energy input, an unacceptably large fraction of the baryons will cool and condense in low-mass halos at high redshift. In order to counteract efficient cooling at early times, it is postulated that energy input by supernovae associated with the first stars formed in these halos is sufficient to unbind the gas in halos with circular velocities less than a critical value Vcrit. Estimates of the present-day luminosity function calculated using this model suggest VCTit {\textgreater} 200 km s “1 and hence that self-regulating or self-limiting star formation operates even in bright L* galaxies.},

	abstract = {We use a compilation of disc galaxy rotation curves to assess the role of the luminous component ("baryons") in the rotation curve diversity problem. As in earlier work, we find that rotation curve shape correlates with baryonic surface density: high surface density galaxies have rapidly-rising rotation curves consistent with cuspy cold dark matter halos; slowly-rising rotation curves (characteristic of galaxies with inner mass deficits or "cores") occur only in low surface density galaxies. The correlation, however, seems too weak to be the main driver of the diversity. In addition, dwarf galaxies exhibit a clear trend, from "cuspy" systems where baryons are unimportant in the inner mass budget to "cored" galaxies where baryons actually dominate. This trend constrains the various scenarios proposed to explain the diversity, such as (i) baryonic inflows and outflows during galaxy formation; (ii) dark matter self-interactions; (iii) variations in the baryonic mass structure coupled to rotation velocities through the "mass discrepancy-acceleration relation" (MDAR); or (iv) non-circular motions in gaseous discs. Together with analytical modeling and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, our analysis shows that each of these scenarios has promising features, but none seems to fully account for the observed diversity. The MDAR, in particular, is inconsistent with the observed trend between rotation curve shape and baryonic importance; either the trend is caused by systematic errors in the data or the MDAR does not apply. The origin of the dwarf galaxy rotation curve diversity and its relation to the structure of cold dark matter halos remains an open issue.},

Using a fully Lagrangian code based on the smooth particle hydrodynamics technique and a tree data structure, we follow the evolution of regions of comoving radius 2-3 Mpc with proper inclusion of the tidal effects of surrounding material. Initial conditions at high redshifts assume an Einstein-de Sitter universe, a biased cold dark matter perturbation spectrum (b = 2.5), and a baryonic mass fraction of 10 per cent. The gas is initially cold and radiates in the manner expected for a plasma of primordial composition. We neglect star formation and associated processes. We find that most of the gas settles rapidly into centrifugally supported discs at the centres of small dark matter clumps. These are not disrupted during later evolution, and survive the merging of their dark haloes. They either remain distinct, or merge without reheating at a later time. These results confirm that significant energy input from non-gravitational sources is required to produce a cold baryonic fraction consistent with the observed abundance of gas and stars in galaxies. In our simulations, much of the final disc of gas accumulates through mergers of dense clumps rather than through the smooth infall envisaged in earlier models. This process involves substantial angular momentum loss and large collapse factors. It produces discs that are more concentrated than real spiral discs and have circular velocities up to 70 per cent greater than that of the surrounding halo. Nevertheless, the surface density profile of these discs can be reasonably well fitted by an exponential, and their rotation curves are flat out to {\textasciitilde} 5 disc scalelengths. The high efficiency of cooling also results in very low predicted X-ray luminosities for the residual haloes of hot gas.},

	abstract = {(Abridged) We use N-body simulations to study the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) driven by galactic tides. We adopt a cosmologically-motivated model where dSphs are approximated by a King model embedded within an NFW halo. We find that these NFW-embedded King models are extraordinarily resilient to tides; the stellar density profile still resembles a King model even after losing more than 99\% of the stars. As tides strip the galaxy, the stellar luminosity, velocity dispersion, central surface brightness, and core radius decrease monotonically. Remarkably, we find that the evolution of these parameters is solely controlled by the total amount of mass lost from within the luminous radius. Of all parameters, the core radius is the least affected: after losing 99\% of the stars, R\_c decreases by just a factor of {\textasciitilde}2. Interestingly, tides tend to make dSphs more dark-matter dominated because the tightly bound central dark matter ``cusp'' is more resilient to disruption than the ``cored'' King profile. We examine whether the extremely large M/L ratios of the newly-discovered ultra-faint dSphs might have been caused by tidal stripping of once brighter systems. Although dSph tidal evolutionary tracks parallel the observed scaling relations in the luminosity-radius plane, they predict too steep a change in velocity dispersion compared with the observational estimates hitherto reported in the literature. The ultra-faint dwarfs are thus unlikely to be the tidal remnants of systems like Fornax, Draco, or Sagittarius. Despite spanning four decades in luminosity, dSphs appear to inhabit halos of comparable peak circular velocity, lending support to scenarios that envision dwarf spheroidals as able to form only in halos above a certain mass threshold.},

	abstract = {We present the first results of a spectroscopic survey of Lyman break galaxies in the near-infrared aimed at detecting the emission lines of [O II], [O III], and Hbeta from the H II regions of star forming galaxies at z = 3. From observations of 19 objects with the Keck and VLT telescopes, we reach the following main conclusions. Contrary to expectations, the star formation rates deduced from the Hbeta luminosity are on average no larger than those implied by the stellar continuum at 1500 A; presumably any differential extinction between rest-frame optical and UV is small compared with the relative uncertainties in the calibrations of these two star formation tracers. For the galaxies in our sample, the abundance of O can only be determined to within one order of magnitude. Even so, it seems well established that LBGs are the most metal-enriched structures at z = 3, apart from QSOs, with abundances greater than about 1/10 solar. They are also significantly overluminous for their metallicities; this is probably an indication that their mass-to-light ratios are small compared with present-day galaxies. At face value their velocity dispersions, sigma = 50 - 115 km/s imply virial masses of about 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} solar masses within half-light radii of 2.5 kpc. However, we are unable to establish if the widths of the emission lines do reflect the motions of the H II regions within the gravitational potential of the galaxies, even though in two cases we see hints of rotation curves. All 19 LBGs observed show evidence for galactic-scale superwinds; such outflows are important for regulating star formation, distributing metals over large volumes, and allowing Lyman continuum photons to escape and ionize the IGM.},

We focus in particular on the chemical abundances and kinematics of the interstellar gas and our main findings are as follows. Even at this relatively early epoch, the ISM of this galaxy is already highly enriched in elements released by Type II supernovae; the abundances of O, Mg, Si, P, and S are all about 2/5 of their solar values. In contrast, N and the Fe-peak elements Mn, Fe, and Ni are underabundant by a factor of about 3. Based on current ideas of stellar nucleosynthesis, these results can be understood if most of the metal enrichment in cB58 has taken place within the last 300 million years, the timescale for the release of N from intermediate mass stars. cB58 appears to be an example of a galaxy in the process of converting its gas into stars on a few dynamical timescales; quite possibly we are witnessing the formation of a galactic bulge or an elliptical galaxy. The energetic star formation activity has stirred the interstellar medium to high velocities of up to 1000 km/s. The net effect is a bulk outflow of the ISM at a speed of 255 km/s and at a rate which exceeds the star formation rate. It is unclear whether this gas will be lost or retained by the galaxy. We point out that the chemical and kinematic properties of cB58 are markedly different from those of most damped Lyman alpha systems at the same redshift.},

Focusing on VELOCIraptor catalogues for this work, we demonstrate how searching multiple snapshots spanning a dynamical time significantly reduces the number of stranded halos, those lacking a descendant or a progenitor, critically correcting poorly resolved halos. We present a new merit function that improves the distinction between primary and secondary progenitors, reducing tree pathologies.

We find a subhalo mass-radial distance dependence: large subhalos with mass ratios of \${\textbackslash}gtrsim10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ are more common in the central regions that smaller subhalos, a result of dynamical friction and low tidal mass loss rates. This dependence is completely absent in (sub)halo finders in common use, which generally search for substructure in configuration space, yet is present in codes that track particles belonging to halos as they fall into other halos, such as HBT+.

	abstract = {Linking the properties of galaxies to the assembly history of their dark matter haloes is a central aim of galaxy evolution theory. This paper introduces a dimensionless parameter \$s{\textbackslash}in[0,1]\$, the "tree entropy", to parametrise the geometry of a halo's entire mass assembly hierarchy, building on a generalisation of Shannon's information entropy. By construction, the minimum entropy (\$s=0\$) corresponds to smoothly assembled haloes without any mergers. In contrast, the highest entropy (\$s=1\$) represents haloes grown purely by equal-mass binary mergers. Using simulated merger trees extracted from the cosmological \$N\$-body simulation SURFS, we compute the natural distribution of \$s\$, a skewed bell curve peaking near \$s=0.4\$. This distribution exhibits weak dependences on halo mass \$M\$ and redshift \$z\$, which can be reduced to a single dependence on the relative peak height \${\textbackslash}delta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}/{\textbackslash}sigma(M,z)\$ in the matter perturbation field. By exploring the correlations between \$s\$ and global galaxy properties generated by the SHARK semi-analytic model, we find that \$s\$ contains a significant amount of information on the morphology of galaxies \$-\$ in fact more information than the spin, concentration and assembly time of the halo. Therefore, the tree entropy provides an information-rich link between galaxies and their dark matter haloes.},

R ProFit is also available pre-built from CRAN, however this version will be slightly behind the latest GitHub version. libprofit offers fast and accurate two- dimensional integration for a useful number of profiles, including Sersic, Core-Sersic, broken-exponential, Ferrer, Moffat, empirical King, point-source and sky, with a simple mechanism for adding new profiles. We show detailed comparisons between libprofit and GALFIT. libprofit is both faster and more accurate than GALFIT at integrating the ubiquitous Serrsic profile for the most common values of the Serrsic index n (0.5 {\textless} n {\textless} 8). The high-level fitting code ProFit is tested on a sample of galaxies with both SDSS and deeper KiDS imaging. We find good agreement in the fit parameters, with larger scatter in best-fit parameters from fitting images from different sources (SDSS vs KiDS) than from using different codes (ProFit vs GALFIT). A large suite of Monte Carlo-simulated images are used to assess prospects for automated bulge-disc decomposition with ProFit on SDSS, KiDS and future LSST imaging. We find that the biggest increases in fit quality come from moving from SDSS- to KiDS-quality data, with less significant gains moving from KiDS to LSST.},

	abstract = {Obtaining the set of cosmological parameters consistent with observational data is an important exercise in current cosmological research. It involves finding the global maximum of the likelihood function in the multi-dimensional parameter space. Currently sampling based methods, which are in general stochastic in nature, like Markov-Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC), are being commonly used for parameter estimation. The beauty of stochastic methods is that the computational cost grows, at the most, linearly in place of exponentially (as in grid based approaches) with the dimensionality of the search space. MCMC methods sample the full joint probability distribution (posterior) from which one and two dimensional probability distributions, best fit (average) values of parameters and then error bars can be computed. In the present work we demonstrate the application of another stochastic method, named Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), that is widely used in the field of engineering and artificial intelligence, for cosmological parameter estimation from WMAP seven years data. We find that there is a good agreement between the values of the best fit parameters obtained from PSO and publicly available code COSMOMC. However, there is a slight disagreement between error bars mainly due to the fact that errors are computed differently in PSO. Apart from presenting the results of our exercise, we also discuss the merits of PSO and explain its usefulness in more extensive search in higher dimensional parameter space.},

We find the equivalent faint end slope as previously estimated using the GAMA-I sample, although we find a higher value of \${\textbackslash}mathcal M{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}star\$. Using the full GAMA-II sample, we are able to fit the mass function to masses as low as \$10{\textasciicircum}\{7.5\}\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, and assess limits to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{6.5\}\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Combining GAMA-II with data from G10-COSMOS we are able to comment qualitatively on the shape of the GSMF down to masses as low as \$10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}\$ \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Beyond the well known upturn seen in the GSMF at \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}\$ the distribution appears to maintain a single power-law slope from \$10{\textasciicircum}9\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{6.5\}\$.

We carefully tally all apsis points and use them to distinguish haloes that are infalling for the first time from those that occupy more evolved orbits. We find that roughly 21 per cent of subhaloes within a host's virial radius are currently on first infall, and have not yet reached their first orbital pericentre; roughly 44 per cent are still approaching their first apocentre after infall. For the range of host masses studied, roughly half of all accreted systems were pre-processed prior to infall, and about 20 per cent were accreted in groups. We confirm that the entire population of accreted subhaloes -- often referred to as "associated" subhaloes -- extend far beyond the virial radii of their hosts, with roughly half currently residing at distances that exceed \${\textbackslash}approx 1.2{\textbackslash}times r\_\{200\}\$. Many of these backsplash haloes have gained orbital energy since infall, and occupy extreme orbits that carry them well past their initial turnaround radii. Such extreme orbits are created during the initial accretion and dissolution of loosely bound groups, but also through penetrating encounters between subhaloes on subsequent orbits. The same processes may also give rise to unexpectedly abrupt losses of orbital energy. These effects combine, giving rise to a large variation in the ratio of sequent apocentres for accreted systems. We find that, within 2 virial radii from host centres, the concentrations of first-infall halos are remarkably similar those of isolated field halos, whereas backsplash haloes, as well as systems that were pre-processed, are considerably more concentrated.},

	abstract = {The initial orbits of infalling subhalos largely determine the subsequent evolution of the subhalos and satellite galaxies therein and shed light on the assembly of their hosts. Using a large set of cosmological simulations of various resolutions, we quantify the orbital distribution of subhalos at infall time and its mass and redshift dependence in a large dynamic range. We further provide a unified and accurate model validated across cosmic time, which can serve as the initial condition for semi-analytic models. We find that the infall velocity \$v\$ follows a universal distribution peaked near the host virial velocity \$V\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{h\}\}\$ for any subhalo mass or redshift, while the infall orbit is most radially biased when \$v{\textbackslash}sim V\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{h\}\}\$. Moreover, subhalos that have a higher host mass or a higher sub-to-host ratio tend to move along a more radial direction with a relatively smaller angular momentum than their low host mass or low sub-to-host ratio counterparts, though they share the same normalized orbital energy. These relations are nearly independent of the redshift and very likely the cosmology when using the density peak height as the proxy for host halo mass. The above trends are consistent with the scenario where the dynamical environment is relatively colder for more massive structures because their own gravity is more likely to dominate the local potentials. In addition, the external tidal fields seem to affect more the orbit direction rather than the amplitude of the velocity.},

The HIMF is fitted with a Schechter function with parameters: alpha=-1.37 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.05, log (M\_HI/M\_sun=9.80 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.03, and theta*=(6.0 +/- 0.8 +/- 0.6) x 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-3\} (random and systematic uncertainties at 68\% CL, H0=75), in good agreement with calculations based on the HIPASS Bright Galaxy Catalogue, which is a complete, but smaller, sub-sample of galaxies. The cosmological mass density of HI in the local universe is found to be Omega\_HI=(3.5 +/- 0.4 +/- 0.4) x 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}. This large homogeneous sample allows us to test whether the shape of the HIMF depends on local galaxy density. We find tentative evidence for environmental effects in the sense that the HIMF becomes steeper toward higher density regions, ranging from alpha {\textasciitilde} -1.2 in the lowest density environments to alpha {\textasciitilde} -1.5 in the highest density environments probed by this blind HI survey. This effect appears stronger when densities are measured on larger scales.},

Using the analytic form of this fit we investigate the total stellar mass accreting onto more massive galaxies across all mass ratios. Depending on how conservatively we select our robust merging systems, the fraction of mass merging onto more massive companions is 2.0\%-5.6\%. Using the GAMA-II data we see no significant evidence for a change in the close-pair fraction between redshift \$z = 0.05-0.2\$. However, we find a systematically higher fraction of galaxies in similar mass close-pairs compared to published results over a similar redshift baseline. Using a compendium of data and the function \${\textbackslash}gamma\_M =A(1+z)m\$ to predict the major close-pair fraction, we find fitting parameters of \$A = 0.021 {\textbackslash}pm 0.001\$ and \$m = 1.53 {\textbackslash}pm 0.08\$, which represents a higher low-redshift normalisation and shallower power-law slope than recent literature values. We find that the relative importance of in-situ star-formation versus galaxy merging is inversely correlated, with star-formation dominating the addition of stellar material below Mstar and merger accretion events dominating beyond Mstar. We find mergers have a measurable impact on the whole extent of the GSMF, manifest as a deepening of the dip in the GSMF over the next Gyr and an increase in Mstar by as much as 0.01-0.05 dex.},

Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple ``universal'' profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than \$r{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ near the center and steeper than \$r{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of halo mass, of initial density fluctuation spectrum, and of the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fit over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, which allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

One open question, in particular, is the effect of major mergers on halo structure. We have performed a large set of simulations of binary equal-mass mergers between isolated haloes with various density profiles, to map out the relationship between the initial conditions and merger parameters and the structure of the final remnant. In this paper we describe our initial set-up and analysis methods, and report on the results for the size, shape, and spin of the merger remnant. The outcomes of mergers are most easily understood in terms of a scaled dimensionless energy parameter \${\textbackslash}kappa\$ and an angular momentum (or spin) parameter \${\textbackslash}lambda\$. We find that the axis ratio \$c/a\$ scales roughly linearly with energy \${\textbackslash}kappa\$ while the axis ratio \$c/b\$ scales linearly with spin \${\textbackslash}lambda\$. Qualitatively, mergers on radial orbits produce prolate remnants, while mergers on tangential orbits produce oblate remnants. The spin of the remnant can be predicted from angular momentum conservation, while the overall size changes as \${\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}kappa{\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$, as expected from self-similar scaling at constant mean density. We discuss potential cosmological applications for these simple patterns.},

We use HST grism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields, more than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine these data with Keck MOSFIRE and NIRSPEC spectroscopy. We first confirm that a population of massive, compact, star forming galaxies exists at z{\textasciitilde}2, using K-band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0{\textless}z{\textless}2.5. They have a median NII/Halpha ratio of 0.6, are highly obscured with SFR(tot)/SFR(Halpha){\textasciitilde}10, and have a large range of observed line widths. We infer from the kinematics and spatial distribution of Halpha that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionized gas that are a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 more extended than the stellar distribution. By combining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics are consistent with a nearly Keplerian fall-off from V\_rot{\textasciitilde}500 km/s at 1 kpc to V\_rot{\textasciitilde}250 km/s at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius is dominated by the dense stellar component. Next, we study the size and mass evolution of the progenitors of compact massive galaxies. Even though individual galaxies may have had complex histories with periods of compaction and mergers, we show that the population of progenitors likely followed a simple inside-out growth track in the size-mass plane of d(log r\_e) {\textasciitilde} 0.3 d(log M\_stars). This mode of growth gradually increases the stellar mass within a fixed physical radius, and galaxies quench when they reach a stellar density or velocity dispersion threshold. As shown in other studies, the mode of growth changes after quenching, as dry mergers take the galaxies on a relatively steep track in the size-mass plane.},

We find the choice of division between early and late (i.e., colour, shape, morphology) is not particularly critical, however, the adopted mass limits and sample selections (i.e., the careful rejection of outliers and use of robust fitting methods) are important. In particular we note that for samples extending to low stellar mass limits (\${\textless}10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$) the S{\textbackslash}'ersic index bimodality, evident for high mass systems, becomes less distinct and no-longer acts as a reliable separator of early- and late-type systems. The final set of stellar mass \$-\$ half-light radius relations are reported for a variety of galaxy population subsets in 10 bands (\$ugrizZYJHK\_s\$) and are intended to provide a comprehensive low-z benchmark for the many ongoing high-z studies. Exploring the variation of the stellar mass \$-\$ half-light radius relations with wavelength we confirm earlier findings that galaxies appear more compact at longer wavelengths albeit at a smaller level than previously noted: at \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$ both spiral systems and ellipticals show a decrease in size of 13\% from \$g\$ to \$K\_s\$ (which is near linear in log wavelength).

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive method for determining stellar mass functions, and apply it to samples in the local Universe. We combine the classical 1/Vmax approach with STY, a parametric maximum likelihood method and SWML, a non-parametric maximum likelihood technique. In the parametric approach, we are assuming that the stellar mass function can be modelled by either a single or a double Schechter function and we use a likelihood ratio test to determine which model provides a better fit to the data. We discuss how the stellar mass completeness as a function of z biases the three estimators and how it can affect, especially the low mass end of the stellar mass function. We apply our method to SDSS DR7 data in the redshift range from 0.02 to 0.06.

The large SDSS database provides statistics of unprecedented accuracy. For each type of galaxy, the size distribution at given luminosity (or stellar mass) is well described by a log-normal function, characterized by its median \${\textbackslash}bar\{R\}\$ and dispersion \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}ln R\}\$. For late-type galaxies, there is a characteristic luminosity at \$M\_\{r,0\}{\textbackslash}sim -20.5\$ (assuming \$h=0.7\$) corresponding to a stellar mass \$M\_0{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.6\}{\textbackslash}Msun\$. Galaxies more massive than \$M\_0\$ have \${\textbackslash}bar\{R\}{\textbackslash}propto M{\textasciicircum}\{0.4\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}ln R\}{\textbackslash}sim 0.3\$, while less massive galaxies have \${\textbackslash}bar\{R\}{\textbackslash}propto M{\textasciicircum}\{0.15\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}ln R\}{\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$. For early-type galaxies, the \${\textbackslash}bar\{R\}\$ - \$M\$ relation is significantly steeper, \${\textbackslash}bar\{R\}{\textbackslash}propto M{\textasciicircum}\{0.55\}\$, but the \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}ln R\}\$ - \$M\$ relation is similar to that of late-type galaxies.

In the present-day universe star-forming galaxies of all masses 1e9 - 1e11 Msol are predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies. We now extend this to higher redshifts, and find that among massive galaxies (M* {\textgreater} 1e10 Msol) disks are the most common geometric shape at all z {\textless} 2. Lower-mass galaxies at z{\textgreater}1 possess a broad range of geometric shapes: the fraction of elongated (prolate) galaxies increases toward higher redshifts and lower masses. Galaxies with stellar mass 1e9 Msol (1e10 Msol) are a mix of roughly equal numbers of elongated and disk galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}1 (z{\textasciitilde}2). This suggests that galaxies in this mass range do not yet have disks that are sustained over many orbital periods, implying that galaxies with present-day stellar mass comparable to that of the Milky Way typically first formed such sustained stellar disks at redshift z{\textasciitilde}1.5-2. Combined with constraints on the evolution of the star formation rate density and the distribution of star formation over galaxies with different masses, our findings imply that, averaged over cosmic time, the majority of stars formed in disks.},

We test several implementations of the dependence of the mass loading due to supernovae (SNe). We find that no evolution in the normalization of the MZR is obtained unless we introduce an explicit scaling of the reheated and ejected mass with redshift as \$(1+z){\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}beta\$. The latter is in agreement with results from the FIRE simulations, and it should encompass small scale properties of the interstellar medium varying over time, which are not captured in SAMs, as well as other energy sources in addition to SNe. Increasing \${\textbackslash}beta\$ leads to stronger evolution of the MZR normalization; \${\textbackslash}beta = 1.9\$ reproduces the observed MZR in the range \$0 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5\$. A stronger redshift dependence of outflows reduces the levels of star formation at earlier epochs with the consequent decrease of metal production. This leads to a slower increase of the gas metallicity compared to the stellar mass build-up. The cold gas can be contaminated either by receiving a direct injection of the material recycled by stellar winds and SNe or by gas cooling. The relative role of each process for a given stellar mass depends on the criterion adopted to regulate the fate of the recycled material. However, modifying the metal loading of the outflows has mild impact on the zero-point evolution and does not affect our conclusions.},

	abstract = {We present a new version of the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. This brings together several previous developments of GALFORM into a single unified model, including a different initial mass function (IMF) in quiescent star formation and in starbursts, feedback from active galactic nuclei supressing gas cooling in massive halos, and a new empirical star formation law in galaxy disks based on their molecular gas content. In addition, we have updated the cosmology, introduced a more accurate treatment of dynamical friction acting on satellite galaxies, and updated the stellar population model. The new model is able to simultaneously explain both the observed evolution of the K-band luminosity function and stellar mass function, and the number counts and redshift distribution of sub-mm galaxies selected at 850 mu. This was not previously achieved by a single physical model within the LambdaCDM framework, but requires having an IMF in starbursts that is somewhat top-heavy. The new model is tested against a wide variety of observational data covering wavelengths from the far-UV to sub-mm, and redshifts from z=0 to z=6, and is found to be generally successful. These observations include the optical and near-IR luminosity functions, HI mass function, fraction of early type galaxies, Tully-Fisher, metallicity-luminosity and size-luminosity relations at z=0, as well as far-IR number counts, and far-UV luminosity functions at z {\textasciitilde} 3-6.

	abstract = {Modern observational and analytic techniques now enable the direct measurement of star formation histories and the inference of galaxy assembly histories. However, current theoretical predictions of assembly are not ideally suited for direct comparison with such observational data. We therefore extend the work of prior examinations of the contribution of ex-situ stars to the stellar mass budget of simulated galaxies. Our predictions are specifically tailored for direct testing with a new generation of observational techniques by calculating ex-situ fractions as functions of galaxy mass and morphological type, for a range of surface brightnesses. These enable comparison with results from large FoV IFU spectrographs, and increasingly accurate spectral fitting, providing a look-up method for the estimated accreted fraction. We furthermore provide predictions of ex-situ mass fractions as functions of galaxy mass, galactocentric radius and environment. Using \$z=0\$ snapshots from the 100cMpc\${\textasciicircum}3\$ and 25cMpc\${\textasciicircum}3\$ EAGLE simulations we corroborate the findings of prior studies, finding that ex-situ fraction increases with stellar mass for central and satellite galaxies in a stellar mass range of 2\${\textbackslash}times\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$ - 1.9\${\textbackslash}times\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. For those galaxies of mass M\$\_*\${\textgreater}5\${\textbackslash}times\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{8\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, we find that the total ex-situ mass fraction is greater for more extended galaxies at fixed mass. When categorising satellite galaxies by their parent group/cluster halo mass we find that the ex-situ fraction decreases with increasing parent halo mass at fixed galaxy mass. This apparently counter-intuitive result may be the result of high passing velocities within large cluster halos inhibiting efficient accretion onto individual galaxies.},

We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z=1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a {\textasciitilde}30\% increase in the number density of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun galaxies since z{\textasciitilde}0.6, and a {\textless}10\% change in the number density of all {\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun galaxies since z{\textasciitilde}1.

Meanwhile, the number density of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun quiescent galaxies increases steeply towards low redshift, by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2-3 since z{\textasciitilde}0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z{\textasciitilde}1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}10.8 Msun. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z{\textless}1, even among massive ({\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun) quiescent galaxies.},

Sources have been selected from the DR1 UltraVISTA K\_\{s\}-band imaging which covers a unique combination of a wide area (1.62 deg{\textasciicircum}2), to a significant depth (K\_\{s,tot\} = 23.4). The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50\%, 10\% and 1\% of its current value at z {\textasciitilde} 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing by 2.71{\textasciicircum}\{+0.93\}\_\{-0.22\} dex since z = 3.5. At z {\textgreater} 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a nonzero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the K\_\{s\}-selected star-forming galaxy SMFs to UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4 show reasonable agreement and suggests UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z {\textgreater} 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with Log(M\_\{*\}/M\_\{sun\}) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0(3.5), whereas those with Log(M\_\{*\}/M\_\{sun\}) = 10.5 have grown by {\textgreater} 1.0 dex since z = 2. At z {\textless} 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties on the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates, SPS modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.},

Deep WFC3 near-IR data (for Y as faint as 27.3, J and H as faint as 27.4 AB mag at 5 sigma), as well as deep Ks (as faint as 25.5 at 5 sigma) Hawk-I band data, provide an exquisite data set with which determine in an unprecedented way the low-mass end of the GSMF, allowing an accurate probe of masses as low as M{\textasciitilde}7.6 10{\textasciicircum}9 Msun at z{\textasciitilde}3. Although the area used is relatively small ({\textasciitilde}33 arcmin{\textasciicircum}2), we found generally good agreement with previous studies on the entire mass range. Our results show that the slope of the faint-end increases with redshift, from alpha=-1.44+/-0.03 at z{\textasciitilde}0.8 to alpha=-1.86+/-0.16 at z{\textasciitilde}3, although indications exist that it does not steepen further between z{\textasciitilde}3 and z{\textasciitilde}4. This result is insensitive to any uncertainty in the M* parameter. The steepness of the GSMF faint-end solves the well-known disagreement between the stellar mass density (SMD) and the integrated star formation history at z{\textgreater}2. However, we confirm the that there appears to be an excess of integrated star formation with respect to the SMD at z{\textless}2, by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2-3. Our comparison of the observations with theoretical predictions shows that the models forecast a greater abundance of low mass galaxies, at least up to z{\textasciitilde}3, as well as a dearth of massive galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}4 with respect to the data, and that the predicted SMD is generally overestimated at z{\textless}{\textasciitilde}2.},

Our model includes a specific treatment for the angular momentum exchange between different galactic components. Disk scale radii are estimated from the angular momentum of the gaseous/stellar disk, while bulge sizes are estimated assuming energy conservation. The predicted size--mass and angular momentum--mass relations are in fair agreement with observational measurements in the local Universe, provided a treatment for gas dissipation during major mergers is included. Our treatment for disk instability leads to unrealistically small radii of bulges formed through this channel, and predicts an offset between the size--mass relations of central and satellite early-type galaxies, that is not observed. The model reproduces the observed dependence of the size--mass relation on morphology, and predicts a strong correlation between specific angular momentum and cold gas content. This correlation is a natural consequence of galaxy evolution: gas-rich galaxies reside in smaller halos, and form stars gradually until present day, while gas-poor ones reside in massive halos, that formed most of their stars at early epochs, when the angular momentum of their parent halos is low. The dynamical and structural properties of galaxies can be strongly affected by a different treatment for stellar feedback, as this would modify their star formation history. A higher angular momentum for gas accreted through rapid mode does not affect significantly the properties of massive galaxies today, but has a more important effect on low-mass galaxies at higher redshift.},

To achieve robust profile measurements we use a novel approach of repeatedly fitting the galaxies, varying the input parameters to sample a large fraction of the input parameter space. Using this method we reduce the catastrophic failure rate significantly and verify the confidence in the fit independently of \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$. Additionally, using the median of the final fitting values and the 16\${\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$ and 84\${\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$ percentile produces more realistic error estimates than those provided by GALFIT, which are known to be underestimated. We use the results of our decompositions to analyse the stellar mass - half-light radius relations of bulges, discs and spheroids. We further investigate the association of components with a parent disc or elliptical relation to provide definite \$z=0\$ disc and spheroid \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\_{\textbackslash}star\}-R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\$ relations. We conclude by comparing our local disc and spheroid \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\_{\textbackslash}star\}-R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}\$ to simulated data from EAGLE and high redshift data from CANDELS-UDS. We show the potential of using the mass-size relation to study galaxy evolution in both cases but caution that for a fair comparison all data sets need to be processed and analysed in the same manner.},

	abstract = {The quasar mode of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the high-redshift Universe is routinely observed in gas-rich galaxies together with large-scale AGN-driven winds. It is crucial to understand how photons emitted by the central AGN source couple to the ambient interstellar-medium to trigger large-scale outflows. By means of radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of idealised galactic discs, we study the coupling of photons with the multiphase galactic gas, and how it varies with gas cloud sizes, and the radiation bands included in the simulations, which are ultraviolet (UV), optical, and infrared (IR). We show how a quasar with a luminosity of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{46\}\$ erg/s can drive large-scale winds with velocities of \$10{\textasciicircum}2-10{\textasciicircum}3\$ km/s and mass outflow rates around \$10{\textasciicircum}3\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$/yr for times of order a few million years. Infrared radiation is necessary to efficiently transfer momentum to the gas via multi-scattering on dust in dense clouds. However, IR multi-scattering, despite being extremely important at early times, quickly declines as the central gas cloud expands and breaks up, allowing the radiation to escape through low gas density channels. The typical number of multi-scattering events for an IR photon is only about a quarter of the mean optical depth from the center of the cloud. Our models account for the observed outflow rates of \${\textbackslash}sim\$500-1000 M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$/yr and high velocities of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}3\$ km/s, favouring winds that are energy-driven via extremely fast nuclear outflows, interpreted here as being IR-radiatively-driven winds.},

Adopting the dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way as a laboratory, we explore a flexible semi-analytic galaxy formation model to understand how the feedback processes shape the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Using Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, we exhaustively search a large parameter space of the model and rigorously show that the general wisdom of strong outflows as the primary feedback mechanism cannot simultaneously explain the stellar mass function and the mass--metallicity relation of the Milky Way satellites. An extended model that assumes that a fraction of baryons is prevented from collapsing into low-mass halos in the first place can be accurately constrained to simultaneously reproduce those observations. The inference suggests that two different physical mechanisms are needed to explain the two different data sets. In particular, moderate outflows with weak halo mass dependence are needed to explain the mass--metallicity relation, and prevention of baryons falling into shallow gravitational potentials of low-mass halos (e.g. "pre-heating") is needed to explain the low stellar mass fraction for a given subhalo mass.},

We find that the sizes increase with stellar mass , but that the relation weakens with increasing redshift. Separating galaxies by their star formation activity, we find that passive galaxies are typically smaller than active galaxies at fixed stellar mass. These trends are consistent with those found in observations and the level of agreement between the predicted and observed size - mass relation is of order 0.1 dex for z {\textless} 1 and 0.2-0.3 dex from redshift 1 to 2. We use the simulation to compare the evolution of individual galaxies to that of the population as a whole. While the evolution of the size-stellar mass relation for active galaxies provides a good proxy for the evolution of individual galaxies, the evolution of individual passive galaxies is not well represented by the observed size - mass relation due to the evolving number density of passive galaxies. Observations of z {\textbackslash}approx 2 galaxies have revealed an abundance of massive red compact galaxies, that depletes below z {\textbackslash}approx 1. We find that a similar population forms naturally in the simulation. Comparing these galaxies to their z = 0 descendants, we find that all compact galaxies grow in size due to the high-redshift stars migrating outwards. Approximately 60\% of the compact galaxies increase in size further due to renewed star formation and/or mergers.},

	abstract = {Present-day multi-wavelength deep imaging surveys allow to characterise the outskirts of galaxies with unprecedented precision. Taking advantage of this situation, we define a new physically motivated measurement of size for galaxies based on the expected location of the gas density threshold for star formation. Employing both theoretical and observational arguments, we use the stellar mass density contour at 1 \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}odot\}\$ pc\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ as a proxy for this density threshold for star formation. This choice makes our size definition operative. With this new size measure, the intrinsic scatter of the global stellar mass (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}star\}\$) - size relation (explored over five orders of magnitude in stellar mass) decreases to \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.06 dex. This value is 2.5 times smaller than the scatter measured using the effective radius (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.15 dex) and between 1.5 and 1.8 times smaller than those using other traditional size indicators such as \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 23.5,i\}\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.09 dex), the Holmberg radius \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.09 dex) and the half-mass radius \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e,M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\}\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.11 dex). Moreover, galaxies with 10\${\textasciicircum}7\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}odot\} {\textless}\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}odot\}\$ increase monotonically in size following a power-law with a slope very close to 1/3, equivalent to an average stellar mass 3D density of \${\textbackslash}sim\$4.5\${\textbackslash}times\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}odot\}\$ pc\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ for galaxies within this mass range. Galaxies with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}star\}\$\${\textgreater}\$10\${\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}odot\}\$ show a different slope with stellar mass, which is suggestive of a larger gas density threshold for star formation at the epoch when their star formation peaks.},

We identify the IHSC using an improved phase-space galaxy finder algorithm which provides an adaptive, physically motivated and shape-independent definition of this stellar component, that can be applied to halos of arbitrary masses. We explore the IHSC mass fraction-total halo's stellar mass, \$f\_\{M*,IHSC\}-M*\$, relation and the physical drivers of its scatter. We find that on average the \$f\_\{M*,IHSC\}\$ increases with \$M\_\{*,tot\}\$, with the scatter decreasing strongly with mass from 2 dex at \$M\_\{*,tot\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ to 0.3 dex at group masses. At high masses, \$M\_\{*,tot\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, \$f\_\{M*,IHSC\}\$ increases with the number of substructures, and with the mass ratio between the central galaxy and largest satellite, at fixed \$M\_\{*,tot\}\$. From mid-size groups and systems below \$M\_\{*,tot\}{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, we find that the central galaxy's stellar rotation-to-dispersion velocity ratio, V/\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}, displays the strongest (anti)-correlation with \$f\_\{M*,IHSC\}\$ at fixed \$M\_\{*,tot\}\$ of all the galaxy and halo properties explored, transitioning from \$f\_\{M*,IHSC\}\${\textless}0.1\% for high V/\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}, to \$f\_\{M*,IHSC\}{\textbackslash}sim5\$\% for low V/\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} galaxies. By studying the \$f\_\{M*,IHSC\}\$ temporal evolution, we find that, in the former, mergers not always take place, but if they did, they happened early (z{\textgreater}1), while the high \$f\_\{M*,IHSC\}\$ population displays a much more active merger history. In the case of massive groups and galaxy clusters, \$M\_\{*,tot\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, a fraction \$f\_\{M*,IHSC\}{\textbackslash}sim\$10-20\% is reached at \$z{\textbackslash}sim1\$ and then they evolve across lines of constant \$f\_\{M*,IHSC\}\$ modulo some small perturbations.

Those stars do not trace the extended distribution of dark matter well as they are located in the central regions of the cluster's dark matter sub-halos. A small fraction of stars is expected, however, to follow the global dark matter shape of the cluster. These are the stars whose extended spatial distribution results from the merging activity of galaxies and form the intracluster light (ICL). In this work, we compare the bi-dimensional distribution of dark matter in massive galaxy clusters (as traced by gravitational lensing models) with the distribution of the ICL. To do that, we use the superb data from the Hubble Frontier Fields Initiative. Using the Modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) as a way of quantifying the similarities between the mass and ICL distributions, we find an excellent agreement (MHD{\textasciitilde}25 kpc) between the two components. This result shows that the ICL exquisitely follows the global dark matter distribution, providing an accurate luminous tracer of dark matter. This finding opens up the possibility of exploring the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters in detail using only deep imaging observations.},

We assume that the ICL forms by (1) stellar stripping of satellite galaxies and (2) relaxation processes that take place during galaxy mergers. The fraction of ICL in groups and clusters predicted by our models ranges between 10 and 40 per cent, with a large halo-to-halo scatter and no halo mass dependence. We note, however, that our predicted ICL fractions depend on the resolution: for a set of simulations with particle mass one order of magnitude larger than that adopted in the high resolution runs used in our study, we find that the predicted ICL fractions are {\textasciitilde}30-40 per cent larger than those found in the high resolution runs. On cluster scale, large part of the scatter is due to a range of dynamical histories, while on smaller scale it is driven by individual accretion events and stripping of very massive satellites, \$M\_\{*\} {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, that we find to be the major contributors to the ICL. The ICL in our models forms very late (below \$z{\textbackslash}sim 1\$), and a fraction varying between 5 and 25 per cent of it has been accreted during the hierarchical growth of haloes. In agreement with recent observational measurements, we find the ICL to be made of stars covering a relatively large range of metallicity, with the bulk of them being sub-solar.},

One method is based on a dynamical analysis of the stellar component. The second method is closer to techniques commonly employed in observational studies. Both the dynamical method and the method based on the surface brightness limit criterion are applied to the same set of hydrodynamical simulations for a large sample about 80 galaxy clusters. We find significant differences between the ICL and DSC fractions computed with the two corresponding methods, which amounts to about a factor of two for the AGN simulations, and a factor of four for the CSF set. We also find that the inclusion of AGN feedback boosts the DSC and ICL fractions by a factor of 1.5-2, respectively, while leaving the BCG+ICL and BCG+DSC mass fraction almost unchanged. The sum of the BCG and DSC mass stellar mass fraction is found to decrease from {\textasciitilde}80 per cent in galaxy groups to {\textasciitilde}60 per cent in rich clusters, thus in excess of what found from observational analysis. We identify the average surface brightness limits that yields the ICL fraction from the SBL method close to the DSC fraction from the dynamical method. These surface brightness limits turn out to be brighter in the CSF than in the AGN simulations. This is consistent with the finding that AGN feedback makes BCGs to be less massive and with shallower density profiles than in the CSF simulations. The BCG stellar component, as identified by both methods, are slightly older and more metal-rich than the stars in the diffuse component.},

Reproducing the observed luminosity dependence of the galaxy two-point correlation function results in average mass-to-light ratios that are about 35 percent lower than in a LCDM cosmology with Omega\_m=0.3 and sigma\_8=0.9 (hereafter WMAP1 cosmology). This removes an important problem with previous halo occupation models which had a tendency to predict cluster mass-to-light ratios that were too high. For the WMAP3 cosmology our model yields average mass-to-light ratios, central galaxy luminosities, halo occupation numbers, satellite fractions, and luminosity-gap statistics, that are all in excellent agreement with those obtained from a 2dFGRS group catalogue and from other independent studies. We also use our CLF model to compute the probability distribution P(M{\textbar}L\_cen), that a central galaxy of luminosity L\_cen resides in a halo of mass M. We find this distribution to be much broader than what is typically assumed in HOD models, which has important implications for the interpretation of galaxy-galaxy lensing data. Finally, reproducing the luminosity dependence of the pairwise velocity dispersions in the 2dFGRS requires relatively low mass-to-light ratios for clusters and a satellite fraction that decreases strongly with increasing luminosity. This is only marginally consistent with our CLF constraints. We argue that a cosmology with parameters between those of the WMAP1 and WMAP3 cosmologies is likely to yield results with a higher level of consistency.},

	abstract = {We use a statistical approach to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of the dark matter halos in which they reside. We obtain a parameterized stellar-to-halo mass (SHM) relation by populating halos and subhalos in an N-body simulation with galaxies and requiring that the observed stellar mass function be reproduced. We find good agreement with constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and predictions of semi-analytic models. Using this mapping, and the positions of the halos and subhalos obtained from the simulation, we find that our model predictions for the galaxy two-point correlation function (CF) as a function of stellar mass are in excellent agreement with the observed clustering properties in the SDSS at z=0. We show that the clustering data do not provide additional strong constraints on the SHM function and conclude that our model can therefore predict clustering as a function of stellar mass. We compute the conditional mass function, which yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses in the range [m, m+dm] that reside in a halo of mass M. We study the redshift dependence of the SHM relation and show that, for low mass halos, the SHM ratio is lower at higher redshift. The derived SHM relation is used to predict the stellar mass dependent galaxy CF and bias at high redshift. Our model predicts that not only are massive galaxies more biased than low mass ones at all redshifts, but the bias increases more rapidly with increasing redshift for massive galaxies than for low mass ones. We present convenient fitting functions for the SHM relation as a function of redshift, the conditional mass function, and the bias as a function of stellar mass and redshift.},

We use an extensively-tested analytic model for subhalo infall and evolution and empirical constraints from galaxy survey data to set the stellar mass in each accreted subhalo to model diffuse light. We add stellar mass to the diffuse light as subhalos become disrupted due to interactions within their host halos. We predict that the stellar mass fraction in diffuse, intrahalo light should rise on average from {\textasciitilde}0.5\% to approximately 20\% from small galaxy halos to poor groups. The trend with mass flattens considerably beyond the group scale, increasing weakly from a fraction of {\textasciitilde}20\% in poor galaxy clusters ({\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}14 M\_sun) to roughly {\textasciitilde}30\% in massive clusters ({\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}15 M\_sun). The mass-dependent diffuse light fraction is governed primarily by the empirical fact that the mass-to-light ratio in galaxy halos must vary as a function of halo mass. Galaxy halos have little diffuse light because they accrete most of their mass in small subhalos that themselves have high mass-to-light ratios; stellar halos around galaxies are built primarily from disrupted dwarf-irregular-type galaxies with M*{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8.5 M\_sun. The diffuse light in group and cluster halos is built from satellite galaxies that form stars efficiently and have correspondingly low mass-to-light ratios; intracluster light is dominated by material liberated from massive galaxies with M*{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_sun. Our results are consistent with existing observations spanning the galaxy, group, and cluster scale; however, they can be tested more rigorously in future deep surveys for faint diffuse light.},

	abstract = {We investigate the subhalo populations of dark matter haloes in the concordance cold dark matter ( CDM) cosmology. We use a large cosmological simulation and a variety of highresolution resimulations of individual cluster and galaxy haloes to study the systematics of subhalo populations over ranges of 1000 in halo mass and 1000 in the ratio of subhalo to parent halo mass. The subhalo populations of different haloes are not scaled copies of each other, but vary systematically with halo properties. On average, the amount of substructure increases with halo mass. At ﬁxed mass, it decreases with halo concentration and with halo formation redshift. These trends are comparable in size to the scatter in subhalo abundance between similar haloes. Averaged over all haloes of given mass, the abundance of low-mass subhaloes per unit parent halo mass is independent of parent mass. It is very similar to the abundance per unit mass of low-mass haloes in the Universe as a whole, once differing boundary deﬁnitions for subhaloes and haloes are accounted for. The radial distribution of subhaloes within their parent haloes is substantially less centrally concentrated than that of the dark matter. It varies at most weakly with the mass (or concentration) of the parent halo and not at all with subhalo mass. It does depend on the criteria used to deﬁne the subhalo population considered. About 90 per cent of present-day subhaloes were accreted after z = 1 and about 70 per cent after z = 0.5. Only about 8 per cent of the total mass of all haloes accreted at z = 1 survives as bound subhaloes at z = 0. For haloes accreted at z = 2, the survival mass fraction is just 2 per cent. Subhaloes seen near the centre of their parent typically were accreted earlier and retain less of their original mass than those seen near the edge. These strong systematics mean that comparison with galaxies in real clusters is only possible if the formation of the luminous component is modelled appropriately.},

Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates, and cosmic star formation rates from z=0 to z=8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, star formation rates, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z=8. We also provide new compilations of cosmic and specific star formation rates; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z {\textasciitilde} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z {\textasciitilde} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for star formation histories that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the star formation history of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in LCDM.

Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution from z=0 to z=4. The shape and evolution are well constrained for z {\textless} 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates; however, failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z=4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. These results will provide a powerful tool to inform galaxy evolution models. [Abridged]},

Surface photometry in the g, r and i bands is conducted on stacked images of the clusters, after rescaling them to the same metric size and masking out resolved sources. We are able to trace the average surface brightness profile of the ICL out to 700 kpc, where it is less than 1/10,000 of the mean surface brightness of the dark night sky. The ICL appears as a clear surface brightness excess with respect to an inner R{\textasciicircum}1/4 profile which characterises the mean profile of the BCG. The surface brightness (SB) of the ICL ranges from 27.5 mag/arcsec{\textasciicircum}2 at 100 kpc to roughly 32 at 700 kpc in the observed r-band (26.5 to 31 in the rest-frame g-band). We find that, on average, the ICL contributes only a small fraction of the total optical emission in a cluster (10.9+-5.0\% within 500 kpc). The radial distribution of the ICL is more centrally concentrated than that of the cluster galaxies, but the colours of the two components are identical within the statistical uncertainties. In the mean the ICL is aligned with and more flattened than the BCG itself. This alignment is substantially stronger than that of the cluster light as a whole. The SB of the ICL correlates both with BCG luminosity and with cluster richness, while the fraction of the total light in the ICL is almost independent of these quantities. These results support the idea that the ICL is produced by stripping and disruption of galaxies as they pass through the central regions of clusters. Our measurements of the diffuse light also constrain the faint-end slope of the cluster LF. Slopes alpha{\textless}-1.35 would imply more light from undetected galaxies than is observed in the diffuse component.},

The survey consists of wide field, deep (\${\textbackslash}mu\_\{g\} {\textgreater} 31\$ mag arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$) optical imaging of nearby galaxies using the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. Our sample includes eight spiral galaxies with stellar masses similar to that of the Milky Way, inclinations of \$16-90\$ degrees and distances between \$7-18\$ Mpc.

We find a mean halo fraction of \$0.009 {\textbackslash}pm 0.005\$ and a large RMS scatter of \$1.01{\textasciicircum}\{+0.9\}\_\{-0.26\}\$ dex. The peak-to-peak scatter is a factor of \${\textgreater}100\$ -- while some galaxies feature strongly structured halos resembling that of M31, three of the eight have halos that are completely undetected in our data. We conclude that spiral galaxies as a class exhibit a rich variety in stellar halo properties, implying that their assembly histories have been highly non-uniform.

We select red giant branch stars to derive stellar halo density profiles. The projected minor axis density profiles can be approximated by power laws with projected slopes of between \$-2\$ and \$-3.7\$ and a diversity of stellar halo masses of \$1-6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, or \$2-14{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total galaxy stellar masses. The typical intrinsic scatter around a smooth power law fit is \$0.05-0.1\$ dex owing to substructure. By comparing the minor and major axis profiles, we infer projected axis ratios \$c/a\$ at \${\textbackslash}sim 25\$ kpc between \$0.4-0.75\$. The GHOSTS stellar haloes are diverse, lying between the extremes charted out by the (rather atypical) haloes of the Milky Way and M31. We find a strong correlation between the stellar halo metallicities and the stellar halo masses. We compare our results with cosmological models, finding good agreement between our observations and accretion-only models where the stellar haloes are formed by the disruption of dwarf satellites. In particular, the strong observed correlation between stellar halo metallicity and mass is naturally reproduced. Low-resolution hydrodynamical models have unrealistically high stellar halo masses. Current high-resolution hydrodynamical models appear to predict stellar halo masses somewhat higher than observed but with reasonable metallicities, metallicity gradients and density profiles.},

We find that 5-20{\textbackslash}\% of the total stellar mass for the galaxies in our sample is contained within 10 \${\textless} R {\textless}\$ 50 kpc. These values are in close agreement with numerical simulations, and higher than those reported for local late-type galaxies (\${\textbackslash}lesssim\$5{\textbackslash}\%).

We employ a new method, which is free from any functional form of the ICL profile, and exploit the unprecedented depth of this Hubble Space Telescope imaging to map the ICL's diffuse light out to clustrocentric radii \$R{\textbackslash}sim300\$kpc (\${\textbackslash}mu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ICL\}{\textbackslash}sim27\$mag arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$). From these maps, we construct radial color and stellar mass profiles via SED fitting and find clear negative color gradients in all systems with increasing distance from the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). While this implies older/more metal rich stellar components in the inner part of the ICL, we find the ICL mostly consists of a \${\textless}2\$Gyr population, and plausibly originated with \${\textbackslash}log M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textless}10\$ cluster galaxies. Further, we find 10-15\% of the ICL's mass at large radii (\${\textgreater}150\$kpc) lies in a younger/bluer stellar population (\${\textbackslash}sim1\$Gyr), a phenomenon not seen in local samples. We attribute this light to the higher fraction of starforming/(post-)starburst galaxies in clusters at \$z{\textbackslash}sim0.5\$. Ultimately, we find the ICL's total mass to be \${\textbackslash}log M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm *\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm ICL\}/M\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash}sim11\$-12, constituting 5\%-20\% of the clusters' total stellar mass, or about a half of the value at \$z{\textbackslash}sim0\$. The above implies distinct formation histories for the ICL and BCGs/other massive cluster galaxies; i.e. the ICL at this epoch is still being constructed rapidly (\${\textbackslash}sim40M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$), while the BCGs have mostly completed their evolution. To be consistent with the ICL measurements of local massive clusters, such as the Virgo, our data suggest mass acquisition mainly from quiescent cluster galaxies is the principal source of ICL material in the subsequent \${\textbackslash}sim\$5 Gyr of cosmic time.},

We carry on this analysis down to a radial distance of {\textasciitilde}120 kpc from the brightest cluster galaxy. We found that the average metallicity of the ICL is [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde}-0.5, compatible with the value of the outskirts of the Milky Way. The mean stellar ages of the ICL are between 2 to 6 Gyr younger than the most massive galaxies of the clusters. Those results suggest that the ICL of these massive ({\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}15 Msol) clusters is formed by the stripping of MW-like objects that have been accreted at z{\textless}1, in agreement with current simulations. We do not find any significant increase in the fraction of light of the ICL with cosmic time, although the redshift range explored is narrow to derive any strong conclusion. When exploring the slope of the stellar mass density profile, we found that the ICL of the HFF clusters follows the shape of their underlying dark matter haloes, in agreement with the idea that the ICL is the result of the stripping of galaxies at recent times.},

For a Cold Dark Matter spectrum, the inclusion of the leading-order Lagrangian correction terms results in a value of the rms ensemble average {\textless}L{\textasciicircum}2{\textgreater}{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\} which is only a factor of 1.3 higher than the corresponding linear estimate, irrespective of the scale.

We find that \$j\$ of the stars, \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm stars\}\$, and baryons, \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bar\}\$, are strongly correlated with stellar and baryon mass, respectively, with the scatter being highly correlated with morphological proxies such as gas fraction, stellar concentration, (u-r) intrinsic colour, stellar age and the ratio of circular velocity to velocity dispersion. We compare with available observations at \$z=0\$ and find excellent agreement. We find that \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bar\}\$ follows the theoretical expectation of an isothermal collapsing halo under conservation of specific angular momentum to within \${\textbackslash}approx 50\$\%, while the subsample of rotation-supported galaxies are equally well described by a simple model in which the disk angular momentum is just enough to maintain marginally stable disks. We extracted evolutionary tracks of the stellar spin parameter of EAGLE galaxies and found that the fate of their \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm stars\}\$ at \$z=0\$ depends sensitively on their star formation and merger histories. From these tracks, we identified two distinct physical channels behind low \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm stars\}\$ galaxies at \$z=0\$: (i) galaxy mergers, and (ii) early star formation quenching. The latter can produce galaxies with low \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm stars\}\$ and early-type morphologies even in the absence of mergers.},

The model is designed for detailed evolution of galactic discs. We evolve discs in a series of annuli with fixed specific angular momentum, which allows us to make predictions for the radial and angular-momentum structure of galaxies. Most physical processes, including all channels of star formation and associated feedback, are performed in these annuli. We present the surface density profiles of our model spiral galaxies, both as a function of radius and specific angular momentum, and find the discs naturally build a pseduobulge-like component. Our main results are focussed on predictions relating to the integrated mass--specific angular momentum relation of stellar discs. The model produces a distinct sequence between these properties in remarkable agreement with recent observational literature. We investigate the impact Toomre disc instabilities have on shaping this sequence and find they are crucial for regulating both the mass and spin of discs. Without instabilities, high-mass discs would be systematically deficient in specific angular momentum by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2.5, with increased scatter. Instabilities also appear to drive the direction in which the mass--spin sequence of spiral galaxy discs evolves. With them, we find galaxies of fixed mass have higher specific angular momentum at later epochs.},

	abstract = {The estimated stellar masses of galaxies are widely used to characterize how the galaxy population evolves over cosmic time. If stellar masses can be estimated in a robust manner, free from any bias, global diagnostics such as the stellar mass function can be used to constrain the physics of galaxy formation. We explore how galaxy stellar masses, estimated by fitting broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with stellar population models, can be biased as a result of commonly adopted assumptions for the star-formation and chemical enrichment histories, recycled fractions and dust attenuation curves of galaxies. We apply the observational technique of broad-band SED fitting to model galaxy SEDs calculated by the theoretical galaxy formation model GALFORM, isolating the effect of each of these assumptions. We find that, averaged over the entire galaxy population, the common assumption of exponentially declining star-formation histories does not adversely affect stellar mass estimation. We show that fixing the metallicity in SED fitting or using sparsely sampled metallicity grids can introduce mass dependent systematics into stellar mass estimates. We find that the common assumption of a star-dust geometry corresponding to a uniform foreground dust screen can cause the stellar masses of dusty model galaxies to be significantly underestimated. Finally, we show that stellar mass functions recovered by applying SED fitting to model galaxies at high redshift can differ significantly in both shape and normalization from the intrinsic mass functions predicted by a given model. Given these differences, our methodology of using stellar masses estimated from model galaxy SEDs offers a new, self-consistent way to compare model predictions with observations.},

The long-term goal of the project is to better understand the origin of metal-poor stars and the formation of dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way halo by cross-validating these theoretical approaches. We combine GAMMA with the merger tree of the most massive galaxy found in the hydrodynamic simulation and compare the star formation rate, the metallicity distribution function (MDF), and the age–metallicity relationship predicted by the two approaches. We found that the SAM can reproduce the global trends of the hydrodynamic simulation. However, there are degeneracies between the model parameters, and more constraints (e.g., star formation efficiency, gas flows) need to be extracted from the simulation to isolate the correct semi-analytic solution. Stochastic processes such as bursty star formation histories and star formation triggered by supernova explosions cannot be reproduced by the current version of GAMMA. Non-uniform mixing in the galaxy’s interstellar medium, coming primarily from self-enrichment by local supernovae, causes a broadening in the MDF that can be emulated in the SAM by convolving its predicted MDF with a Gaussian function having a standard deviation of ∼0.2 dex. We found that the most massive galaxy in the simulation retains nearby 100\% of its baryonic mass within its virial radius, which is in agreement with what is needed in GAMMA to reproduce the global trends of the simulation.},

	abstract = {We use a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation calculated with Enzo and the semi-analytic galaxy formation model (SAM) GAMMA to address the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies in the early universe. The long-term goal of the project is to better understand the origin of metal-poor stars and the formation of dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way halo by cross-validating these theoretical approaches. We combine GAMMA with the merger tree of the most massive galaxy found in the hydrodynamic simulation and compare the star formation rate, the metallicity distribution function (MDF), and the age–metallicity relationship predicted by the two approaches. We found that the SAM can reproduce the global trends of the hydrodynamic simulation. However, there are degeneracies between the model parameters, and more constraints (e.g., star formation efﬁciency, gas ﬂows) need to be extracted from the simulation to isolate the correct semi-analytic solution. Stochastic processes such as bursty star formation histories and star formation triggered by supernova explosions cannot be reproduced by the current version of GAMMA. Non-uniform mixing in the galaxy’s interstellar medium, coming primarily from self-enrichment by local supernovae, causes a broadening in the MDF that can be emulated in the SAM by convolving its predicted MDF with a Gaussian function having a standard deviation of ∼0.2dex. We found that the most massive galaxy in the simulation retains nearby 100\% of its baryonic mass within its virial radius, which is in agreement with what is needed in GAMMA to reproduce the global trends of the simulation.},

	abstract = {We present results for a galaxy formation model that includes a simple treatment for the disruption of dwarf galaxies by gravitational forces and galaxy encounters within galaxy clusters. This is implemented a posteriori in a semi-analytic model by considering the stability of cluster dark matter sub-haloes at z=0. We assume that a galaxy whose dark matter substructure has been disrupted will itself disperse, while its stars become part of the population of intracluster stars responsible for the observed intracluster light. Despite the simplicity of this assumption, our results show a substantial improvement over previous models and indicate that the inclusion of galaxy disruption is indeed a necessary ingredient of galaxy formation models. We find that galaxy disruption suppresses the number density of dwarf galaxies by about a factor of two. This makes the slope of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function shallower, in agreement with observations. In particular, the abundance of faint, red galaxies is strongly suppressed. As a result, the luminosity function of red galaxies and the distinction between the red and the blue galaxy populations in colour-magnitude relationships are correctly predicted. Finally, we estimate a fraction of intracluster light comparable to that found in clusters of galaxies.},

	abstract = {We extend the phenomenological study of the evolving galaxy population of Peng et al. (2010) to the central/satellite dichotomy in Yang et al. Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) groups. We ﬁnd that satellite galaxies are responsible for all the environmental effects in our earlier work. The fraction of centrals that are red does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses, whereas that of the satellites depends on both. We deﬁne a relative satellite quenching efﬁciency εsat, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched upon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent of stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity, δ, ranging between 0.2 and at least 0.8. The red fraction of satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity δ, a measure of location within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e., dark matter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local density and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the dark matter halo mass, gives clues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show that the action of mass quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of the dark matter mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng et al. approach to predict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into passive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed mass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this phenomenological approach. We highlight the fact that the observed M∗ is exactly the same for the star-forming centrals and satellites and the observed M∗ for the star-forming satellites is independent of halo mass above 1012 M , which emphasizes the universality of the mass-quenching process that we identiﬁed in Peng et al. Post-quenching merging modiﬁes the mass function of the central galaxies but can increase the mass of typical centrals by only about 25\%.},

	abstract = {We use the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation SAG to study the relevance of mass and environmental quenching on satellite galaxies. We find that environmental processes dominate the star formation (SF) quenching of low-mass satellites (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$), whereas high-mass galaxies typically quench as centrals. High-mass galaxies that remain actively forming stars while being accreted are found to be mainly affected by mass quenching after their first infall. For a given stellar mass, our model predicts SF quenching to be less efficient in low-mass haloes both before and after infall, in contradiction with common interpretations of observational data. Our model supports a two-stage scenario to explain the SF quenching. Initially, the SF of satellites resembles that of centrals until the gas cooling rate is reduced to approximately half its value at infall. Then, the SF fades through secular processes that exhaust the cold gas reservoir. This reservoir is not replenished efficiently due to the action of either ram-pressure stripping (RPS) of the hot gas in low-mass satellites, or feedback from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in high-mass satellites. The delay times for the onset of SF quenching are found to range from \${\textbackslash}approx 3{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\}\$ to \${\textbackslash}approx 1{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\}\$ for low-mass (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) and high-mass (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) satellites, respectively. SF fades in \${\textbackslash}approx 1.5{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\}\$, largely independent of stellar mass. We find that the SF quenching of low-mass satellites supports the so-called delay-then-rapid quenching scenario. However, the SF history of \$z=0\$ passive satellites of any stellar mass is better described by a delay-then-fade quenching scenario.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new physical recipe into the De Lucia and Blaizot version of the Munich semi-analytic model built upon the Millennium dark matter simulation: the tidal stripping of stellar material from satellite galaxies during mergers. To test the significance of the new physical process we apply a Monte Carlo Markov Chain parameter estimation technique constraining the model with the \$K\$-band luminosity function, \$B-V\$ colours and the black hole-bulge mass relation. The differences in parameter correlations, and in the allowed regions in likelihood space, reveal the impact of the new physics on the basic ingredients of the model, such as the star-formation laws, feedback recipes and the black hole growth model. With satellite disruption in place, we get a model likelihood four times higher than in the original model, indicating that the new process seems to be favoured by observations. This is achieved mainly due to a reduction in black hole growth that produces a better agreement between the properties of central black holes and host galaxies. Compared to the best-fit model without disruption, the new model removes the excess of dwarf galaxies in the original recipe with a more modest supernova heating. The new model is now consistent with the three observational data sets used to constrain it, while significantly improving the agreement with observations for the distribution of metals in stars. Moreover, the model now follows the build up of intra-cluster light.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic "dark ages" to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z{\textasciitilde}1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than {\textasciitilde}1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

The goal of the CAMELS project is to provide theory predictions for different observables as a function of cosmology and astrophysics, and it is the largest suite of cosmological (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations designed to train machine learning algorithms. CAMELS contains thousands of different cosmological and astrophysical models by way of varying \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$, \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$, and four parameters controlling stellar and AGN feedback, following the evolution of more than 100 billion particles and fluid elements over a combined volume of \$(400{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}){\textasciicircum}3\$. We describe the simulations in detail and characterize the large range of conditions represented in terms of the matter power spectrum, cosmic star formation rate density, galaxy stellar mass function, halo baryon fractions, and several galaxy scaling relations. We show that the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites produce roughly similar distributions of galaxy properties over the full parameter space but significantly different halo baryon fractions and baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum. This emphasizes the need for marginalizing over baryonic effects to extract the maximum amount of information from cosmological surveys. We illustrate the unique potential of CAMELS using several machine learning applications, including non-linear interpolation, parameter estimation, symbolic regression, data generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.},

	abstract = {We investigate the physics driving the cosmic star formation (SF) history using the more than fifty large, cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations that together comprise the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations (OWLS) project. We systematically vary the parameters of the model to determine which physical processes are dominant and which aspects of the model are robust. Generically, we find that SF is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high redshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases as it is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas exhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. The higher redshift SF is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and to a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. The location and height of the peak in the SF history, and the steepness of the decline towards the present, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black hole feedback. Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling both boost the SF rate at late times. Galaxies form stars in a self-regulated fashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedback from massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling and accretion. Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to the assumed SF law. This can be understood in terms of self-regulation: if the SF efficiency is changed, then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to achieve the same rate of production of massive stars. Self-regulated feedback from accreting black holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed SF rate below redshift two, although more extreme feedback from SF, for example in the form of a top-heavy IMF at high gas pressures, can help.},

We start from published models, and investigate which observables are sensitive to a change in the star formation law, without altering any other model parameters. We show that changing the star formation law (i) does not significantly affect either the star formation history of the universe or the galaxy luminosity functions in the optical and near-IR, due to an effective balance between the quiescent and burst star formation modes; (ii) greatly affects the cold gas contents of galaxies; (iii) changes the location of galaxies in the SFR versus stellar mass plane, so that a second sequence of "passive" galaxies arises, in addition to the known "active" sequence. We show that this plane can be used to discriminate between the star formation laws.},

	abstract = {Galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) remain among the most challenging yet informative quantities to reproduce in simulations due to the large and complex mixture of physical processes that shape the radiation output of a galaxy. With the increasing number of surveys utilising broadband colours as part of their target selection criteria, the production of realistic SEDs in simulations is necessary for assisting in survey design and interpretation of observations. The recent success in reproducing the observed luminosity functions (LF) from far-UV to far-IR, using the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model {\textbackslash}shark{\textbackslash} and the SED generator {\textbackslash}prospect, represents a critical step towards better galaxy colour predictions. We show that with {\textbackslash}shark{\textbackslash} and {\textbackslash}prospect{\textbackslash} we can closely reproduce the optical colour distributions observed in the panchromatic GAMA survey. The treatment of feedback, star formation, central-satellite interactions and radiation re-processing by dust are critical for this achievement. The first three processes create a bimodal distribution, while dust attenuation defines the location and shape of the blue and red populations. While a naive comparison between observation and simulations displays the known issue of over-quenching of satellite galaxies, the introduction of empirically-motivated observational errors and classification from the same group finder used in GAMA greatly reduces this tension. The introduction of random re-assignment of \${\textbackslash}sim 15{\textbackslash}\%\$ of centrals/satellites as satellites/centrals on the simulation classification closely resembles the outcome of the group finder, providing a computationally less intensive method to compare simulations with observations.},

Decades of observations have yielded a variety of empirical rules about how it operates, but at present we have no comprehensive, quantitative theory. In this review I discuss the current state of the field of star formation, focusing on three central questions: what controls the rate at which gas in a galaxy converts to stars? What determines how those stars are clustered, and what fraction of the stellar population ends up in gravitationally-bound structures? What determines the stellar initial mass function, and does it vary with star-forming environment? I use these three question as a lens to introduce the basics of star formation, beginning with a review of the observational phenomenology and the basic physical processes. I then review the status of current theories that attempt to solve each of the three problems, pointing out links between them and opportunities for theoretical and numerical work that crosses the scale between them. I conclude with a discussion of prospects for theoretical progress in the coming years.},

The hot interiors of supernova explosions combine into larger bubbles that sweep-up the initially hydrostatic ISM into a dense, warm cloudy medium, enveloped by a much hotter and tenuous medium, all phases in near pressure equilibrium. The unbound hot phase develops into an outﬂow with wind speed increasing with distance as it accelerates from the disc. We follow the launch region of the galactic wind, where hot gas entrains and ablates warm ISM clouds leading to signiﬁcantly increased mass loading of the ﬂow, although we do not follow this material as it interacts with the galactic halo.},

Previous FIRE simulations used an identical source code (FIRE-1) for consistency. Motivated by the development of more accurate numerics - including hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, and supernova coupling algorithms - and exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce FIRE-2, an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the GIZMO code. We run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details of the star-formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects, provided that we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties of winds and circum-galactic media (CGM). Central ({\textasciitilde}kpc) mass concentrations in massive (L*) galaxies are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot halos). Multiple feedback mechanisms play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation; radiative feedback suppresses accretion onto dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in disks.

Due to the collision of two clusters, the dissipationless stellar component and the fluid-like X-ray emitting plasma are spatially segregated. By using both wide-field ground based images and HST/ACS images of the cluster cores, we create gravitational lensing maps which show that the gravitational potential does not trace the plasma distribution, the dominant baryonic mass component, but rather approximately traces the distribution of galaxies. An 8-sigma significance spatial offset of the center of the total mass from the center of the baryonic mass peaks cannot be explained with an alteration of the gravitational force law, and thus proves that the majority of the matter in the system is unseen.},

	abstract = {We use a high-resolution cosmological dark matter-only simulation to study the orbital trajectories of haloes and subhaloes in the environs of isolated hosts. We carefully tally all apsis points and use them to distinguish haloes that are infalling for the first time from those that occupy more evolved orbits. We find that roughly 21 per cent of subhaloes within a host's virial radius are currently on first infall, and have not yet reached their first orbital pericentre; roughly 44 per cent are still approaching their first apocentre after infall. For the range of host masses studied, roughly half of all accreted systems were pre-processed prior to infall, and about 20 per cent were accreted in groups. We confirm that the entire population of accreted subhaloes -- often referred to as "associated" subhaloes -- extend far beyond the virial radii of their hosts, with roughly half currently residing at distances that exceed \${\textbackslash}approx 1.2{\textbackslash}times r\_\{200\}\$. Many of these backsplash haloes have gained orbital energy since infall, and occupy extreme orbits that carry them well past their initial turnaround radii. Such extreme orbits are created during the initial accretion and dissolution of loosely bound groups, but also through penetrating encounters between subhaloes on subsequent orbits. The same processes may also give rise to unexpectedly abrupt losses of orbital energy. These effects combine, giving rise to a large variation in the ratio of sequent apocentres for accreted systems. We find that, within 2 virial radii from host centres, the concentrations of first-infall halos are remarkably similar those of isolated field halos, whereas backsplash haloes, as well as systems that were pre-processed, are considerably more concentrated.},

Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution.

	abstract = {Galactic halo gas traces inflowing star formation fuel and feedback from a galaxy's disk and is therefore crucial to our understanding of galaxy evolution. In this review, we summarize the multi-wavelength observational properties and origin models of Galactic and low redshift spiral galaxy halo gas. Galactic halos contain multiphase gas flows that are dominated in mass by the ionized component and extend to large radii. The densest, coldest halo gas observed in neutral hydrogen (HI) is generally closest to the disk ({\textless} 20 kpc), and absorption line results indicate warm and warm-hot diffuse halo gas is present throughout a galaxy's halo. The hot halo gas detected is not a significant fraction of a galaxy's baryons. The disk-halo interface is where the multiphase flows are integrated into the star forming disk, and there is evidence for both feedback and fueling at this interface from the temperature and kinematic gradient of the gas and HI structures. The origin and fate of halo gas is considered in the context of cosmological and idealized local simulations. Accretion along cosmic filaments occurs in both a hot ({\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}5.5 K) and cold mode in simulations, with the compressed material close to the disk the coldest and densest, in agreement with observations. There is evidence in halo gas observations for radiative and mechanical feedback mechanisms, including escaping photons from the disk, supernova-driven winds, and a galactic fountain. Satellite accretion also leaves behind abundant halo gas. This satellite gas interacts with the existing halo medium, and much of this gas will become part of the diffuse halo before it can reach the disk. The accretion rate from cold and warm halo gas is generally below a galaxy disk's star formation rate, but gas at the disk-halo interface and stellar feedback may be important additional fuel sources.},

I further address how these changes reveal galaxy formation processes that galaxy structural analyses can provide. This review is pedagogical and begins with a detailed discussion of the major methods in which galaxies are studied morphologically and structurally. This includes the well-established visual method; Sersic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; non-parametric structural methods including the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) method, as well as newer structural indices. Included is a discussion of how these structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies such as their scale, star formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive observational results are shown demonstrating how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to z{\textasciitilde}3, from small, compact and peculiar systems in the distant universe to the formation of the Hubble sequence we find today. This review further addresses how structural methods measure accurately the merger history out to z{\textasciitilde}3. The properties and evolution of bulges, disks, bars, and at z{\textgreater}1 large star forming clumps are also described, along with how morphological galaxy quenching occurs. Furthermore, the role of environment in producing structure in galaxies over cosmic time is treated. Alongside the evolution of general structure, I also delineate how galaxy sizes change with time, with measured sizes up to a factor of 2-5 smaller at high redshift at a given stellar mass. This review concludes with a discussion of how galaxy structure reveals the formation mechanisms behind galaxies, providing a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation.},

The MFs are determined using the HI and H\$\_2\$ conditional distributions and the galaxy stellar mass function, GSMF. For the conditional distributions we use the compilation presented in Calette et al. 2018. For determining the GSMF from \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}{\textbackslash}sim3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$ to \$3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, we combine two spectroscopic samples from the SDSS at the redshift range \$0.0033{\textless}z{\textless}0.2\$. We find that the low-mass end slope of the GSMF, after correcting from surface brightness incompleteness, is \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}approx-1.4\$, consistent with previous determinations. The obtained HI MFs agree with radio blind surveys. Similarly, the H\$\_2\$ MFs are consistent with CO follow-up optically-selected samples. We estimate the impact of systematics due to mass-to-light ratios and find that our MFs are robust against systematic errors. We deconvolve our MFs from random errors to obtain the intrinsic MFs. Using the MFs, we calculate cosmic density parameters of all the baryonic components. Baryons locked inside galaxies represent 5.4\% of the universal baryon content, while \${\textbackslash}sim96\$\% of the HI and H\$\_2\$ mass inside galaxies reside in late-type morphologies. Our results imply cosmic depletion times of H\$\_2\$ and total neutral H in late-type galaxies of \${\textbackslash}sim 1.3\$ and 7.2 Gyr, respectively, which shows that late type galaxies are on average inefficient in converting H\$\_2\$ into stars and in transforming HI gas into H\$\_2\$. Our results provide a fully self-consistent empirical description of galaxy demographics in terms of the bivariate gas--stellar mass distribution and their projections, the MFs. This description is ideal to compare and/or to constrain galaxy formation models.},

We find broad agreement with observed cluster UDGs and predict that they are not separate from the overall cluster dwarf population. UDGs in cluster environments form primarily from dwarf galaxies that experienced early cluster in-fall and subsequent quenching due to ram pressure. The ensuing dimming of these dwarf galaxies due to passive stellar evolution results in a population of very low surface brightness galaxies that are otherwise typical dwarfs. UDGs and non-UDGs alike are affected by tidal interactions with the cluster potential. Tidal stripping of dark matter, as well as mass loss from stellar evolution, results in the adiabatic expansion of stars, particularly in the lowest mass dwarfs. High mass dwarf galaxies show signatures of tidal heating while low mass dwarfs that survive until \$z=0\$ typically have not experienced such impulsive interactions. There is little difference between UDGs and non-UDGs in terms of their dark matter halos, stellar morphology, colors, and location within the cluster. In most respects cluster UDG and non-UDGs alike are similar to isolated dwarf galaxies, except for the fact that they are typically quenched.},

	abstract = {We investigate the dependence of the local galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) on galaxy morphology. We use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 with morphological classifications from Galaxy Zoo, and compare with the EAGLE cosmological simulation. At fixed halo mass in the mass range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.7\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{12.9\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, the median stellar masses of SDSS disc galaxies are up to a factor of 1.4 higher than the median masses of their elliptical counterparts. However, when we switch from the stellar masses from Kauffmann et al. to those calculated by Chang et al. or Brinchmann et al., the median SHMR from discs and ellipticals coincide in this mass range. For halo masses larger than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, discs are less massive than ellipticals in same-mass haloes, regardless of whose stellar mass estimates we use. However, we find that for these high halo masses the results for discs may be affected by central/satellite misclassifications. The EAGLE simulation predicts that discs are up to a factor of 1.5 more massive than elliptical galaxies residing in same-mass haloes less massive than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, in agreement with the Kauffmann et al. data. Haloes with masses between \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, that host disc galaxies, were assembled earlier than those hosting ellipticals. This suggests that the discs are more massive because they had more time for gas accretion and star formation. In \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{12.5\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ haloes, the central black holes in elliptical galaxies grew faster and became more massive than their counterparts in disc galaxies. This suggests that in this halo mass range the ellipticals are less massive because AGN feedback ejected more of the halo's gas reservoir, reducing star formation, and suppressing the (re)growth of stellar discs.},

	abstract = {Formation of galaxy clusters corresponds to the collapse of the largest gravitationally bound overdensities in the initial density field and is accompanied by the most energetic phenomena since the Big Bang and by the complex interplay between gravity-induced dynamics of collapse and baryonic processes associated with galaxy formation. Galaxy clusters are, thus, at the cross-roads of cosmology and astrophysics and are unique laboratories for testing models of gravitational structure formation, galaxy evolution, thermodynamics of the intergalactic medium, and plasma physics. At the same time, their large masses make them a useful probe of growth of structure over cosmological time, thus providing cosmological constraints that are complementary to other probes. In this review, we describe our current understanding of cluster formation: from the general picture of collapse from initial density fluctuations in an expanding Universe to detailed simulations of cluster formation including the effects of galaxy formation. We outline both the areas in which highly accurate predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter halos hosting clusters, their mass function, and clustering properties. Their study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar fractions and the thermodynamical and nonthermal processes in the intracluster plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the observed thermal properties of the intracluster plasma exhibit the most regular behavior and, thus, can be used to define robust observational proxies for the total cluster mass. Finally, we discuss the formation of clusters in nonstandard cosmological models, such as non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified gravity, along with prospects for testing these alternative scenarios with large cluster surveys in the near future.},

We are able to successfully isolate roughly 50\% of the different satellites contributing to the `Solar Neighbourhood' by applying the Mean-Shift clustering algorithm in energy-angular momentum space. Furthermore, a Fourier analysis of the space of orbital frequencies allows us to obtain accurate estimates of time since accretion for approximately 30\% of the recovered satellites.},

We show that the combined luminosity function of surviving and destroyed dwarfs at infall is similar in the various Auriga haloes, and is dominated by the destroyed dwarfs. There is, however, a strong dependence on infall time: destroyed dwarfs have typically early infall times, \$t\_\{infall\}{\textless}6\$ Gyr, whereas the majority of dwarfs accreted at \$t\_\{infall\}{\textgreater}10\$ Gyr have survived to the present day. Because of their late infall the surviving satellites today had higher metallicites at infall than their destroyed counterparts of similar infall mass; the difference is even more pronounced for the present-day metallicites of satellites, many of which continue to form stars after infall. In agreement with previous work, we find that a small number of relatively massive destroyed dwarf galaxies dominate the mass of the stellar haloes. However, there is a significant radial dependence: while 90 per cent of the mass in the inner regions (\${\textless}{\textbackslash},20{\textbackslash},\$kpc) is contributed, on average, by only 3 massive progenitors, the outer regions (\${\textgreater}{\textbackslash},100{\textbackslash},\$kpc) typically have \${\textbackslash}sim8\$ main progenitors of relatively lower mass. Finally, we show that a few massive progenitors dominate the metallicity distribution of accreted stars, even at the metal poor end. Contrary to common assumptions in the literature, dwarf galaxies of mass \$M\_\{*\}{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}7 {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ make up less than 10 per cent of the accreted, metal poor stars ([Fe/H] \${\textless}{\textbackslash},-3\$) in the inner \$50{\textbackslash},\$kpc.},

By varying both physical and numerical parameters, we investigate under what conditions the subhaloes undergo disruption. We confirm the conclusions from our more analytical assessment in van den Bosch et al. that most disruption is numerical in origin; as long as a subhalo is resolved with sufficient mass and force resolution, a bound remnant survives. This implies that state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from significant overmerging. We demonstrate that this is mainly due to inadequate force-softening, which causes excessive mass loss and artificial tidal disruption. In addition, we show that subhaloes in N-body simulations are susceptible to a runaway instability triggered by the amplification of discreteness noise in the presence of a tidal field. These two processes conspire to put serious limitations on the reliability of dark matter substructure in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We present two criteria that can be used to assess whether individual subhaloes in cosmological simulations are reliable or not, and advocate that subhaloes that satisfy either of these two criteria be discarded from further analysis. We discuss the potential implications of this work for several areas in astrophysics.},

The simulations predict that {\textasciitilde}50 per cent of satellites survive to redshift z = 0, with higher survival fractions in massive clusters than in groups and only small differences between baryonic and pure N-body simulations. For clusters, up to 90 per cent of galaxy disruption occurs in lower-mass sub-groups (i.e., during pre-processing); 96 per cent of satellites in massive clusters that were accreted at z {\textless} 2 and have not been pre-processed survive. Of those satellites that are disrupted, only a few per cent merge with other satellites, even in low-mass groups. The survival fraction changes rapidly from less than 10 per cent of those accreted at high z to more than 90 per cent at low z. This shift, which reflects faster disruption of satellites accreted at higher z, happens at lower z for more massive galaxies and those accreted onto less massive haloes. The disruption of satellite galaxies is found to correlate only weakly with their pre-accretion baryon content, star formation rate, and size, so that surviving galaxies are nearly unbiased in these properties. These results suggest that satellite disruption in massive haloes is uncommon, and that it is predominantly the result of gravitational rather than baryonic processes.},

	abstract = {The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) is currently in the process of transforming our view of star-forming galaxies in the distant (\$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim1\$) universe. Before ALMA, most of what we knew about dust-obscured star formation in distant galaxies was limited to the brightest submillimetre sources -- the so-called submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) -- and even the information on those sources was sparse, with resolved (i.e., sub-galactic) observations of the obscured star formation and gas reservoirs typically restricted to the most extreme and/or strongly lensed sources. Starting with the beginning of early science operations in 2011, the last nine years of ALMA observations have ushered in a new era for studies of high-redshift star formation. With its long baselines, ALMA has allowed observations of distant dust-obscured star formation with angular resolutions comparable to -- or even far surpassing -- the best current optical telescopes. With its bandwidth and frequency coverage, it has provided an unprecedented look at the associated molecular and atomic gas in these distant galaxies through targeted follow-up and serendipitous detections/blind line scans. Finally, with its leap in sensitivity compared to previous (sub-)millimetre arrays, it has enabled the detection of these powerful dust/gas tracers much further down the luminosity function through both statistical studies of color/mass-selected galaxy populations and dedicated deep fields. We review the main advances ALMA has helped bring about in our understanding of the dust and gas properties of high-redshift (\$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim1\$) star-forming galaxies during these first nine years of its science operations, and we highlight the interesting questions that may be answered by ALMA in the years to come.},

We ﬁnd the following: (1) the ENLR size of 12.1±0.2 kpc implies a smooth continuation of the size–luminosity relation out to large radii or a much larger break radius as previously proposed. (2) The kinematically disturbed ionized gas with line splits reaching 1000 km s−1 out to 6.1±1.5 kpc is aligned along the jet axis. (3) The extreme line broadening on kiloparsec scales is caused by the spatial and spectral blending of many distinct gas clouds separated on subarcsecond scales by different line-of-sight (LOS) velocities. The ENLR velocity ﬁeld combined with the known jet orientation rules out a simple scenario of a radiatively driven radial expansion of the outﬂow. Instead, we propose that a pressurized expanding hot gas cocoon created by the radio jet is impacting on an inclined gas disk, leading to transverse and/or backﬂow motion with respect to our LOS.The molecular gas morphology may be explained by either a density wave at the front of the outﬂow expanding along the jet direction as predicted by the positive feedback scenario or the cold gas may be trapped in a stellar overdensity caused by a recent merger event. Using 3C273 as a template for observations of high-redshifthyperluminous quasars reveals that large-scale ENLRs and kiloparsec-scale outﬂows may often be missed, due to the brightness of the nuclei and the limited sensitivity of current near-IR instrumentation.},

	abstract = {A key obstacle to developing a satisfying theory of galaxy evolution is the difficulty in extending analytic descriptions of early structure formation into full nonlinearity, the regime in which galaxy growth occurs. Extant techniques, though powerful, are based on approximate numerical methods whose Monte Carlo-like nature hinders intuition building. Here, we develop a new solution to this problem and its empirical validation. We first derive closed-form analytic expectations for the evolution of fixed percentiles in the real-space cosmic density distribution, \{{\textbackslash}it averaged over representative volumes observers can track cross-sectionally{\textbackslash}\}. Using the Lagrangian forms of the fluid equations, we show that percentiles in \${\textbackslash}delta\$---the density relative to the median---should grow as \${\textbackslash}delta(t){\textbackslash}propto{\textbackslash}delta\_\{0\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}{\textbackslash},t{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}beta\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}equiv2\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}equiv2\$ for Newtonian gravity at epochs after the overdensities transitioned to nonlinear growth. We then use 9.5 sq. deg. of Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS Redshift Survey data to map \{{\textbackslash}it galaxy{\textbackslash}\} environmental densities over \$0.2{\textless}z{\textless}1.5\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim\$7 Gyr) and infer \${\textbackslash}alpha=1.98{\textbackslash}pm0.04\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta=2.01{\textbackslash}pm0.11\$---consistent with our analytic prediction. These findings---enabled by swapping the Eulerian domain of most work on density growth for a Lagrangian approach to real-space volumetric averages---provide some of the strongest evidence that a lognormal distribution of early density fluctuations indeed decoupled from cosmic expansion to grow through gravitational accretion. They also comprise the first exact, analytic description of the nonlinear growth of structure extensible to (arbitrarily) low redshift. We hope these results open the door to new modeling of, and insight-building into, the galaxy growth and its diversity in cosmological contexts.},

We construct the merger trees of present day friends-of-friends groups and calculate a variety of statistics that quantify the masses of their progenitors as a function of redshift; accretion rates; and the redshift distribution of their most recent major merger. We also look in the forward direction and quantify the present day mass distribution of halos into which high redshift progenitors of a specific mass become incorporated. We find that EPS formalism and its Monte-Carlo extension capture the qualitative behaviour of all these statistics but, as redshift increases they systematically underestimate the masses of the most massive progenitors. This shortcoming is worst for the Monte-Carlo algorithm. We present a fitting function to a scaled version of the progenitor mass distribution and show how it can be used to make more accurate predictions of both progenitor and final halo mass distributions.},

We do so by tracking the evolutionary history of extended and normal-size galaxies selected at z=2 with log(M\_star) = 10.2 - 11 and stellar-half-mass-radii above and within 1-sigma of the stellar size--stellar mass relation, respectively. We match the stellar mass and star formation rate distributions of the two populations. By z=1, only 36\% of the extended massive galaxies have quenched, in contrast to a quenched fraction of 69\% for the normal-size massive galaxies. We find that normal-size massive galaxies build up their central stellar mass without a significant increase in their stellar size between z=2-4, whereas the stellar size of the extended massive galaxies almost doubles in the same time. In IllustrisTNG, lower black hole masses and weaker kinetic-mode feedback appears to be responsible for the delayed quenching of star formation in the extended massive galaxies. We show that relatively gas-poor mergers may be responsible for the lower central stellar density and weaker supermassive black hole feedback in the extended massive galaxies.},

The cosmological simulation was carried out with the GADGET-3 TreePM+SPH code using the MUlti Phase Particle Integrator (MUPPI) model. We disentangle the complex overlapping of stellar generations that rises from the top-down and inside-out formation of the galactic disc. We investigate cosmological signatures in the phase-space of mono-age populations and highlight features stemming from past and recent dynamical perturbations. In the simulation, we identify a satellite with a stellar mass of \$1.2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}9\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, i.e. stellar mass ratio \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}sim 5.5\$ per cent at the time, accreted at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 1.6\$, which resembles the major merger Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus that produced the Galactic thick disc, i.e. \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}sim 6\$ per cent. We found at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 0.5-0.4\$ two merging satellites with a stellar mass of \$8.8 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$5.1 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ that are associated to a strong starburst in the Star Formation History, which appears fairly similar to that recently found in the Solar Neighbourhood. Our findings highlight that detailed studies of coeval stellar populations kinematics, which are made available by current and future Gaia data releases and in synergy with simulations, are fundamental to unravel the formation and evolution of the Milky Way discs.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, observations of the cool interstellar medium in distant galaxies via molecular and atomic fine structure line emission has gone from a curious look into a few extreme, rare objects, to a mainstream tool to study galaxy formation, out to the highest redshifts. Molecular gas has now been observed in close to 200 galaxies at z{\textgreater}1, including numerous AGN host-galaxies out to z{\textasciitilde}7, highly starforming sub-millimeter galaxies (median redshift z{\textasciitilde}2.5), and increasing samples of 'main-sequence' star forming galaxies at z{\textasciitilde}1.5-2.5. Studies have moved well beyond simple detections, to dynamical imaging at kpc-scale resolution, and multi-line, multi-species studies that determine the physical conditions in the interstellar medium. Observations of the cool gas are the required complement to studies of the stellar density and star formation history of the Universe, as they reveal the phase of the interstellar medium that immediately precedes star formation. Current observations suggest that the order of magnitude increase in the cosmic star formation rate density from z{\textasciitilde}0 to 2 is commensurate with a similar increase in the gas to stellar mass ratio in star forming disk galaxies. Progress has been made on determining the CO luminosity to H\_2 mass conversion factor at high-z, and the dichotomy between high versus low depletion time values for main sequence versus starburst galaxies, respectively, with a likely dependence on metallicity and other local physical conditions. Studies of atomic fine structure line emission are rapidly progressing, with some tens of galaxies detected in the exceptionally bright [CII] 158 micron line to date. This line is proving to be a unique tracer of galaxy dynamics in the early Universe and has the potential to be the most direct means of obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for the first galaxies during cosmic reionization.},

Within this general framework, we develop an algorithm that accurately extracts the location of the ﬁrst apocenter of particles after infall into a halo, or splashback. We deﬁne the splashback radius of a halo as the smoothed average of the apocenter radii of individual particles. This deﬁnition allows us to reliably measure the splashback radii of 95\% of host halos above a resolution limit of 1000 particles. We show that, on average, the splashback radius and mass are converged to better than 5\% accuracy with respect to mass resolution, snapshot spacing, and all free parameters of the method.},

However, while useful in separating GCs into individual accretion events, the orbits of GC groups themselves have received less attention as probes of their progenitor galaxy properties. In this work, we use simulations of galaxies and their GC systems from the E-MOSAICS project to explore how the present-day orbital properties of GCs are related to the properties of their progenitor galaxies. We find that the orbits of GCs deposited by accretion events are sensitive to the mass and merger redshift of the satellite galaxy. Earlier mergers and larger galaxy masses deposit GCs at smaller median apocentres and lower total orbital energy. The orbital properties of accreted groups of GCs can therefore be used to infer the properties of their progenitor galaxy, though there exists a degeneracy between galaxy mass and accretion time. Combining GC orbits with other tracers (GC ages, metallicities) will help to break the galaxy mass/accretion time degeneracy, enabling stronger constraints on the properties of their progenitor galaxy. In situ GCs generally orbit at lower energies (small apocentres) than accreted GCs, however they exhibit a large tail to high energies and even retrograde orbits (relative to the present-day disc), showing significant overlap with accreted GCs. Applying the results to Milky Way GCs groups suggests a merger redshift \$z {\textbackslash}sim 1.5\$ for the Gaia Sausage/Enceladus and \$z{\textgreater}2\$ for the `low-energy'/Kraken group, adding further evidence that the Milky Way had two significant mergers in its past.},

For example, observations of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement with N-body simulations of the "Lambda Cold Dark Matter" (\{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}CDM) model: there are far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in cold dark matter halos (the "missing satellites" problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the most massive substructures (the "too-big-to-fail" problem); and the brightest satellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the "planes of satellites" problem). Here we present results from APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of twelve volumes selected to match the kinematics of the Local Group (LG) members. Applying the Eagle code to the LG environment, we find that our simulations match the observed abundance of LG galaxies, including the satellite galaxies of the MW and Andromeda. Due to changes to the structure of halos and the evolution in the LG environment, the simulations reproduce the observed relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individual dwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in their dark matter profiles. Satellite systems form with a range of spatial anisotropies, including one similar to that of the MW, confirming that such a configuration is not unexpected in \{{\textbackslash}Lambda\}CDM. Finally, based on the observed velocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide new estimates of the maximum circular velocity for the halos of nine MW dwarf spheroidals.},

In the dark matter, we typically identify two caustics: the outermost caustic located at {\textasciitilde}1.4r\_200m corresponding to the "splashback" radius, and a second caustic located at {\textasciitilde}0.6r\_200m which likely corresponds to the edge of the virialized material which has completed at least two pericentric passages. The splashback radius is ill defined in Local Group type environments where the halos of the two galaxies overlap. However, the second caustic is less affected by the presence of a companion, and is a more useful definition for the boundary of the Milky Way halo. Curiously, the stellar distribution also has a clearly defined caustic, which, in most cases, coincides with the second caustic of the dark matter. This can be identified in both radial density and radial velocity profiles, and should be measurable in future observational programmes. Finally, we show that the second caustic can also be identified in the phase-space distribution of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. Using the current dwarf galaxy population, we predict the edge of the Milky Way halo to be 292 +/- 61 kpc.},

	abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10{\textasciicircum}10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10{\textasciicircum}5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive set of convergence tests which explore the role of various numerical parameters on the equilibrium structure of a simulated dark matter halo. We report results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art, multi-stepping, parallel N-body codes: PKDGRAV and GADGET. We find that convergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of the gravitational softening, timestep, force accuracy, initial redshift, and particle number. For softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effects are negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii where the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the timestep is much shorter than the local orbital timescale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristic acceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enough particles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation timescale is longer than the age of the universe. The most stringent requirement for convergence is typically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxation criterion, which implies that in order to estimate accurate circular velocities at radii where the density contrast may reach \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}6\$, the region must enclose of order 3000 particles (or more than a few times \$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ within the virial radius). Applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM halo, we find that the spherically-averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slope shallower than -1.2 at the innermost resolved point, \$r {\textbackslash}sim 0.005 r\_\{200\}\$, with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the inner regions.},

	abstract = {We study the impact of numerical parameters on the properties of cold dark matter haloes formed in collisionless cosmological simulations. We quantify convergence in the median spherically-averaged circular velocity profiles for haloes of widely varying particle number, as well as in the statistics of their structural scaling relations and mass functions. In agreement with prior work focused on single haloes, our results suggest that cosmological simulations yield robust halo properties for a wide range of gravitational softening parameters, \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$, provided: 1) \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ is not larger than a "convergence radius", \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm conv\}\$, which is dictated by 2-body relaxation and determined by particle number, and 2) a sufficient number of timesteps are taken to accurately resolve particle orbits with short dynamical times. Provided these conditions are met, median circular velocity profiles converge to within \${\textbackslash}approx 10\$ per cent for radii beyond which the local 2-body relaxation timescale exceeds the Hubble time by a factor \${\textbackslash}kappa{\textbackslash}equiv t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm relax\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm H\}{\textbackslash}gt 0.177\$, with better convergence attained for higher \${\textbackslash}kappa\$. We provide analytic estimates of \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm conv\}\$ that build on previous attempts in two ways: first, by highlighting its explicit (but weak) softening-dependence and, second, by providing a simpler criterion in which \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm conv\}\$ is determined entirely by the mean inter-particle spacing, \$l\$; for example, better than \$10\$ per cent convergence in circular velocity for \$r{\textbackslash}gt 0.05{\textbackslash},l\$. We show how these analytic criteria can be used to assess convergence in structural scaling relations for dark matter haloes as a function of their mass or maximum circular speed.},

	abstract = {Previous studies of fueling black holes (BHs) in galactic nuclei have argued (on scales {\textasciitilde}0.01-1000pc) accretion is dynamical with inflow rates \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}{\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}eta{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}/t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm dyn\}\$ in terms of gas mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}\$, dynamical time \$t\_\{{\textbackslash}rm dyn\}\$, and some \${\textbackslash}eta\$. But these models generally neglected expulsion of gas by stellar feedback, or considered extremely high densities where expulsion is inefficient. Studies of star formation, however, have shown on sub-kpc scales the expulsion efficiency \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm wind\}=M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ejected\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm total\}\$ scales with the gravitational acceleration as \$(1-f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm wind\})/f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm wind\}{\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}bar\{a\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm grav\}/{\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}dot\{p\}/m\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}{\textbackslash}rangle{\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}/{\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}\$ where \${\textbackslash}bar\{a\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm grav\}{\textbackslash}equiv G{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm tot\}({\textless}r)/r{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}dot\{p\}/m\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}{\textbackslash}rangle\$ is the momentum injection rate from young stars. Adopting this as the simplest correction for stellar feedback, \${\textbackslash}eta {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}eta{\textbackslash},(1-f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm wind\})\$, we show this provides a more accurate description of simulations with stellar feedback at low densities. This has immediate consequences, predicting e.g. the slope and normalization of the \$M-{\textbackslash}sigma\$ and \$M-M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bulge\}\$ relation, \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm AGN\}-\$SFR relations, and explanations for outliers in compact Es. Most strikingly, because star formation simulations show expulsion is efficient (\$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm wind\}{\textbackslash}sim1\$) below total-mass surface density \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm tot\}/{\textbackslash}pi{\textbackslash},r{\textasciicircum}\{2\}{\textless}{\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}{\textbackslash}sim3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm kpc{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}\$ (where \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}={\textbackslash}langle{\textbackslash}dot\{p\}/m\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}{\textbackslash}rangle/({\textbackslash}pi{\textbackslash},G)\$), BH mass is predicted to specifically trace host galaxy properties above a critical surface brightness \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}\$ (B-band \${\textbackslash}mu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm B\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}{\textbackslash}sim 19{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm mag{\textbackslash},arcsec{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}\$). This naturally explains why BH masses preferentially reflect bulge properties or central surface-densities (\${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{1{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}\}\$), not 'total' galaxy properties.},

It describes how to download these snapshots and how to extract datasets from them, emphasising the meaning of variables, and their units. We provide examples for extracting the particle data in python. This data release complements our earlier release of numerous integrated properties of the galaxies in EAGLE through an SQL relational database. This database has been updated to include the additional simulations that are part of the present data release. Scientists wanting to use EAGLE may find it useful to first investigate whether their analysis can be performed using the database, before accessing the particle data. The particles in the snapshot files are indexed by a peano-hilbert key. This allows for an eased extraction of simply connected spatial volumes, without needing to read the entire snapshot. This makes it possible to analyse many aspects of galaxies using modest computing resources, even when using EAGLE simulations with large numbers of particles. A reading routine is provided to simplify this process.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed study of the molecular gas in the fast AGN-driven outflow in the nearby radio-loud Seyfert galaxy IC 5063. Using ALMA observations of a number of tracers (12CO(1-0), 12CO(2-1), 12CO(3-2), 13CO(2-1) and HCO+(4-3)), we map the differences in excitation, density and temperature of the gas. The results show that in the immediate vicinity of the radio jet, a fast outflow, with velocities up to 800 km/s, is occurring of which the gas has high excitation temperatures in the range 30-55 K, demonstrating the direct impact of the jet on the ISM. The relative brightness of the CO lines show that the outflow is optically thin. We estimate the mass of the molecular outflow to be 1.2 x 10{\textasciicircum}6 Msol and likely to be a factor 2-3 larger. This is similar to that of the outflow of atomic gas, but much larger than that of the ionised outflow, showing that the outflow is dominated by cold gas. The total mass outflow rate we estimate to be {\textasciitilde}12 Msol/yr. The mass of the outflow is much smaller than the total gas mass of the ISM of IC 5063. Therefore, although the influence of the radio jet is very significant in the inner regions, globally speaking the impact will be very modest. We use RADEX modelling to explore the physical conditions of the molecular gas in the outflow. Models with the outflowing gas being quite clumpy give the most consistent results and our preferred solutions have kinetic temperatures in the range 20-100 K and densities between 10{\textasciicircum}5 and 10{\textasciicircum}6 cm{\textasciicircum}-3. The resulting pressures are 10{\textasciicircum}6-10{\textasciicircum}7.5 K cm{\textasciicircum}-3, about two orders of magnitude higher than in the outer quiescent disk. The results strongly suggest that the outflow is driven by the radio jet expanding into a clumpy medium, creating a cocoon of gas which is pushed away from the jet axis resulting in a lateral outflow, very similar to what is predicted by numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {Predicting the merger timescale (\${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm merge\}\$) of merging dark matter halos, based on their orbital parameters and the structural properties of their hosts, is a fundamental problem in gravitational dynamics that has important consequences for our understanding of cosmological structure formation and galaxy formation. Previous models predicting \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm merge\}\$ have shown varying degrees of success when compared to the results of cosmological \$N\$-body simulations. We build on this previous work and propose a new model for \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm merge\}\$ that draws on insights derived from these simulations. We find that published predictions can provide reasonable estimates for \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm merge\}\$ based on orbital properties at infall, but tend to underpredict \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm merge\}\$ inside the host virial radius (\$R\_\{200\}\$) because tidal stripping is neglected, and overpredict it outside \$R\_\{200\}\$ because the host mass is underestimated. Furthermore, we find that models that account for orbital angular momentum via the circular radius \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm circ\}\$ underpredict (overpredict) \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm merge\}\$ for bound (unbound) systems. By fitting for the dependence of \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm merge\}\$ on various orbital and host halo properties,we derive an improved model for \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm merge\}\$ that can be applied to a merging halo at any point in its orbit. Finally, we discuss briefly the implications of our new model for \${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}rm merge\}\$ for semi-analytical galaxy formation modelling.},

	abstract = {We study the properties of the diffuse light in galaxy clusters forming in a large hydrodynamical cosmological simulation of the Lambda-CDM cosmology. The simulation includes a model for radiative cooling, star formation in dense cold gas, and feedback by SN-II explosions. We select clusters having mass M{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}(14) h{\textasciicircum}(-1) Msun and study the spatial distribution of their star particles. While most stellar light is concentrated in gravitationally bound galaxies orbiting in the cluster potential, we find evidence for a substantial diffuse component, which may account for the extended halos of light observed around central cD galaxies. We find that more massive simulated clusters have a larger fraction of stars in the diffuse light than the less massive ones. The intracluster light is more centrally concentrated than the galaxy light, and the stars in the diffuse component are on average older than the stars in cluster galaxies, supporting the view that the diffuse light is not a random sampling of the stellar population in the cluster galaxies. We thus expect that at least {\textasciitilde}10\% of the stars in a cluster may be distributed as intracluster light, largely hidden thus far due to its very low surface brightness.},

	abstract = {We study the origin of the diffuse stellar component (DSC) in 117 galaxy clusters extracted from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. We identify all galaxies present in the simulated clusters at 17 output redshifts, and then build the family trees for all the z=0 cluster galaxies. Then for each diffuse star particle identified at z=0, we look for the galaxy to which it once belonged at an earlier redshift, thus linking the presence of the diffuse stellar component to the galaxy formation history. The main results of our analysis are: (i) On average, half of the DSC star particles comes from galaxies associated with the family tree of the most massive galaxy (BCG), one quarter comes from the family trees of other massive galaxies, and the remaining quarter from dissolved galaxies. I.e., the formation of the DSC is parallel to the build-up of the BCG and other massive galaxies. (ii) Most DSC star particles become unbound during mergers in the formation history of the BGCs and of other massive galaxies, independent of cluster mass. Our results suggest that the tidal stripping mechanism is responsible only for a minor fraction of the DSC. (iii) At cluster radii larger than 250 kpc/h, the DSC fraction from the BCG is reduced and the largest contribution comes from the other massive galaxies; in the cluster outskirts, galaxies of all masses contribute to the DSC. (iv) The DSC does not have a preferred redshift of formation: however, most DSC stars are unbound at z{\textless}1. (v) The amount of DSC stars at z=0 does not corre late strongly with the global dynamical history of clusters, and increases weakly with cluster mass. [abridged]},

	abstract = {N-body simulations make unambiguous predictions for the abundance of substructures within dark matter halos. However, the inclusion of baryons in the simulations changes the picture because processes associated with the presence of a large galaxy in the halo can destroy subhalos and substantially alter the mass function and velocity distribution of subhalos. We compare the effect of galaxy formation on subhalo populations in two state-of-the-art sets of hydrodynamical CDM simulations of Milky Way mass halos, APOSTLE and AURIGA. We introduce a new method for tracking the orbits of subhalos between simulation snapshots that gives accurate results down to a few kiloparsecs from the centre of the halo. Relative to a dark matter-only simulation, the abundance of subhalos in APOSTLE is reduced by 50\% near the centre and by 10\% within r200. In AURIGA the corresponding numbers are 80\% and 40\%. The velocity distributions of subhalos are also affected by the presence of the galaxy, much more so in AURIGA than in APOSTLE . The differences on subhalo properties in the two simulations can be traced back to the mass of the central galaxies, which in AURIGA are typically twice as massive as those in APOSTLE . We show that some of the results from previous studies are inaccurate due to systematic errors in the modelling of subhalo orbits near the centre of halos.},

These simulations include a self-consistent treatment of all the major physical processes involved in galaxy formation. The simulated galaxies presented here each have a total mass of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12 M\_sun, but span a range of merger histories. These simulations allow us to study the competing importance of in-situ star formation (stars formed in the primary galaxy) and accretion of stars from subhalos in the building of stellar halos in a LambdaCDM universe. All four simulated galaxies are surrounded by a stellar halo, whose inner regions (r {\textless} 20 kpc) contain both accreted stars, and an in-situ stellar population. The outer regions of the galaxies' halos were assembled through pure accretion and disruption of satellites. Most of the in-situ halo stars formed at high redshift out of smoothly accreted cold gas in the inner 1 kpc of the galaxies' potential wells, possibly as part of their primordial disks. These stars were displaced from their central locations into the halos through a succession of major mergers. We find that the two galaxies with recently quiescent merger histories have a higher fraction of in-situ stars ({\textasciitilde}20-50\%) in their inner halos than the two galaxies with many recent mergers ({\textasciitilde}5-10\% in-situ fraction). Observational studies concentrating on stellar populations in the inner halo of the Milky Way will be the most affected by the presence of in-situ stars with halo kinematics, as we find that their existence in the inner few tens of kpc is a generic feature of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {We use the Galaxies-Intergalactic Medium Interaction Calculation (GIMIC) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the global structure and kinematics of stellar spheroids of Milky Way mass disc galaxies. Font et al. have recently demonstrated that these simulations are able to successfully reproduce the satellite luminosity functions and the metallicity and surface brightness profiles of the spheroids of the Milky Way and M31. A key to the success of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid from stars that formed in situ. While the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars, stars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at r {\textless} {\textasciitilde}30 kpc. In the present study we show that this component was primarily formed in a proto-disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc by dynamical heating associated with mass accretion. As a consequence of its origin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics (namely net prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than that of the spheroid component built from the disruption of satellites. In addition, the in situ component has a flattened distribution, that is due in part to its rotation. We make comparisons with measurements of the shape and kinematics of local galaxies, including the Milky Way and M31, and stacked observations of more distant galaxies. We find that the simulated disc galaxies have spheroids of the correct shape (oblate with a median axis ratio of {\textasciitilde}0.6 at radii of {\textless} {\textasciitilde}30 kpc, but note there is significant system-to-system scatter in this quantity) and that the kinematics show evidence for two components (due to in situ vs. accreted), as observed. Our findings therefore add considerable weight to the importance of dissipative processes in the formation of stellar haloes and to the notion of a 'dual stellar halo'.},

By comparing the position in [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] space of high \$e\$ stars with those of accreted galaxies from the EAGLE suite of cosmological simulations we constrain the mass of the accreted satellite to be in the range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{8.5\}{\textbackslash}lesssim M\_*{\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$.

	abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the dynamical properties of a simulated disk galaxy assembled hierarchically in the Lambda CDM cosmogony. At z=0, two distinct dynamical components are identified on the basis of the orbital parameters of stars in the galaxy: a slowly rotating, centrally concentrated spheroid and a disk-like component largely supported by rotation. These components are also recognized in the surface brightness profile of the galaxy, which can be very well approximated by the superposition of an R{\textasciicircum}\{1/4\} spheroid and an exponential disk. However, neither does the dynamically-identified spheroid follow de Vaucouleurs' law nor is the disk purely exponential, a resultwhich calls for caution when estimating the importance of the disk from traditional photometric decomposition techniques. The disk may be further decomposed into a thin, dynamically cold component with stars on nearly circularorbits and a hotter, thicker component with orbital parameters transitional between the thin disk and the spheroid. The spheroid is old, and has essentiallyno stars younger than the time elapsed since the last major accretion event {\textasciitilde}8 Gyr ago. The majority of thin disk stars, form after the merging activity is over, although a significant fraction {\textasciitilde}15\% of thin-disk stars are old enough to predate the last major merger event. This unexpected population of old disk stars consists mainly of the tidal debris of satellites whose orbital plane was coincident with the disk and whose orbits were circularized by dynamical friction prior to full disruption. Our results highlight the role of satellite accretion events in shaping the disk and the spheroidal component and reveal some of the clues to the assembly process of a galaxy preserved in the detailed dynamics of old stellar populations.},

	abstract = {The standard picture of galaxy formation motivates the decomposition of the Milky Way into 3--4 stellar populations with distinct kinematic and elemental abundance distributions: the thin disk, thick disk, bulge, and stellar halo. To test this idea, we construct a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for both simulated and observed stars in the Solar neighborhood, using measured velocities and iron abundances (i.e., an augmented Toomre diagram) as the distributions to be decomposed. We compare results for the Gaia-APOGEE DR16 crossmatch catalog of the Solar neighborhood with those from a suite of synthetic Gaia-APOGEE crossmatches constructed from FIRE-2 cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find that in both the synthetic and real data, the best-fit GMM uses five independent components, some of whose properties resemble the standard populations predicted by galaxy formation theory. Two components can be identified unambiguously as the thin disk and another as the halo. However, instead of a single counterpart to the thick disk, there are three intermediate components with different age and alpha abundance distributions (although these data are not used to construct the model). We use decompositions of the synthetic data to show that the classified components indeed correspond to stars with different origins. By analogy with the simulated data, we show that our mixture model of the real Gaia-APOGEE crossmatch distinguishes the following components: (1) a classic thin disk of young stars on circular orbits (46\%), (2) thin disk stars heated by interactions with satellites (22\%), (3, 4) two components representing the velocity asymmetry of the alpha-enhanced thick disk (27\%), and (5) a stellar halo consistent with early, massive accretion (4\%).},

	abstract = {Matter distribution around clusters is highly anisotropic from their being the nodes of the cosmic web. Clusters' shape and the number of filaments they are connected to, i.e., their connectivity, should reflect their level of anisotropic matter distribution and must be, in principle, related to their physical properties. We investigate the influence of the dynamical state and the formation history on both the morphology and local connectivity of about 2400 groups and clusters of galaxies from the large hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG at z=0. We find that the mass of groups and clusters mainly influences the geometry of the matter distribution: massive halos are significantly more elliptical, and more connected to the cosmic web than low-mass ones. Beyond the mass-driven effect, ellipticity and connectivity are correlated and are imprints of the growth rate of groups and clusters. Both anisotropy measures appear to trace different dynamical states, such that unrelaxed groups and clusters are more elliptical and more connected than relaxed ones. This relation between matter anisotropies and dynamical state is the sign of different accretion histories. Relaxed groups and clusters are mostly formed long time ago, and slowly accreting matter at the present time. They are rather spherical and weakly connected to their environment, mostly because they had enough time to relax and, hence, lost the connection with their preferential directions of accretion and merging. In contrast, late-formed unrelaxed objects are highly anisotropic with large connectivities and ellipticities. These groups and clusters are in formation phase and must be strongly affected by the infalling of materials from filaments.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in constraining the massive accretions ({\textgreater}1:10) experienced by the Milky Way (MW) and the Andromeda galaxy (M31) offers an opportunity to understand the dwarf galaxy population of the Local Group. Using zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of MW-mass haloes and concentrating on subhaloes that are thought to be capable of hosting dwarf galaxies, we demonstrate that the infall of a massive progenitor is accompanied with the accretion and destruction of a large number of subhaloes. Massive accreted progenitors do not increase the total number of infalling subhaloes onto a MW-mass host, but instead focus surrounding subhaloes onto the host causing a clustering in the infall time of subhaloes. This leads to a temporary elevation in the number of subhaloes as well as changes in their cumulative radial profile within the virial radius of the host. Surviving associated subhaloes with a massive progenitor have a large diversity in their orbits. We find that the star formation quenching times of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{5\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\} {\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{*\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{7\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$) are clustered around the times of the most massive accretions suffered by the MW and M31. Our results imply that a) the quenching time of dwarf spheroidals is a good proxy of their infall time and b) the absence of recently quenched satellites around M31 suggests that M33 is not on its first infall and was accreted much earlier.},

Via Machinae is based on ANODE, a general method that uses conditional density estimation and sideband interpolation to detect local overdensities in the data in a model agnostic way. By applying ANODE to the positions, proper motions, and photometry of stars observed by Gaia, Via Machinae obtains a collection of those stars deemed most likely to belong to a stellar stream. We further apply an automated line-finding method based on the Hough transform to search for line-like features in patches of the sky. In this paper, we describe the Via Machinae algorithm in detail and demonstrate our approach on the prominent stream GD-1. A companion paper contains our identification of other known stellar streams as well as new stellar stream candidates from Via Machinae. Though some parts of the algorithm are tuned to increase sensitivity to cold streams, the Via Machinae technique itself does not rely on astrophysical assumptions, such as the potential of the Milky Way or stellar isochrones. This flexibility suggests that it may have further applications in identifying other anomalous structures within the Gaia dataset, for example debris flow and globular clusters.},

We confirm that result from an analysis of APOGEE-DR14 element abundances and \${\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\}\$-DR2 kinematics of halo stars. We show that \${\textbackslash}sim\$2/3 of nearby halo stars have high orbital eccentricities (\$e {\textbackslash}gtrsim 0.8\$), and abundance patterns typical of massive Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites today, characterised by relatively low [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe]. The trend followed by high \$e\$ stars in the [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane shows a change of slope at [Fe/H]\${\textbackslash}sim-1.3\$, which is also typical of stellar populations from relatively massive dwarf galaxies. Low \$e\$ stars exhibit no such change of slope within the observed [Fe/H] range and show slightly higher abundances of Mg, Al and Ni. Unlike their low \$e\$ counterparts, high \$e\$ stars show slightly retrograde motion, make higher vertical excursions and reach larger apocentre radii. By comparing the position in [Mg/Fe]-[Fe/H] space of high \$e\$ stars with those of accreted galaxies from the EAGLE suite of cosmological simulations we constrain the mass of the accreted satellite to be in the range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{8.5\}{\textbackslash}lesssim M\_*{\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We show that the median orbital eccentricities of debris are largely unchanged since merger time, implying that this accretion event likely happened at \$z{\textbackslash}lesssim1.5\$. The exact nature of the low \$e\$ population is unclear, but we hypothesise that it is a combination of \${\textbackslash}textit\{in situ\}\$ star formation, high \${\textbar}z{\textbar}\$ disc stars, lower mass accretion events, and contamination by the low \$e\$ tail of the high \$e\$ population. Finally, our results imply that the accretion history of the Milky Way was quite unusual.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the dynamical properties of a simulated disk galaxy assembled hierarchically in the Lambda CDM cosmogony. At z=0, two distinct dynamical components are identified on the basis of the orbital parameters of stars in the galaxy: a slowly rotating, centrally concentrated spheroid and a disk-like component largely supported by rotation. These components are also recognized in the surface brightness profile of the galaxy, which can be very well approximated by the superposition of an R{\textasciicircum}\{1/4\} spheroid and an exponential disk. However, neither does the dynamically-identified spheroid follow de Vaucouleurs' law nor is the disk purely exponential, a resultwhich calls for caution when estimating the importance of the disk from traditional photometric decomposition techniques. The disk may be further decomposed into a thin, dynamically cold component with stars on nearly circularorbits and a hotter, thicker component with orbital parameters transitional between the thin disk and the spheroid. The spheroid is old, and has essentiallyno stars younger than the time elapsed since the last major accretion event {\textasciitilde}8 Gyr ago. The majority of thin disk stars, form after the merging activity is over, although a significant fraction {\textasciitilde}15\% of thin-disk stars are old enough to predate the last major merger event. This unexpected population of old disk stars consists mainly of the tidal debris of satellites whose orbital plane was coincident with the disk and whose orbits were circularized by dynamical friction prior to full disruption. Our results highlight the role of satellite accretion events in shaping the disk and the spheroidal component and reveal some of the clues to the assembly process of a galaxy preserved in the detailed dynamics of old stellar populations.},

	abstract = {(Abridged) We describe a new iterative approach for the realization of equilibrium N-body systems for given density distributions. Our method uses elements of Schwarzschild's technique and of the made-to-measure method, but is based on a different principle. Starting with some initial assignment of particle velocities, we calculate their orbits using a flexible tree-based force algorithm in the stationary potential of the target density distribution. The difference of the time-averaged density response produced by these orbits with respect to the initial density configuration is characterized through a merit function, and a stationary solution of the collisionless Boltzmann equation is found by minimizing this merit function directly by iteratively adjusting the initial velocities. Because the distribution function is in general not unique for a given density structure, we augment the merit function with additional constraints that single out a desired target solution. We do this for broad classes of axisymmetric density distributions by numerically solving the Jeans equations to obtain the second velocity moments, which are then imposed as further constraints in the optimization process. The velocity adjustment is carried out with a stochastic process in which new velocities are randomly drawn from an approximate solution of the distribution function, but are kept only when they improve the fit. Our method converges rapidly and is flexible enough to allow the construction of solutions with third integrals of motion, including disk galaxies with realistic velocity distributions. We demonstrate that the new method reproduces analytic distribution functions where they are known (such as the Hernquist sphere), and that it yields very stable N-body realizations for a variety of examples of compound galaxy models, considerably improving on widely used moment-based approaches.},

Based on the fact that the stellar populations of the constituent components of galaxies differ by their dynamical properties, we develop two simple models for galaxy decomposition using the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. The first model uses a single dynamical parameter and can distinguish 4 components: thin disc, thick disc, counter-rotating disc and bulge. The second model uses one more dynamical parameter, was defined in a probabilistic manner, and distinguishes two components: bulge and disc. The number fraction of disc-dominated galaxies at a given stellar mass obtained by our models agrees well with observations for masses exceeding \$ {\textbackslash}log\_\{10\}(M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot)=10\$. S{\textbackslash}'ersic indices and half-mass radii for the bulge components agree well with those for real galaxies. The mode of the distribution of S{\textbackslash}'ersic indices for the disc components is at the expected value of \$n=1\$. However, disc half-mass radii are smaller than those for real galaxies, in accordance with previous findings that the IllustrisTNG simulation produces undersized discs.},

	abstract = {We present a new method for constraining the Milky Way halo gravitational potential by simultaneously fitting multiple tidal streams. This method requires full three-dimensional positions and velocities for all stars to be fit, but does not require identification of any specific stream or determination of stream membership for any star. We exploit the principle that the action distribution of stream stars is most clustered when the potential used to calculate the actions is closest to the true potential. Clustering is quantified with the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), which also provides conditional uncertainties for our parameter estimates. We show, for toy Gaia-like data in a spherical isochrone potential, that maximizing the KLD of the action distribution relative to a smoother distribution recovers the true values of the potential parameters. The precision depends on the observational errors and the number of streams in the sample; using KIII giants as tracers, we measure the enclosed mass at the average radius of the sample stars accurate to 3\% and precise to 20-40\%. Recovery of the scale radius is precise to 25\%, and is biased 50\% high by the small galactocentric distance range of stars in our mock sample (1-25 kpc, or about three scale radii, with mean 6.5 kpc). About 15 streams, with at least 100 stars per stream, are needed to obtain upper and lower bounds on the enclosed mass and scale radius when observational errors are taken into account; 20-25 streams are required to stabilize the size of the confidence interval. If radial velocities are provided for stars out to 100 kpc (10 scale radii), all parameters can be determined with 10\% accuracy and 20\% precision (1.3\% accuracy in the case of the enclosed mass), underlining the need for ground-based spectroscopic follow-up to complete the radial velocity catalog for faint halo stars observed by Gaia.},

	abstract = {The standard picture of galaxy formation motivates the decomposition of the Milky Way into 3--4 stellar populations with distinct kinematic and elemental abundance distributions: the thin disk, thick disk, bulge, and stellar halo. To test this idea, we construct a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for both simulated and observed stars in the Solar neighborhood, using measured velocities and iron abundances (i.e., an augmented Toomre diagram) as the distributions to be decomposed. We compare results for the Gaia-APOGEE DR16 crossmatch catalog of the Solar neighborhood with those from a suite of synthetic Gaia-APOGEE crossmatches constructed from FIRE-2 cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find that in both the synthetic and real data, the best-fit GMM uses five independent components, some of whose properties resemble the standard populations predicted by galaxy formation theory. Two components can be identified unambiguously as the thin disk and another as the halo. However, instead of a single counterpart to the thick disk, there are three intermediate components with different age and alpha abundance distributions (although these data are not used to construct the model). We use decompositions of the synthetic data to show that the classified components indeed correspond to stars with different origins. By analogy with the simulated data, we show that our mixture model of the real Gaia-APOGEE crossmatch distinguishes the following components: (1) a classic thin disk of young stars on circular orbits (46\%), (2) thin disk stars heated by interactions with satellites (22\%), (3, 4) two components representing the velocity asymmetry of the alpha-enhanced thick disk (27\%), and (5) a stellar halo consistent with early, massive accretion (4\%).},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08185},
	abstract = {In the currently favored cosmological paradigm galaxies form hierarchically through the accretion of numerous satellite galaxies. Since the satellites are much less massive than the host halo, they occupy a small fraction of the volume in action space defined by the potential of the host halo. Since actions are conserved when the potential of the host halo changes adiabatically, stars from an accreted satellite are expected to remain clustered in action space as the host halo evolves. In this paper, we identify accreted satellites in three Milky Way like disk galaxies from the cosmological baryonic FIRE-2 simulations by tracking satellite galaxies through simulation snapshots. We then try to recover these satellites by applying the cluster analysis algorithm Enlink to the orbital actions of accreted star particles in the present-day snapshot. We define several metrics to quantify the success of the clustering algorithm and use these metrics to identify well-recovered and poorly-recovered satellites. We plot these satellites in the infall time-progenitor mass (or stellar mass) space, and determine the boundaries between the well-recovered and poorly-recovered satellites in these two spaces with classification tree method. The groups found by Enlink are more likely to correspond to a real satellite if they have high significance, a quantity assigned by Enlink. Since cosmological simulations predict that most stellar halos have a population of insitu stars, we test the ability of Enlink to recover satellites when the sample is contaminated by 10-50\% of insitu star particles, and show that most of the satellites well-recovered by Enlink in the absence of insitu stars, stay well-recovered even with 50\% contamination. We thus expect that, in the future, cluster analysis in action space will be useful in upcoming data sets (e.g. Gaia) for identifying accreted satellites in the Milky Way.},

We survey satellites around \$80{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the massive, \$M\_K{\textless}-22.4\$ mag, hosts in the Local Volume.

We separate the satellites into late- and early-type, finding the mass-size relations are very similar between them, to within \${\textbackslash}sim5{\textbackslash}\%\$. This similarity indicates that the quenching and transformation of a late-type dwarf into an early-type involves only very mild size evolution. Considering the distribution of apparent ellipticities, we infer the intrinsic shapes of the early- and late-type samples. Combining with literature samples, we find that both types of dwarfs get thicker at fainter luminosities but early-types are always rounder at fixed luminosity. Finally, we compare the LV satellites with dwarf samples from the cores of the Virgo and Fornax clusters. We find that the cluster satellites show similar scaling relations to the LV early-type dwarfs but are roughly \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ larger at fixed mass, which we interpret as being due to tidal heating in the cluster environments. The dwarf structure results presented here are a useful reference for simulations of dwarf galaxy formation and the transformation of dwarf irregulars into spheroidals.},

We show that the properties of the central star-forming galaxy, such as the radial stellar surface density profile and star formation history, are: i) robust to stochastic variations associated with the so-called "Butterfly Effect"; and ii) well converged over 3.5 orders of magnitude in mass resolution. We find that there are approximately five times as many satellite galaxies at this high resolution compared to a standard (\$m\_b{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{4-5\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) resolution simulation of the same system. This is primarily because 2/3rds of the high resolution satellites do not form at standard resolution. A smaller fraction (1/6th) of the satellites present at high resolution form and disrupt at standard resolution; these objects are preferentially low-mass satellites on intermediate- to low-eccentricity orbits with impact parameters \${\textbackslash}lesssim 30\$ kpc. As a result, the radial distribution of satellites becomes substantially more centrally concentrated at higher resolution, in better agreement with recent observations of satellites around Milky Way-mass haloes. Finally, we show that our galaxy formation model successfully forms ultra-faint galaxies and reproduces the stellar velocity dispersion, half-light radii, and \$V\$-band luminosities of observed Milky Way and Local Group dwarf galaxies across 7 orders of magnitude in luminosity (\$10{\textasciicircum}3\$-\$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ \${\textbackslash}rm L\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$).},

We also simulate fiducial data based on upcoming stage IV galaxy surveys and use them to reconstruct the Hubble rate \$H(z)\$ and the angular diameter distance \$d\_A(z)\$ in order to reconstruct our null test and forecast how well it can constrain deviations from the cosmological constant model. We find that our new test can easily rule out several realistic scenarios based on the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi void model at confidence of \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ at mid to high redshifts (\$z{\textgreater}0.5\$).},

While significant progress has been made with recent integral-field spectroscopic surveys of nearby galaxies, much can be learned from analyzing the large sets of realistic galaxies now available through state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We present an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, named auto-GMM, based on Gaussian mixture models, to isolate intrinsic structures in simulated galaxies based on their kinematic phase space. For each galaxy, the number of Gaussian components allowed by the data is determined through a modified Bayesian information criterion. We test our method by applying it to prototype galaxies selected from the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG. Our method can effectively decompose most galactic structures. The intrinsic structures of simulated galaxies can be inferred statistically by non-human supervised identification of galaxy structures. We successfully identify four kinds of intrinsic structures: cold disks, warm disks, bulges, and halos. Our method fails for barred galaxies because of the complex kinematics of particles moving on bar orbits.},

We exemplify this method using a simulated Milky Way analogue, whose stellar component hosts: thin and thick discs, classical and pseudo bulges, and a stellar halo. The properties of these stellar structures are in good agreement with observational expectations in terms of sizes, shapes and rotational support. Interestingly, the two kinematic discs show surface mass density profiles more centrally concentrated than exponentials, while the bulges and the stellar halo are purely exponential. We trace back in time the Lagrangian mass of each component separately to study their formation history. Between z{\textasciitilde}3 and the end of halo virialization, z{\textasciitilde}1.3, all components lose a fraction of their angular momentum. The classical bulge loses the most ({\textasciitilde}95\%) and the thin disc the least ({\textasciitilde}60\%).

	abstract = {Diffuse intracluster light (ICL) and cD galaxy halos are believed to originate from galaxy evolution and disruption. We present a kinematic study of the ICL in the Hydra I cluster core, using planetary nebulas (PNs) as tracers. We used multi-slit imaging spectroscopy with FORS2 on VLT-UT1 to detect 56 PNs associated with diffuse light in the central 100 x 100 kpc{\textasciicircum}2 of Hydra I. We measured their [OIII] magnitudes, sky positions, and velocity distribution (LOSVD), and compared with the phase-space distribution of nearby galaxies. The luminosity function of the detected PNs is consistent with that expected at a distance of {\textasciitilde}50 Mpc. Their number density is {\textasciitilde}4 times lower for the light seen than expected, and we discuss ram pressure stripping of the PNs by the hot ICM as one of the possible explanations. The LOSVD histogram of the PNs is highly non-Gaussian and multipeaked: it is dominated by a broad central component with sigma{\textasciitilde}500 km/s at around the average velocity of the cluster, and shows two additional narrower peaks at 1800 km/s and 5000 km/s. The main component is broadly consistent with the outward continuation of the intracluster halo of NGC 3311, which was earlier shown to have a velocity dispersion of {\textasciitilde}470 km/s at radii of {\textgreater}50". Galaxies with velocities in this range are absent in the central 100 x 100 kpc{\textasciicircum}2 and may have been disrupted earlier to build this component. The PNs in the second peak in the LOSVD at 5000 km/s are coincident spatially and in velocities with a group of dwarf galaxies in the MSIS field. They may trace the debris from the ongoing tidal disruption of these galaxies. Most of the diffuse light in the core of Hydra is still not phase-mixed. The build-up of ICL and the dynamically hot cD halo around NGC 3311 are ongoing, through the accretion of material from galaxies falling into the cluster core and tidally interacting with its potential well.},

	abstract = {Member galaxies within galaxy clusters nowadays can be routinely identiﬁed in cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations using methods based on identifying self bound, locally over dense substructures. However, distinguishing the central galaxy from the stellar diffuse component within clusters is notoriously difﬁcult, and in the centre it is not even clear if two distinct stellar populations exist. Here, after subtracting all member galaxies, we use the velocity distribution of the remaining stars and detect two dynamically, well-distinct stellar components within simulated galaxy clusters. These differences in the dynamics can be used to apply an unbinding procedure which leads to a spatial separation of the two components into a cD and a diffuse stellar component (DSC). Applying our new algorithm to a cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation we ﬁnd that – in line with previous studies – these two components have clearly distinguished spatial and velocity distributions as well as different star formation histories. We show that the DSC fraction – which can broadly be associated with the observed intracluster light – does not depend on the virial mass of the galaxy cluster and is much more sensitive to the formation history of the cluster. We conclude that the separation of the cD and the DSC in simulations, based on our dynamical criteria, is more physically motivated than current methods which depend on implicit assumptions on a length-scale associated with the cD galaxy and therefore represent a step forward in understanding the different stellar components within galaxy clusters. Our results also show the importance of analysing the dynamics of the DSC to characterize its properties and understand its origin.},

	abstract = {Providing initial conditions is an essential procedure for numerical simulations of galaxies. The initial conditions for idealised individual galaxies in \$N\$-body simulations should resemble observed galaxies and be dynamically stable for time scales much longer than their characteristic dynamical times. However, generating a galaxy model ab initio as a system in dynamical equilibrium is a difficult task, since a galaxy contains several components, including a bulge, disc, and halo. Moreover, it is desirable that the initial-condition generator be fast and easy to use. We have now developed an initial-condition generator for galactic \$N\$-body simulations that satisfies these requirements. The developed generator adopts a distribution-function-based method, and it supports various kinds of density models, including custom-tabulated inputs and the presence of more than one disc. We tested the dynamical stability of systems generated by our code, representing early- and late-type galaxies, with \$N=\${\textasciitilde}2,097,152 and 8,388,608 particles, respectively, and we found that the model galaxies maintain their initial distributions for at least 1{\textasciitilde}Gyr. The execution times required to generate the two models were \$8.5\$ and \$221.7\$ seconds, respectively, which is negligible compared to typical execution times for \$N\$-body simulations.

Recent analyses of galactic stellar data from the {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} satellite have uncovered an earlier massive accretion event, the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES), which merged with the MW around 10 Gyr ago. Here, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamics simulation to study properties of simulated MW-mass haloes constrained to have accretion histories similar to that of the MW, specifically the recent accretion of an "LMC" galaxy and a "GES'' merger, with a quiescent period between the GES merger and the infall of the LMC (the "GES {\textbackslash}\& LMC" class). We find that \${\textbackslash}sim 16\$ per cent of MW-mass haloes have an LMC; \${\textbackslash}sim 5\$ per cent have a GES event and no further merger with an equally massive object since \$z=1\$; and only \$0.65\$ per cent belong to the LMC {\textbackslash}\& GES category. The progenitors of the MWs in this last category are much less massive than average at early times but eventually catch up with the mean. The LMC {\textbackslash}\& GES class of galaxies naturally end up in the "blue cloud" in the colour-magnitude diagram at \$z=0\$, tend to have a disc morphology and have a larger than average number of satellite galaxies.},

For the first time we address the question of the tidal disruption of satellites in simulations by utilising simultaneously a) a realistic set of orbits extracted from cosmological simulations, b) a three component host galaxy with live halo, disc and bulge components, and c) satellites from hydrodynamical simulations. We analyse the statistical properties of the satellite debris of all massive galaxies reaching the inner Milky Way on a timescale of 2 Gyr. Up to 80\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the dark matter is stripped from the satellites, while this happens for up to 30\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of their stars. The stellar debris ends mostly in the inner Milky Way halo, whereas the dark matter debris shows a flat mass distribution over the full main halo. The dark matter debris follows a density profile with inner power law index \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{{\textbackslash}rm DM\}=-0.66\$ and outer index \${\textbackslash}beta\_\{{\textbackslash}rm DM\}=2.94\$, while for stars \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{*\}=-0.44\$ and \${\textbackslash}beta\_\{*\}=6.17\$. In the inner 25 kpc, the distribution of the stellar debris is flatter than that of the dark matter debris and the orientations of their short axes differ significantly. Changing the orientation of the stellar disc by 90\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm\{o\}\}\$ has only a minor impact on the distribution of the satellite debris. Our results indicate that the dark matter is more easily stripped than stars from the Milky Way satellites. The structure of the debris is dominated by the satellite orbital properties. The radial profiles, the flattening and the orientation of the stellar and dark matter debris are significantly different, which prevents the prediction of the dark matter distribution from the observed stellar component.},

We process the simulated halos through the Auriga2PAndAS pipeline and create PAndAS-like mocks that fold in all observational limitations of the survey data (foreground contamination from the Milky Way stars, incompleteness of the stellar catalogues, photometric uncertainties, etc). This allows us to study the survey data and the mocks in the same way and generate directly comparable density maps and radial density profiles. We show that the simulations are overall compatible with the observations. Nevertheless, some systematic differences exist, such as a preponderance for metal-rich stars in the mocks. While these differences could suggest that M31 had a different accretion history or has a different mass compared to the simulated systems, it is more likely a consequence of an under-quenching of the star formation history of galaxies, related to the resolution of the Auriga simulations. The direct comparison enabled by our approach offers avenues to improve our understanding of galaxy formation as they can help pinpoint the observable differences between observations and simulations. Ideally, this approach will be further developed through an application to other stellar halo simulations. To facilitate this step, we release the pipeline to generate the mocks, along with the six mocks presented and used in this contribution.},

Empirical models are employed to relate (peak) subhalo mass to dwarf stellar mass, and we use constraints from z=0 observations and hydrodynamical simulations to estimate the metallicity distribution of the accreted stellar material. The dominant contributors to the accreted stellar mass are relatively massive dwarfs with M\_star {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}8-10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_sun. Halos with more quiescent accretion histories tend to have lower mass progenitors (10{\textasciicircum}8-10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_sun), and lower overall accreted stellar masses. Ultra-faint mass (M\_star {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}5 M\_sun) dwarfs contribute a negligible amount ({\textless}{\textless} 1\%) to the accreted stellar mass and, despite having low average metallicities, supply a small fraction ({\textasciitilde}2-5 \%) of the very metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] {\textless} -2. Dwarfs with masses 10{\textasciicircum}5 {\textless} M\_star/M\_sun {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}8 provide a substantial amount of the very metal-poor stellar material ({\textasciitilde}40-80 \%), and even relatively metal-rich dwarfs with M\_star {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_sun can contribute a considerable fraction ({\textasciitilde}20-60 \%) of metal-poor stars if their metallicity distributions have significant metal-poor tails. Finally, we find that the generic assumption of a quiescent assembly history for the MW halo seems to be in tension with the mass spectrum of its surviving dwarfs. We suggest that the MW could be a "transient fossil"; a quiescent halo with a recent accretion event(s) that disguises the preceding formation history of the halo.},

Using slices in magnitude, colour and location on the sky, we decompose RGB stars belonging to the disc and halo by fitting 2-dimensional Gaussians to the Galactic proper motion distributions. The number counts of RGB stars are converted to total stellar halo luminosity using a suite of isochrones weighted by age and metallicity, and by applying a volume correction based on the stellar halo density profile. Our method is tested and calibrated using Galaxia and N-body models. We find a total luminosity (out to 100 kpc) of L\_halo = 7.9 +/- 2.0 x 10{\textasciicircum}8 L\_Sun excluding Sgr, and L\_halo = 9.4 +/- 2.4 x 10{\textasciicircum}8 L\_Sun including Sgr. These values are appropriate for our adopted stellar halo density profile and metallicity distribution, but additional systematics related to these assumptions are quantified and discussed. Assuming a stellar mass-to-light ratio appropriate for a Kroupa initial mass function (M*/L = 1.5), we estimate a stellar halo mass of M*\_halo = 1.4 +/- 0.4 x 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_Sun. This mass is larger than previous estimates in the literature, but is in good agreement with the emerging picture that the (inner) stellar halo is dominated by one massive dwarf progenitor. Finally, we argue that the combination of a {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_Sun mass and an average metallicity of {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} -1.5 for the Galactic halo points to an ancient ({\textasciitilde}10 Gyr) merger event.},

	abstract = {High-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations are currently limited to relatively small volumes due to their computational expense. However, much larger volumes are required to probe rare, overdense environments, and measure clustering statistics of the large scale structure. Typically, zoom simulations of individual regions are used to study rare environments, and semi-analytic models and halo occupation models applied to dark matter only (DMO) simulations are used to study the Universe in the large-volume regime. We propose a new approach, using a machine learning framework to explore the halo-galaxy relationship in the periodic EAGLE simulations, and zoom C-EAGLE simulations of galaxy clusters. We train a tree based machine learning method to predict the baryonic properties of galaxies based on their host dark matter halo properties. The trained model successfully reproduces a number of key distribution functions for an infinitesimal fraction of the computational cost of a full hydrodynamic simulation. By training on both periodic simulations as well as zooms of overdense environments, we learn the bias of galaxy evolution in differing environments. This allows us to apply the trained model to a larger DMO volume than would be possible if we only trained on a periodic simulation. We demonstrate this application using the \$(800 {\textbackslash}; {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}){\textasciicircum}3\$ P-Millennium simulation, and present predictions for key baryonic distribution functions and clustering statistics from the EAGLE model in this large volume.},

Recent observations of Milky Way-like galaxies have revealed a wide range in stellar halo mass, including cases with no statistically significant detection of a stellar halo, as in the case of M101, NGC3351 and NGC1042. We use the Illustris simulation to investigate the scatter in stellar halo content and, in particular, to study the formation of galaxies with the smallest fraction of this diffuse component. Stellar halos are far from spherical, which diminishes the surface brightness of the stellar halo for face-on disks. Once accounting for projection effects, we find that the stellar halo fraction f\_SH correlates strongly with galaxy morphology and star formation rate, but not with environment, in agreement with observations. Galaxies with the lowest stellar halo fractions are disk-dominated, star-forming and assemble their dark matter halos on average earlier than galaxies with similar stellar masses. Accreted satellites are also lower in stellar mass and have earlier infall times than centrals with high f\_SH. In situ rather than accreted stars dominate the stellar halos of galaxies with the lowest stellar halo fractions, with a transition radius from in situ to accretion-dominated r{\textasciitilde}45 kpc. Our results extrapolated to real galaxies such as M101 may indicate that these galaxies inhabit old halos which endured mergers only at higher redshifts and evolved relatively unperturbed in the last {\textasciitilde}10 Gyrs.},

We select a sample of {\textasciitilde}1200 ETGs in the TNG100 and TNG50 simulations, spanning a stellar mass range of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10.3\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and within the range of (g-r) colour and lambda-ellipticity diagram populated by observed ETGs. We determine photometric parameters, intrinsic shapes, and kinematic observables in their extended stellar halos. We study the variation in kinematics from center to halo and connect it to a change in the intrinsic shape of the galaxies. We find that the simulated galaxy sample reproduces the diversity of kinematic properties observed in ETG halos. Simulated fast rotators (FRs) divide almost evenly in one third having flat lambda profiles and high halo rotational support, a third with gently decreasing profiles, and another third with low halo rotation. Slow rotators (SRs) tend to have increased rotation in the outskirts, with half of them exceeding lambda=0.2. For \$M\_\{*\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ halo rotation is unimportant. A similar variety of properties is found for the stellar halo intrinsic shapes. Rotational support and shape are deeply related: the kinematic transition to lower rotational support is accompanied by a change towards rounder intrinsic shape. Triaxiality in the halos of FRs increases outwards and with stellar mass. Simulated SRs have relatively constant triaxiality profiles. Simulated stellar halos show a large variety of structural properties, with quantitative but no clear qualitative differences between FRs and SRs. At the same stellar mass, stellar halo properties show a gradual transition and significant overlap between the two families, despite the clear bimodality in the central regions. This is in agreement with observations of extended photometry and kinematics. [abridged]},

Here, we present detailed comparisons between the stellar halos of Milky Way-mass disk galaxies observed as part of the Dragonfly Nearby Galaxies Survey (DNGS) and stellar mass-matched galaxies in the TNG100 run of the IllustrisTNG project. We produce stellar mass maps as well as mock \$g\$ and \$r\$-band images for randomly oriented simulated galaxies, convolving the latter with the Dragonfly PSF and taking care to match the background noise, surface brightness limits and spatial resolution of DNGS. We measure azimuthally averaged stellar mass density and surface brightness profiles, and find that the DNGS galaxies generally have less stellar mass (or light) at large radii ({\textgreater}20 kpc) compared to their mass-matched TNG100 counterparts, and that simulated galaxies with similar surface density profiles tend to have low accreted mass fractions for their stellar mass. We explore potential solutions to this apparent "missing outskirts problem" by implementing several ad-hoc adjustments within TNG100 at the stellar particle level. Although we are unable to identify any single adjustment that fully reconciles the differences between the observed and simulated galaxy outskirts, we find that artificially delaying the disruption of satellite galaxies and reducing the spatial extent of in-situ stellar populations result in improved matches between the outer profile shapes and stellar halo masses, respectively. Further insight can be achieved with higher resolution simulations that are able to better resolve satellite accretion, and with larger samples of observed galaxies.},

The Auriga haloes are diverse in their masses and density profiles; mean metallicity and metallicity gradients; ages; and shapes, reflecting the stochasticity inherent in their accretion and merger histories. A comparison with observations of nearby late-type galaxies shows very good agreement between most observed and simulated halo properties. However, Auriga haloes are typically too massive. We find a connection between population gradients and mass assembly history: galaxies with few significant progenitors have more massive haloes, possess large negative halo metallicity gradients and steeper density profiles. The number of accreted galaxies, either disrupted or under disruption, that contribute 90\% of the accreted halo mass ranges from 1 to 14, with a median of 6.5, and their stellar masses span over three orders of magnitude. The observed halo mass--metallicity relation is well reproduced by Auriga and is set by the stellar mass and metallicity of the dominant satellite contributors. This relationship is found not only for the accreted component but also for the total (accreted + in-situ) stellar halo. Our results highlight the potential of observable halo properties to infer the assembly history of galaxies.},

Recent studies in integrated light, however, report a few galaxies, including the nearby disk galaxy M101, that have no measurable stellar halos to the detection limit. We aim to quantify the stellar content and structure of M101's outskirts by resolving its stars. We present the photometry of its stars based on deep F606W and F814W images taken with Hubble Space Telescope as part of the GHOSTS survey. The constructed CMDs of stars reach down to two magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch. We derived radial number density profiles of the bright red giant branch (RGB) stars. The mean color of the RGB stars at \$R {\textbackslash}sim\$ 40 -- 60 kpc is similar to those of metal-poor globular clusters in the Milky Way. We also derived radial surface brightness profiles using the public image data provided by the Dragonfly team. Both the radial number density and surface brightness profiles were converted to radial mass density profiles and combined. We find that the mass density profiles show a weak upturn at the very outer region, where surface brightness is as faint as \${\textbackslash}mu\_g{\textbackslash}approx 34\$ mag arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. An exponential disk + power-law halo model on the mass density profiles finds the total stellar halo mass of \$M\_\{halo\}=8.2\_\{-2.2\}{\textasciicircum}\{+3.5\}{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}7M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. The total stellar halo mass does not exceed \$M\_\{halo\} = 3.2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ when strongly truncated disk models are considered. Combining the halo mass with the total stellar mass of M101, we obtain the stellar halo mass fraction of \$M\_\{halo\}/M\_\{gal\} = 0.20\_\{-0.08\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.10\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ with an upper limit of 0.78{\textbackslash}\%.

Depending on the sequence and nature of these mergers that follow the first phase of the in-situ star formation, these accretion histories may lead to ETGs that have low or high mass halos, and that rotate fast or slow. Since the stellar halos maintain the fossil records of the events that led to their formation, a discontinuity may be in place between the inner regions of ETGs and their outer halos, because the time required for the halos stars to exchange their energies and momenta is very long compared with the age of these systems. Exquisite deep photometry and extended spectroscopy for significant samples of ETGs are then used to quantify the occurrence and significance of such a transition in the galaxies structural and kinematical parameters. Once this transition radius is measured, its dependency with the effective radius of the galaxies light distribution and total stellar masses can be investigated. Such correlations can then be compared with the predictions of accreted, i.e. ex-situ vs. in-situ components from cosmological simulations to validate such models.},

Here we present a comprehensive inventory of structure within 50 kpc from the Galactic center using a sample of 5684 giants at \${\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textgreater}40{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ and \${\textbar}Z{\textbar}{\textgreater}2\$ kpc. We identify known structures including the high-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ disk, the in-situ halo (disk stars heated to eccentric orbits), Sagittarius (Sgr), \$Gaia\$-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), the Helmi Streams, Sequoia, and Thamnos. Additionally, we identify the following new structures: (i) Aleph ([Fe/H]\$=-0.5\$), a low eccentricity structure that rises a surprising 10 kpc off the plane, (ii, iii) Arjuna ([Fe/H]\$=-1.2\$) and I'itoi ([Fe/H]\${\textless}-2\$), which comprise the high-energy retrograde halo along with Sequoia, and (iv) Wukong ([Fe/H]\$=-1.6\$), a prograde phase-space overdensity chemically distinct from GSE. For each structure we provide [Fe/H], [\${\textbackslash}alpha\$/Fe], and orbital parameters. Stars born within the Galaxy are a major component at \${\textbar}Z{\textbar}{\textbackslash}sim\$2 kpc (\${\textbackslash}approx\$60\${\textbackslash}\%\$), but their relative fraction declines sharply to \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$5\${\textbackslash}\%\$ past 15 kpc. Beyond 15 kpc, \${\textgreater}\$80\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the halo is built by two massive (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) accreted dwarfs: GSE ([Fe/H]\$=-1.2\$) within 25 kpc, and Sgr ([Fe/H]\$=-1.0\$) beyond 25 kpc. This explains the relatively high overall metallicity of the halo ([Fe/H]\${\textbackslash}approx-1.2\$). We attribute \${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$95\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the sample to one of the listed structures, pointing to a halo built entirely from accreted dwarfs and heating of the disk.},

	abstract = {We apply our recently proposed "quadratic genetic modification" approach to generating and testing the effects of alternative mass accretion histories for a single \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM halo. The goal of the technique is to construct different formation histories, varying the overall contribution of mergers to the fixed final mass. This enables targeted studies of galaxy and dark matter halo formation's sensitivity to the smoothness of mass accretion. Here, we focus on two dark matter haloes, each with four different mass accretion histories. We find that the concentration of both haloes systematically decreases as their merger history becomes smoother. This causal trend tracks the known correlation between formation time and concentration parameters in the overall halo population. At fixed formation time, we further establish that halo concentrations are sensitive to the order in which mergers happen. This ability to study an individual halo's response to variations in its history is highly complementary to traditional methods based on emergent correlations from an extended halo population.},

	abstract = {We present the evolution of the structure of relaxed cold dark matter haloes in the cosmology from the Planck satellite. Our simulations cover 5 decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. Due to the increased matter density and power spectrum normalization the concentration mass relation in the Planck cosmology has a 20 percent higher normalization at redshift z=0 compared to WMAP cosmology. We confirm that CDM haloes are better described by the Einasto profile; for example, at scales near galaxy half-light radii CDM haloes have significantly steeper density profiles than implied by NFW fits. There is a scatter of 0.2 dex in the Einasto shape parameter at fixed halo mass, adding further to the diversity of CDM halo profiles. The evolution of the concentration mass relation in our simulations is not reproduced by any of the analytic models in the literature. We thus provide a simple fitting formula that accurately describes the evolution between redshifts z=5 to z=0 for both NFW and Einasto fits. Finally, the observed concentrations and halo masses of spiral galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies at low redshifts are in good agreement with our simulations, suggesting only mild halo response to galaxy formation on these scales.},

More and more governments provide project-related funding rather than multipurpose funding that covers the total annual costs of a research performing entity (such as a university department). So, like it or not, researchers have to present their research ideas and convince funding bodies about the usefulness and importance of their intended research work.Writing the research proposal is not simply typing words and punctuation. It requires succinctly and clearly chronicling the facts, as well as crafting a convincing line of reasoning for funding the project. For the best result, both the logical, verbal left side of the brain and the intuitive, creative right side of the brain need to work as a team.This article covers the process of writing a proposal, from research idea to submission to the funding body. The key to good writing is linking the text into a logical project flow. Therefore, in the early stage of writing an RTD proposal, developing the chain of reasoning and creating a flow chart is recommended to get a clear overview of the entire project and to visualise how the many work packages are connected.},

Using this sample of clusters we set an empirical limit on the amount of scatter in ICL surface brightness profiles of such clusters at z=0.5 and constrain the progenitor population and formation mechanism of the ICL by measuring the ICL surface brightness profile, the ICL color and color gradient, and the total ICL luminosity within 10{\textless}r{\textless}110 kpc. The observed scatter is physical, which we associate with differences in ICL assembly process, formation epoch, and/or ICL content. Using stellar population synthesis models we transform the observed colors to metallicity. For three of the four clusters we find clear negative gradients that, on average, decrease from super solar in the central regions of the BCG to sub-solar in the ICL. Such negative color/metallicity gradients can arise from tidal stripping of L* galaxies and/or the disruption of dwarf galaxies, but not major mergers with the BCG. We also find that the ICL at 110 kpc has a color comparable to m*+2 red sequence galaxies and a total luminosity between 10{\textless}r{\textless}110 kpc of 4-8 L*. This suggests that the ICL is dominated by stars liberated from galaxies with L{\textgreater}0.2 L* and that neither dwarf disruption nor major mergers with the BCG alone can explain the observed level of luminosity and remain consistent with either the observed evolution in the faint end slope of the luminosity function or predictions for the number of BCG major mergers since z=1. Taken together, the results of this pilot study are suggestive of a formation history for these clusters in which the ICL is built-up by the stripping of {\textgreater}0.2 L* galaxies, and disfavor significant contribution to the ICL by dwarf disruption or major mergers with the BCG.},

We ﬁnd good agreement with integrated-light observations if we mimic observational methods to measure the mass of the stellar halo by selecting regions of an image via projected radius relative to the disk scale length or by their surface density in stellar mass . However, these observational methods systematically underestimate the accreted stellar component, deﬁned in our (and most) simulations as the mass of stars formed outside of the host galaxy, by up to a factor of ten, since the accreted component is centrally concentrated and therefore substantially obscured by the galactic disk. Furthermore, these observational methods introduce spurious dependencies of the estimated accreted stellar component on the stellar mass and size of galaxies that can obscure the trends in accreted stellar mass predicted by cosmological simulations, since we ﬁnd that in our simulations the size and shape of the central galaxy is not strongly correlated with the assembly history of the accreted stellar halo. This effect persists whether galaxies are viewed edge-on or face-on. We show that metallicity or color information may provide a way to more cleanly delineate in observations the regions dominated by accreted stars. Absent additional data, we caution that estimates of the mass of the accreted stellar component from single-band images alone should be taken as lower limits.},

Our goal is to explore how the properties of the halo depend on the selection criteria used for defining a sample of halo stars. Once this is understood we proceed to measure the shape and orientation of the halo's velocity ellipsoid and we use this information to put constraints on the gravitational potential of the Galaxy. We use the recently released Gaia DR1 catalogue cross-matched to the RAVE dataset for our analysis. We develop a dynamical criterion based on the distribution function of stars in various Galactic components, using action integrals to identify halo members, and compare this to metallicity and to kinematically selected samples. With this new method, we find 1156 stars in the Solar Neighbourhood to be likely members of the stellar halo. Our dynamically selected sample consists mainly of distant giants on elongated orbits. Their metallicity distribution is rather broad, with roughly half of the stars having [M/H] \${\textbackslash}ge -1\$ dex. The use of different selection criteria has an important impact on the characteristics of the velocity distributions obtained. Nonetheless, for our dynamically selected and for the metallicity selected samples, we find the local velocity ellipsoid to be aligned in spherical coordinates in a Galactocentric reference frame: this suggests that the total gravitational potential is rather spherical in the region spanned by the orbits of the halo stars in these samples.},

We find that the ICL fraction in the three bands is, on average, higher for the merging clusters, ranging between \${\textbackslash}sim7-23{\textbackslash}\%\$, compared with the \${\textbackslash}sim 2-11{\textbackslash}\%\$ found for the relaxed systems. We observe a nearly constant value (within the error bars) in the ICL fraction of the regular clusters at the three wavelengths considered, which would indicate that the colors of the ICL and the cluster galaxies are, on average, coincident and, thus, their stellar populations. However, we find a higher ICL fraction in the F606W filter for the merging clusters, consistent with an excess of lower-metallicity/younger stars in the ICL, which could have migrated violently from the outskirts of the infalling galaxies during the merger event.},

	abstract = {[Abridged] In this paper, we carry out a detailed analysis of the performance of two different methods to identify the diffuse stellar light in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. One method is based on a dynamical analysis of the stellar component. The second method is closer to techniques commonly employed in observational studies. Both the dynamical method and the method based on the surface brightness limit criterion are applied to the same set of hydrodynamical simulations for a large sample about 80 galaxy clusters. We find significant differences between the ICL and DSC fractions computed with the two corresponding methods, which amounts to about a factor of two for the AGN simulations, and a factor of four for the CSF set. We also find that the inclusion of AGN feedback boosts the DSC and ICL fractions by a factor of 1.5-2, respectively, while leaving the BCG+ICL and BCG+DSC mass fraction almost unchanged. The sum of the BCG and DSC mass stellar mass fraction is found to decrease from {\textasciitilde}80 per cent in galaxy groups to {\textasciitilde}60 per cent in rich clusters, thus in excess of what found from observational analysis. We identify the average surface brightness limits that yields the ICL fraction from the SBL method close to the DSC fraction from the dynamical method. These surface brightness limits turn out to be brighter in the CSF than in the AGN simulations. This is consistent with the finding that AGN feedback makes BCGs to be less massive and with shallower density profiles than in the CSF simulations. The BCG stellar component, as identified by both methods, are slightly older and more metal-rich than the stars in the diffuse component.},

The stars of the structures that assembled to form the Milky Way should now make up much or all of its bulge and halo, in which case one hopes to find "fossil" evidence for those precursor structures in the present distribution of halo stars. Confirmation that this process is continuing came with the discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which is being disrupted by the Milky Way, but direct evidence that this process provided the bulk of the Milky Way's population of old stars has so far been lacking. Here we show that about ten per cent of the metal--poor stars in the halo of the Milky Way, outside the radius of the Sun's orbit, come from a single coherent structure that was disrupted during or soon after the Galaxy's formation. This object had a highly inclined orbit about the Milky Way at a maximum distance of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 16 kpc, and it probably resembled the Fornax and Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxies.},

For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (G\_BP-G\_RP) colour are also available. The passbands for G, G\_BP, and G\_RP are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Gaia EDR3 represents a significant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 percent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30--40 percent for the parallaxes and by a factor {\textasciitilde}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, G\_BP, and G\_RP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1 percent level.},

	abstract = {The Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey is a survey of \${\textgreater}400\$ square degrees centered on the Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) galaxies that has provided the most extensive panorama of a \$L\_{\textbackslash}star\$ galaxy group to large projected galactocentric radii. Here, we collate and summarise the current status of our knowledge of the substructures in the stellar halo of M31, and discuss connections between these features. We estimate that the 13 most distinctive substructures were produced by at least 5 different accretion events, all in the last 3 or 4 Gyrs. We suggest that a few of the substructures furthest from M31 may be shells from a single accretion event. We calculate the luminosities of some prominent substructures for which previous estimates were not available, and we estimate the stellar mass budget of the outer halo of M31. We revisit the problem of quantifying the properties of a highly structured dataset; specifically, we use the OPTICS clustering algorithm to quantify the hierarchical structure of M31's stellar halo, and identify three new faint structures. M31's halo, in projection, appears to be dominated by two `mega-structures', that can be considered as the two most significant branches of a merger tree produced by breaking M31's stellar halo into smaller and smaller structures based on the stellar spatial clustering. We conclude that OPTICS is a powerful algorithm that could be used in any astronomical application involving the hierarchical clustering of points. The publication of this article coincides with the public release of all PAndAS data products.},

The spatially-resolved rotation velocity (V) and velocity dispersion (\${\textbackslash}sigma\$) of bulge and disk components have been simultaneously estimated using the penalized pixel fitting (pPXF) method with photometrically defined weights for the two components. We introduce a new subroutine of pPXF for dealing with degeneracy in the solutions. We show that the V and \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ distributions in each galaxy can be reconstructed using the kinematics and weights of the bulge and disk components. The combination of two distinct components provides a consistent description of the major kinematic features of galaxies over a wide range of morphological types. We present Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations showing that the galaxy stellar mass scales with both V and \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ for both components of all galaxy types. We find a tight Faber-Jackson relation even for the disk component. We show that the bulge and disk components are kinematically distinct: (1) the two components show scaling relations with similar slopes, but different intercepts; (2) the spin parameter \${\textbackslash}lambda\_R\$ indicates bulges are pressure-dominated systems and disks are supported by rotation; (3) the bulge and disk components have, respectively, low and high values in intrinsic ellipticity. Our findings suggest that the relative contributions of the two components explain, at least to first order, the complex kinematic behaviour of galaxies.},

	abstract = {To gain understanding of the complicated, non-linear and numerical processes associated with the tidal evolution of dark matter subhaloes in numerical simulation, we perform a large suite of idealized simulations that follow individual N-body subhaloes in a fixed, analytical host halo potential. By varying both physical and numerical parameters, we investigate under what conditions the subhaloes undergo disruption. We confirm the conclusions from our more analytical assessment in van den Bosch et al. that most disruption is numerical in origin; as long as a subhalo is resolved with sufficient mass and force resolution, a bound remnant survives. This implies that state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from significant overmerging. We demonstrate that this is mainly due to inadequate force-softening, which causes excessive mass loss and artificial tidal disruption. In addition, we show that subhaloes in N-body simulations are susceptible to a runaway instability triggered by the amplification of discreteness noise in the presence of a tidal field. These two processes conspire to put serious limitations on the reliability of dark matter substructure in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We present two criteria that can be used to assess whether individual subhaloes in cosmological simulations are reliable or not, and advocate that subhaloes that satisfy either of these two criteria be discarded from further analysis. We discuss the potential implications of this work for several areas in astrophysics.},

	abstract = {We use the age-metallicity distribution of 96 Galactic globular clusters (GCs) to infer the formation and assembly history of the Milky Way (MW), culminating in the reconstruction of its merger tree. Based on a quantitative comparison of the Galactic GC population to the 25 cosmological zoom-in simulations of MW-mass galaxies in the E-MOSAICS project, which self-consistently model the formation and evolution of GC populations in a cosmological context, we find that the MW assembled quickly for its mass, reaching \${\textbackslash}\{25,50{\textbackslash}\}{\textbackslash}\%\$ of its present-day halo mass already at \$z={\textbackslash}\{3,1.5{\textbackslash}\}\$ and half of its present-day stellar mass at \$z=1.2\$. We reconstruct the MW's merger tree from its GC age-metallicity distribution, inferring the number of mergers as a function of mass ratio and redshift. These statistics place the MW's assembly \${\textbackslash}textit\{rate\}\$ among the 72th-94th percentile of the E-MOSAICS galaxies, whereas its \${\textbackslash}textit\{integrated\}\$ properties (e.g. number of mergers, halo concentration) match the median of the simulations. We conclude that the MW has experienced no major mergers (mass ratios \${\textgreater}\$1:4) since \$z{\textbackslash}sim4\$, sharpening previous limits of \$z{\textbackslash}sim2\$. We identify three massive satellite progenitors and constrain their mass growth and enrichment histories. Two are proposed to correspond to Sagittarius (few \$10{\textasciicircum}8{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) and the GCs formerly associated with Canis Major (\${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}9{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$). The third satellite has no known associated relic and was likely accreted between \$z=0.6\$-\$1.3\$. We name this enigmatic galaxy \${\textbackslash}textit\{Kraken\}\$ and propose that it is the most massive satellite (\$M\_*{\textbackslash}sim2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}9{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) ever accreted by the MW. We predict that \${\textbackslash}sim40{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the Galactic GCs formed ex-situ (in galaxies with masses \$M\_*=2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}7\$-\$2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}9{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), with \$6{\textbackslash}pm1\$ being former nuclear clusters.},

	abstract = {In this work we present two new \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}9\$ particle self-consistent simulations of the merger of a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy with a Milky Way-like disc galaxy. One model is a violent merger creating a thick disc, and a Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage like remnant. The other is a highly stable disc which we use to illustrate how the improved phase space resolution allows us to better examine the formation and evolution of structures that have been observed in small, local volumes in the Milky Way, such as the \$z-v\_z\$ phase spiral and clustering in the \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\}\}-v\_\{{\textbackslash}phi\}\$ plane when compared to previous works. The local \$z-v\_z\$ phase spirals are clearly linked to the global asymmetry across the disc: we find both 2-armed and 1-armed phase spirals, which are related to breathing and bending behaviors respectively. Hercules-like moving groups are common, clustered in \$v\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\}\}-v\_\{{\textbackslash}phi\}\$ in local data samples in the simulation. These groups migrate outwards from the inner galaxy, matching observed metallicity trends even in the absence of a galactic bar.

Here we present a study of the variation in the stellar halos of galaxies, using data from the Dragonfly Nearby Galaxies Survey (DNGS). The survey consists of wide field, deep (\${\textbackslash}mu\_\{g\} {\textgreater} 31\$ mag arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$) optical imaging of nearby galaxies using the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. Our sample includes eight spiral galaxies with stellar masses similar to that of the Milky Way, inclinations of \$16-90\$ degrees and distances between \$7-18\$ Mpc. We construct stellar mass surface density profiles from the observed \$g\$-band surface brightness in combination with the \$g-r\$ color as a function of radius, and compute the halo fractions from the excess stellar mass (relative to a disk\$+\$bulge fit) beyond \$5\$ half-mass radii. We find a mean halo fraction of \$0.009 {\textbackslash}pm 0.005\$ and a large RMS scatter of \$1.01{\textasciicircum}\{+0.9\}\_\{-0.26\}\$ dex. The peak-to-peak scatter is a factor of \${\textgreater}100\$ -- while some galaxies feature strongly structured halos resembling that of M31, three of the eight have halos that are completely undetected in our data. We conclude that spiral galaxies as a class exhibit a rich variety in stellar halo properties, implying that their assembly histories have been highly non-uniform. We find no convincing evidence for an environmental or stellar mass dependence of the halo fraction in the sample.},

	abstract = {Using SDSS Stripe82 data we have obtained deep radial surface brightness profiles of 7 face-on to intermediate inclined late-type spirals down to {\textbackslash}sim 30 mag arcsec{\textasciicircum}-2 in the r'-band. We do not find any evidence for a sharp cut-off of the light distribution of the disks but a smooth continuation into the stellar halos of galaxies. Stellar halos start to affect the surface brightness profiles of the galaxies at {\textbackslash}sim 28 mag arcsec{\textasciicircum}-2, and at a radial distance of {\textbackslash}sim 4-10 inner scale-lengths. We find that the light contribution from the stellar halo could be responsible of previous classification of surface brightness profiles as Type III in late-type galaxies. In order to estimate the contribution of the stellar halo light to the total galaxy light, we carried out a Bulge/Disk/Stellar Halo decomposition by simoultaneously fitting all components. The light contribution of the halo to the total galaxy light varies from {\textasciitilde} 1\% to {\textasciitilde} 5\%, but in case of ongoing mergers, the halo light fraction can be as high as {\textasciitilde} 10\%, independently of the luminosities of the galaxies. We have also explored the integrated (g'-r') color of the stellar halo of our galaxies. We find (g'-r') colors ranging from {\textasciitilde} 0.4 to {\textasciitilde} 1.2. By confronting these colors with model predictions, we encounter problems to fit our very red colors onto stellar population grids with conventional IMFs. Very red halo colors can be attributed to stellar populations dominated by very low mass stars of low to intermediate metallicity produced by bottom-heavy IMFs.},

	abstract = {We explore the inter-relationships between mass, star-formation rate and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS and other surveys. The differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z {\textasciitilde} 1, indicating that two distinct processes are operating, "mass-quenching" and "environment-quenching". Environment-quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z {\textasciitilde} 1, suggesting that it occurs as large-scale structure develops in the Universe. The observed constancy of the mass-function shape for star-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around and above M*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z {\textless} 2. We postulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broader range of stellar mass and epoch. These two simple quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) a quasi-static Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value of M* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation and mass-quenching rates, (b) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, while the other is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and alpha as the star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, slightly increasing M* and making alpha more negative. All of these detailed quantitative relationships between the Schechter parameters are indeed seen in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically-based model. The model naturally produces for passive galaxies the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean ages and alpha-element abundances with mass.},

This indicates that both in this rich cluster and in the general field, neutral hydrogen is primarily associated with late-type galaxies, with marginal contributions from early-type galaxies and isolated HI clouds. The inconsistency between the cluster and the field HIMF derives primarily from the difference in the optical luminosity function of late-type galaxies in the two environments, combined with the HI deficiency that is known to occur in galaxies in rich clusters.},

These three galaxies show clear evidence of ram pressure stripping due to the cluster medium as found in previous HI imaging studies. Using high-resolution CO data, we investigate how the properties of the inner molecular gas disc change while a galaxy is undergoing HI stripping in the cluster. At given sensitivity limits, we do not find any clear signs of molecular gas stripping. However, both its morphology and kinematics appear to be quite disturbed as those of HI. Morphological peculiarities present in the molecular and atomic gas are closely related with each other, suggesting that molecular gas can be also affected by strong ICM pressure even if it is not stripped. CO is found to be modestly enhanced along the upstream sides in these galaxies, which may change the local star formation activity in the disc. Indeed, the distribution of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission, a tracer of recent star formation, well coincides with that of the molecular gas, revealing enhancements near the local CO peak or along the CO compression. FUV and H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ share some properties in common, but FUV is always more extended than CO/H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ in the three galaxies, implying that the star-forming disc is rapidly shrinking as the molecular gas properties have changed. We discuss how ICM pressure affects dense molecular gas and hence star formation properties while diffuse atomic gas is being removed from a galaxy.},

Modern simulations model dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in an expanding space-time starting from well-defined initial conditions. The modeling of ordinary matter is most challenging due to the large array of physical processes affecting this matter component.

Our numerical models, taking into account both dynamical and chemical evolution processes in a consistent manner, are aimed at explaining observed structure and kinematics of the stellar halo in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation. The main results of the present simulations are summarized as follows. (1) Basic physical processes involved in the formation of the stellar halo, composed of metal-deficient stars with [Fe/H] \${\textbackslash}le\$ -1.0, are described by both dissipative and dissipationless merging of subgalactic clumps and their resultant tidal disruption in the course of gravitational contraction of the Galaxy at high redshift (\$z\$ \${\textgreater}\$ 1). (2) The simulated halo has the density profile similar to the observed power-law form of \${\textbackslash}rho (r)\$ \${\textbackslash}sim\$ \$r{\textasciicircum}\{-3.5\}\$, and has also the similar metallicity distribution to the observations. The halo virtually shows no radial gradient for stellar ages and only small gradient for metallicities. (3) The dual nature of the halo, i.e., its inner flattened and outer spherical density distribution, is reproduced, at least qualitatively, by the present model. The outer spherical halo is formed via essentially dissipationless merging of small subgalactic clumps, whereas the inner flattened one is formed via three different mechanisms, i.e., dissipative merging between larger, more massive clumps, adiabatic contraction due to the growing Galactic disk, and gaseous accretion onto the equatorial plane.},

This faint feature was first detected in early photographic studies by van der Kruit (1979); more recently by Mart{\textbackslash}'inez-Delgado et al. (2010) and as presented in this work, the loop has been realized to be the result of a recent minor merger through evidence obtained by deep images taken with a telescope of only 0.16 m aperture. The stellar stream is confirmed in additional images taken with the 0.5 m of the BlackBird Remote Observatory and the 0.8 m of the McDonald Observatory. This low surface brightness structure around the disk of the galaxy extends {\textasciitilde}29 kpc from its center, with a projected width of 3.3 kpc. The stream's morphology is consistent with that of the visible part of a "great-circle" stellar stream originating from the accretion of a {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_sun dwarf satellite in the last few Gyr. The progenitor satellite's current position and fate are not conclusive from our data. The color of the stream's stars is consistent with Local Group dwarfs and is similar to the outer regions of M63's disk and stellar halo. We detect other low surface brightness "plumes"; some of these may be extended spiral features related to the galaxy's complex spiral structure and others may be tidal debris associated with the disruption of the galaxy's outer stellar disk as a result of the accretion event. We differentiate between features related to the tidal stream and faint, blue features in the outskirts of the galaxy's disk previously detected by the GALEX satellite. With its highly warped HI gaseous disk ({\textasciitilde}20 deg), M63 represents one of several examples of an isolated spiral galaxy with a warped disk showing strong evidence of an ongoing minor merger.},

	abstract = {We consider the orbital evolution of satellites in galaxy mergers, focusing on the evolution of eccentricity. Using a large suite of N-body simulations, we study a previously unexplored phenomenon of satellite orbital radialization, i.e., a profound increase in the eccentricity of satellite's orbit as it decays under dynamical friction. While radialization is detected in a variety of different setups, we find that it is most efficient in the cases of high satellite mass, moderately steep host density profiles and high initial eccentricity. To understand the origin of this phenomenon, we run additional simulations with various physical factors selectively turned off: satellite mass loss, reflex motion and distortion of the host, etc. We find that all these factors are important for radialization, since it does not occur for point-mass satellites or when the host potential is replaced with an unperturbed initial profile. The analysis of forces and torques acting on both galaxies confirms the major role of self-gravity of both host and satellite in the reduction of orbital angular momentum. The classical Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula, which accounts only for the forces between the host and the satellite, but not for internal distortions of both galaxies, does not match the evolution of eccentricity observed in \$N\$-body simulations.},

	abstract = {The time-scale for galaxies within merging dark matter haloes to merge with each other is an important ingredient in galaxy formation models. Accurate estimates of merging time-scales are required for predictions of astrophysical quantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass in central galaxies and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies within dark matter haloes. In this paper, we study the merging time-scales of extended dark matter haloes using N-body simulations. We compare these results to standard estimates based on the Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction. We ﬁnd that these standard predictions for merging time-scales, which are often used in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter than those found in simulations. The discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7 for Msat/Mhost ≈ 0.1 and becomes larger for more disparate satellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of ∼3.3 for Msat/Mhost ≈ 0.01. Based on our simulations, we propose a new, easily implementable ﬁtting formula that accurately predicts the time-scale for an extended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to the halo’s centre for a wide range of Msat/Mhost and orbits. Including a central bulge in each galaxy changes the merging time-scale by 10 per cent. To highlight one concrete application of our results, we show that merging time-scales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar mass by satellite accretion by ≈40 per cent, with the extra mass gained in low mass ratio mergers.},

	abstract = {We present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidal disruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. Our model is based on the Aquarius project, a suite of high resolution N-body simulations of individual dark matter haloes. We tag subsets of particles in these simulations with stellar populations predicted by the Galform semi-analytic model. Our method self-consistently tracks the dynamical evolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. The luminosity function and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree well with observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. We find that accreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1{\textless}z{\textless}7 from less than 5 significant progenitors. These progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites with stellar masses similar to the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidals. In contrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of these major contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. Both the number of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherently stochastic. This results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, which amplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halo hosts. The masses and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloes are consistent with expectations from the Milky Way and M31. Each halo has a complex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shells and other subcomponents. This structure is not adequately described by smooth models. We find one example of an accreted thick disk. Contrasts in age and metallicity between halo stars and those in surviving satellites are in broad agreement with recent observations. [Abridged]},

	abstract = {We describe the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, a robotic imaging system optimized for the detection of extended ultra low surface brightness structures. The array consists of eight Canon 400mm f/2.8 telephoto lenses coupled to eight science-grade commercial CCD cameras. The lenses are mounted on a common framework and are co-aligned to image simultaneously the same position on the sky. The system provides an imaging capability equivalent to a 0.4m aperture f/1.0 refractor with a 2.6 deg X 1.9 deg field of view. The system has no obstructions in the light path, optimized baffling, and internal optical surfaces coated with a new generation of anti-reflection coatings based on sub-wavelength nanostructures. As a result, the array's point spread function has a factor of {\textasciitilde}10 less scattered light at large radii than well-baffled reflecting telescopes. The Dragonfly Telephoto Array is capable of imaging extended structures to surface brightness levels below 30 mag/arcsec{\textasciicircum}2 in 10h integrations (without binning or foreground star removal). This is considerably deeper than the surface brightness limit of any existing wide-field telescope. At present no systematic errors limiting the usefulness of much longer integration times has been identified. With longer integrations (50-100h), foreground star removal and modest binning the Dragonfly Telephoto Array is capable of probing structures with surface brightnesses below 32 mag/arcsec{\textasciicircum}2. Detection of structures at these surface brightness levels may hold the key to solving the "missing substructure" and "missing satellite" problems of conventional hierarchical galaxy formation models. The Dragonfly Telephoto Array is therefore executing a fully-automated multi-year imaging survey of a complete sample of nearby galaxies in order to undertake the first census of ultra-faint substructures in the nearby Universe.},

We ﬁnd that dark matter is always stripped far more signiﬁcantly than the stars—galaxies that lose ∼80\% of their dark matter, typically lose only 10\% of their stars. This is because the dark matter halo is initially much more extended than the stars. As such, we ﬁnd thatthe stellarto-halo size-ratio (measured using reff/rvir) is a key parameter controlling the relative amounts of dark matter and stellar stripping. We use simple ﬁtting formulae to measure the relation between the fraction of bound dark matter and thefraction of bound stars. We measure a negligible dependence on cluster mass or galaxy mass. Therefore, these formulae have general applicability in cosmological simulations, and are ideal to improve stellar stripping recipes in semi-analytical models, and/or to estimate the impact that tidal stripping would have on galaxies when only their halo mass evolution is known.},

	abstract = {The interplay between cosmic gas accretion on to galaxies and galaxy mergers drives the observed morphological diversity of galaxies. By comparing the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulations Horizon-AGN and Horizon-noAGN, we unambiguously identify the critical role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in setting up the correct galaxy morphology for the massive end of the population. With AGN feedback, typical kinematic and morpho-metric properties of galaxy populations as well as the galaxy-halo mass relation are in much better agreement with observations. Only AGN feedback allows massive galaxies at the centre of groups and clusters to become ellipticals, while without AGN feedback those galaxies reform discs. It is the merger-enhanced AGN activity that is able to freeze the morphological type of the post-merger remnant by durably quenching its quiescent star formation. Hence morphology is shown to be driven not only by mass but also by the nature of cosmic accretion: at constant galaxy mass, ellipticals are galaxies that are mainly assembled through mergers, while discs are preferentially built from the in situ star formation fed by smooth cosmic gas infall.},

However, Simba also yields an insufficiently sharp truncation of the z=0 mass function, and too-large sizes for low-mass quenched galaxies.

	abstract = {(Abridged) We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). A vast array of science will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will have unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at Cerro Pach{\textbackslash}'\{o\}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel camera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second exposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given night. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000 square degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ point-source depth in a single visit in \$r\$ will be \${\textbackslash}sim 24.5\$ (AB). The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ with \${\textbackslash}delta{\textless}+34.5{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, \$ugrizy\$, covering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90{\textbackslash}\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to \$r{\textbackslash}sim27.5\$. The remaining 10{\textbackslash}\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a Very Deep and Fast time domain survey. The goal is to make LSST data products, including a relational database of about 32 trillion observations of 40 billion objects, available to the public and scientists around the world.},

A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent “boosting” paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion.Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such “TreeBoost” models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

Previous work has shown that the stellar halo density falls off much more rapidly beyond this break radius. We argue that the correspondence between the apocenters of high metallicity, high eccentricity stars and the broken density profile is caused by the build-up of stars at the apocenter of a common dwarf progenitor. Although the radially biased stars are likely present down to metallicities of [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -2 the increasing dominance at higher metallicities suggests a massive dwarf progenitor, which is at least as massive as the Fornax and Sagittarius dwarf galaxies, and is likely the dominant progenitor of the inner stellar halo.},

Here we show how present-day 10 meter class telescopes can provide broadband imaging 1.5-2 mag deeper than most previous results within a reasonable amount of time (i.e. {\textless}10h on source integration). In particular, we illustrate the ability of the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC) telescope to produce imaging with a limiting surface brightness of 31.5 mag/arcsec{\textasciicircum}2 (3sigma in 10x10 arcsec boxes; r-band) using 8.1 hours on source. We apply this power to explore the stellar halo of the galaxy UGC00180, a galaxy analogous to M31 located at {\textasciitilde}150 Mpc, by obtaining a surface brightness radial profile down to mu\_r{\textasciitilde}33 mag/arcsec{\textasciicircum}2. This depth is similar to that obtained using star counts techniques of Local Group galaxies, but is achieved at a distance where this technique is unfeasible. We find that the mass of the stellar halo of this galaxy is {\textasciitilde}4x10{\textasciicircum}9 Msun, i.e. 3+-1\% of the total stellar mass of the whole system. This amount of mass in the stellar halo is in agreement with current theoretical expectations for galaxies of this kind.},

	abstract = {We have constructed an extended composite luminosity profile for the Andromeda galaxy, M31, and have decomposed it into three basic luminous structural components: a bulge, a disk and a halo. The dust-free Spitzer/IRAC imaging and extended spatial coverage of ground-based optical imaging and deep star counts allow us to map M31's structure from its center to 22 kpc along the major axis. We apply different decomposition methods for the 1D luminosity profiles and 2D images. These include non-linear least-squares and Bayesian Monte-Carlo Markov-chain analyses. The basic photometric model for M31 has a Sersic bulge with shape index n = 2.2 +/- 0.3 and effective radius R\_e = 1.0 +/- 0.2 kpc, a dust-free exponential disk of scale length R\_d = 5.3 +/- 0.5 kpc; the parameter errors reflect the range between various decomposition methods. The bulge parameter, n, is rather insensitive to bandpass effects and its value suggests a first rapid formation via mergers followed by secular growth from the disk. The M31 halo has a 2D power-law index {\textasciitilde} -2.5 +/- 0.2. We find that the M31 bulge light is mostly dominant over the range R\_minor {\textless} 1.2 kpc. The disk takes over in the range 1.2 kpc {\textless} R\_minor {\textless} 9 kpc, whereas the halo dominates at R\_minor {\textgreater} 9 kpc. The stellar nucleus, bulge, disk, and halo components each contribute roughly 0.05\%, 23\%, 73\% and 4\% of the total light of M31 out to 200 kpc along the minor axis. Nominal errors for the structural parameters of the M31 bulge, disk and halo amount to 20\%. If M31 and the Milky Way are at all typical, faint stellar halos should be routinely detected in galaxy surveys reaching below mu\_i {\textasciitilde} 27 mag/arcsec{\textasciicircum}2. We stress that our results rely on this photometric analysis alone. Structural parameters may change when other fundamental constraints, such as those provided by abundance gradients and stellar kinematics, are considered simultaneously (Abridged).},

	abstract = {Previous studies have found that the elemental abundances of a star correlate directly with its age and metallicity. Using this knowledge, we derive ages for a sample of 250,000 stars taken from GALAH DR3 using only their overall metallicity and chemical abundances. Stellar ages are estimated via the machine learning algorithm \$XGBoost\$, using main sequence turnoff stars with precise ages as our input training set. We find that the stellar ages for the bulk of the GALAH DR3 sample are accurate to 1-2 Gyr using this method. With these ages, we replicate many recent results on the age-kinematic trends of the nearby disk, including the age-velocity dispersion relationship of the solar neighborhood and the larger global velocity dispersion relations of the disk found using \$Gaia\$ and GALAH. The fact that chemical abundances alone can be used to determine a reliable age for a star have profound implications for the future study of the Galaxy as well as upcoming spectroscopic surveys. These results show that the chemical abundance variation at a given birth radius is quite small, and imply that strong chemical tagging of stars directly to birth clusters may prove difficult with our current elemental abundance precision. Our results highlight the need of spectroscopic surveys to deliver precision abundances for as many nucleosynthetic production sites as possible in order to estimate reliable ages for stars directly from their chemical abundances. Applying the methods outlined in this paper opens a new door into studies of the kinematic structure and evolution of the disk, as ages may potentially be estimated for a large fraction of stars in existing spectroscopic surveys. This would yield a sample of millions of stars with reliable age determinations, and allow precise constraints to be put on various kinematic processes in the disk, such as the efficiency and timescales of radial migration.},

	shorttitle = {Stellar streams and dark substructure},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13420},
	abstract = {The cold dark matter picture predicts an abundance of substructure within the Galactic halo. However, most substructures host no stars and can only be detected indirectly. Stellar streams present a promising probe of this dark substructure. These streams arise from tidally stripped star clusters or dwarf galaxies, and their low dynamical temperature and negligible self-gravity give them a sharp memory of gravitational perturbations caused by passing dark substructures. For this reason, perturbed stellar streams have been the subject of substantial study. While previous studies have been largely numerical, we show here that in the diffusion regime -- where stream stars are subjected to many small velocity kicks -- stream perturbations can be understood on a fully analytic level. In particular, we derive how the (three-dimensional) power spectrum of the substructure density field determines the power spectrum of the (one-dimensional) density of a stellar stream. Our analytic description supplies a clear picture of the behaviour of stream perturbations in response to a perturbing environment, which may include contributions from both dark and luminous substructure. In particular, stream perturbations grow in amplitude initially, settle into a steady state, and ultimately decay. By directly relating stellar stream perturbations to the surrounding matter distribution, this analytic framework represents a versatile new tool for probing the nature of dark matter through astrophysical observations.},

	abstract = {Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are the lowest-surface brightness galaxies known, with typical stellar masses of dwarf galaxies but sizes similar to larger galaxies like the Milky Way. The reason for their extended sizes is debated, with suggested internal processes like angular momentum, feedback or mergers versus external mechanisms or a combination of both. Observationally, we know that UDGs are red and quiescent in groups and clusters while their counterparts in the field are blue and star-forming. This dichotomy suggests environmental effects as main culprit. However, this scenario is challenged by recent observations of isolated quiescent UDGs in the field. Here we use \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to show that isolated quenched UDGs are formed as backsplash galaxies that were once satellites of another galactic, group or cluster halo but are today a few Mpc away from them. These interactions, albeit brief, remove the gas and tidally strip the outskirts of the dark matter haloes of the now quenched seemingly-isolated UDGs, which are born as star-forming field UDGs occupying dwarf-mass dark matter haloes. Quiescent UDGs may therefore be found in non-negligible numbers in filaments and voids, bearing the mark of past interactions as stripped outer haloes devoid of dark matter and gas compared to dwarfs with similar stellar content.},

They are a natural product of the merging processes that probably take place during the assembly of a galaxy, and hence may well be the most ubiquitous component of galaxies, independently of their Hubble type. This review focuses on our current understanding of the spatial structure, the kinematics and chemistry of halo stars in the Milky Way. In recent years, we have experienced a change in paradigm thanks to the discovery of large amounts of substructure, especially in the outer halo. I discuss the implications of the currently available observational constraints and fold them into several possible formation scenarios. Unraveling the formation of the Galactic halo will be possible in the near future through a combination of large wide ﬁeld photometric and spectroscopic surveys, and especially in the era of Gaia.},

However, it is unlikely that these dwarfs have undergone a sufficient number of minor mergers to form stellar halos that are composed of predominantly accreted stars. Here, we demonstrate that FIRE-2 (Feedback in Realistic Environments) cosmological zoom-in simulations are capable of producing dwarf galaxies with realistic structure, including both a thick disk and round stellar halo. Crucially, these stellar halos are formed in-situ, largely via the outward migration of disk stars. However, there also exists a large population of "non-disky" dwarfs in FIRE that lack a well-defined disk/halo and do not resemble the observed dwarf population. These non-disky dwarfs tend to be either more gas poor or to have burstier recent star formation histories than the disky dwarfs, suggesting that star formation feedback may be preventing disk formation. Both classes of dwarfs underscore the power of a galaxy's intrinsic shape -- which is a direct quantification of the distribution of the galaxy's stellar content -- to interrogate the feedback implementation in simulated galaxies.},

We use high-resolution simulations of Galaxy-analogue systems to show that these mergers can dynamically eject disc stars into a diffuse light component that resembles a stellar halo both spatially and kinematically. For a variety of initial orbital configurations, we find that ∼3–5 × 108 M⊙ of primary stellar disc material is ejected to a distance larger than 5 kpc above the Galactic plane. This ejected contribution is similar to the mass contributed by the tidal disruption of the satellite galaxy itself, though it is less extended. If we restrict our analysis to the approximate solar neighbourhood in the disc plane, we find that ∼1 per cent of the initial disc stars in that region would be classified kinematically as halo stars. Our results suggest that the inner parts of galactic stellar haloes contain ancient disc stars and that these stars may have been liberated in the very same events that delivered material to the outer stellar halo.},

	abstract = {Two ultra diffuse galaxies in the same group, NGC1052-DF2 and NGC1052-DF4, have been found to have little or no dark matter and to host unusually luminous globular cluster populations. Such low mass diffuse objects in a group environment are easily disrupted and are expected to show evidence of tidal distortions. In this work we present deep new imaging of the NGC1052 group obtained with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to test this hypothesis. We find that both galaxies show strong position angle twists and are significantly more elongated in their outskirts than in their interiors. The group's central massive elliptical NGC1052 is the most likely source of these tidal disturbances. The observed distortions imply that the galaxies have a very low total mass; otherwise, they must be very close to NGC1052. Taking into account a recently derived lower limit on the relative line-of-sight distance between NGC1052-DF2 and NGC1052-DF4 from the tip of the red giant branch stars, we infer that the dark matter halo masses of these galaxies cannot be much greater than their stellar masses. Our findings provide strong evidence, completely independent of kinematic constraints, that both galaxies are indeed dark matter deficient. While tidal distortions do not directly provide new information on the formation of NGC1052-DF2 and NGC1052-DF4, the similarity of their tidal features suggests that they are at comparable distances from NGC1052.},

MW/M31-like analogues are defined as disky galaxies with stellar masses of Mstar = 10{\textasciicircum}10.5-11.2 Msun in relative isolation at z = 0. By defining satellites as galaxies with Mstar {\textgreater} 5*10{\textasciicircum}6 Msun within 300 kpc (3D) of their host, we find a remarkable level of diversity and host-to-host scatter across individual host galaxies. The median (16th - 84th percentiles) TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxy hosts a total of 5 (2-11) satellites with Mstar {\textgreater} 5*10{\textasciicircum}6 Msun, reaching up to Mstar {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}8.5 Msun (10{\textasciicircum}7.4-9.4 Msun). The abundance of subhaloes with Mdyn {\textgreater} 5*10{\textasciicircum}7 Msun is larger by a factor of more than 10. The number of all satellites (subhaloes) ever accreted is larger by a factor of 4-5 (3-5) than those surviving to z = 0. Hosts with larger galaxy stellar mass, brighter K-band luminosity, larger total halo mass, and more recent halo assembly typically have a larger number of surviving satellites. The satellite abundances around TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxies are consistent with similar hosts from observational surveys (e.g. SAGA) and previous simulations (e.g. Latte). While the observed MW satellite system falls within the TNG50 scatter across all stellar masses considered, M31 is slightly more satellite-rich than our 1 sigma scatter, possibly due to volume and mass limitations. We find a handful of systems with both a Large and a Small Magellanic Cloud-like satellite. There is no missing satellites problem with TNG50.},

	abstract = {Several lines of evidence suggest the Milky Way underwent a major merger at z{\textasciitilde}2 with a galaxy known as Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). Here we use H3 Survey data to argue that GSE entered the Galaxy on a retrograde orbit based on a population of highly retrograde stars with chemistry similar to the largely radial GSE debris. We present the first tailored, high-resolution N-body simulations of the merger. From a grid of {\textasciitilde}500 simulations we find a GSE with \$M\_\{*\}=5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}{\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{DM\}\}=2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (a 2.5:1 total mass merger) best matches the H3 data. This simulation shows the retrograde GSE stars are stripped from its outer disk early in the merger before the orbit loses significant angular momentum. Despite being selected purely on angular momenta and radial distributions, this simulation reproduces and explains the following empirical phenomena: (i) the elongated, triaxial shape of the inner halo (axis ratios \$10:7.9:4.5\$), whose major axis is at {\textasciitilde}35\{{\textbackslash}deg\} to the plane and connects GSE's apocenters, (ii) the Hercules-Aquila Cloud \& the Virgo Overdensity, which arise due to apocenter pile-up, (iii) the 2 Gyr lag between the quenching of GSE and the truncation of the age distribution of the in-situ halo, which tracks the 2 Gyr gap between the first and final GSE pericenters. We make the following predictions: (i) the inner halo has a "double-break" density profile with breaks at both {\textasciitilde}15-18 kpc and 30 kpc, coincident with the GSE apocenters, (ii) the outer halo has retrograde streams containing {\textasciitilde}10\% of GSE stars awaiting discovery at {\textgreater}30 kpc. The retrograde (radial) GSE debris originates from its outer (inner) disk -- exploiting this trend we reconstruct the stellar metallicity gradient of GSE (\$-0.04{\textbackslash}pm0.01\$ dex \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{50\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$). These simulations imply GSE delivered {\textasciitilde}20\% of the Milky Way's present-day dark matter and {\textasciitilde}50\% of its stellar halo. (ABRIDGED)},

	abstract = {We use mock images of \$z=0.1\$ galaxies in the 100 Mpc EAGLE simulation to establish the differences between the sizes and morphologies inferred from the stellar mass distributions and the optical light distributions. The optical, \$r\$-band images used were constructed with a radiative transfer method to account for the effects of dust, and we measure galaxy structural parameters by fitting S{\textbackslash}'ersic models to the images with Galfit. We find that the derived \$r\$-band half-light radii differ systematically from the stellar half-mass radii, as the \$r\$-band sizes are typically 0.1 dex larger, and can deviate by as much as \${\textbackslash}approx0.5\$ dex. The magnitude of this size discrepancy depends strongly on the dust attenuation and star formation activity within the galaxy, as well as the measurement method used. Consequently, we demonstrate that the \$r\$-band sizes significantly improve the agreement between the simulated and observed stellar mass-size relation: star-forming and quiescent galaxies in EAGLE are typically only slightly larger than observed in the GAMA survey (by 0.1 dex), and the slope and scatter of the local mass-size relation are reproduced well for both populations. Finally, we also compare the obtained morphologies with measurements from GAMA, finding that too few EAGLE galaxies have light profiles that are similar to local early-type galaxies (S{\textbackslash}'ersic indices of \$n{\textbackslash}sim 4\$). Despite the presence of a significant population of triaxial systems among the simulated galaxies, the surface brightness and stellar mass density profiles tend to be closer to exponential discs (\$n{\textbackslash}sim1-2\$).

	abstract = {In the standard disk galaxy formation model, the sizes of galactic disks are tightly related to the spin parameters \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ of their dark matter haloes. The model has been wildly adopted by various semi-analytic galaxy formation models which have been extremely successful to interpret a large body of observational data. However, the size-\${\textbackslash}lambda\$ correlation was rarely seen in most modern hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. In this short paper, we make use of 4 sets of large hydrodynamical simulations to explore the size-spin parameter relation with a large sample of simulated disk galaxies, and compare it with a popular disk galaxy formation model of Mo et al. (1998). Intriguingly, galactic sizes correlate strongly with spin parameters of their dark matter haloes in the simulations developed by the IllustrisTNG collaborations, albeit the relation does not always agree with prediction of MMW98 model over all stellar mass range we examined. There is also a size-spin correlation for the Milky way analogies in the EAGLE simulations, while it is relatively weaker than that of the IllustrisTNG counterparts. For the dwarfs in the simulations from the EAGLE collaboration, there is NULL correlation. We conclude that either the detailed subgrid physics or hydrodynamics solvers account for the size-spin relation, which will be explored in our future work.},

The technique works by replacing multiple low-resolution DM halos in the base cosmological simulation with high-resolution models, including a DM halo and stellar disk. We apply the method to follow the hierarchical build-up of a cluster since redshift \${\textbackslash}sim8\$ to now, through the hierarchical accretion of galaxies, individually or in substructures such as galaxy groups. We find we can successfully reproduce the observed total stellar masses of observed clusters since redshift \${\textbackslash}sim\$1. The high resolution allows us to accurately resolve the tidal stripping process and well describe the formation of ultra-low surface brightness features in the cluster (\${\textbackslash}mu\_\{V\}{\textless}32\$ mag arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$) such as the intracluster light (ICL), shells and tidal streams. We measure the evolution of the fraction of light in the ICL and brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) using several different methods. While their broad response to the cluster mass growth history is similar, the methods show systematic differences, meaning we must be careful when comparing studies that use distinct methods. The GRT represents a powerful new tool for studying tidal effects on galaxies and exploring the formation channels of the ICL in a fully cosmological context and with large samples of simulated groups and clusters.},

We calculate the intrinsic u-r colours and measure the fraction of kinetic energy invested in ordered corotation of 3562 galaxies at z=0 with stellar masses larger than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We perform a visual inspection of gri-composite images and find that our kinematic morphology correlates strongly with visual morphology. EAGLE produces a galaxy population for which morphology is tightly correlated with the location in the colour- mass diagram, with the red sequence mostly populated by elliptical galaxies and the blue cloud by disc galaxies. Satellite galaxies are more likely to be on the red sequence than centrals, and for satellites the red sequence is morphologically more diverse. These results show that the connection between mass, intrinsic colour and morphology arises from galaxy formation models that reproduce the observed galaxy mass function and sizes.},

	abstract = {Different stellar sub-populations of the Milky Way's stellar disk are known to have different vertical scale heights, their thickness increasing with age. Using SEGUE spectroscopic survey data, we have recently shown that mono-abundance sub-populations, defined in the [α/Fe]–[Fe/H] space, are well described by single-exponential spatial-density profiles in both the radial and the vertical direction; therefore, any star of a given abundance is clearly associated with a sub-population of scale height hz. Here, we work out how to determine the stellar surface-mass density contributions at the solar radius R0 of each such sub-population, accounting for the survey selection function, and for the fraction of the stellar population mass that is reflected in the spectroscopic target stars given populations of different abundances and their presumed age distributions. Taken together, this enables us to derive , the surface-mass contributions of stellar populations with scale height hz. Surprisingly, we find no hint of a thin–thick disk bi-modality in this mass-weighted scale-height distribution, but a smoothly decreasing function, approximately , from hz ≈ 200 pc to hz ≈ 1 kpc. As hz is ultimately the structurally defining property of a thin or thick disk, this shows clearly that the Milky Way has a continuous and monotonic distribution of disk thicknesses: there is no “thick disk” sensibly characterized as a distinct component. We discuss how our result is consistent with evidence for seeming bi-modality in purely geometric disk decompositions or chemical abundances analyses. We constrain the total visible stellar surface–mass density at the solar radius to be pc−2.},

We use a subsample of eighteen cosmological zoom-in simulations from the NIHAO project to derive a robust method for defining stellar kinematic discs in galaxies. Our method uses Gaussian Mixture Models in a 3D space of dynamical variables. The NIHAO galaxies have the right stellar mass for their halo mass, and their angular momenta and S{\textbackslash}'ersic indices match observations. While the photometric disc-to-total ratios are close to 1 for all the simulated galaxies, the kinematic ratios are around {\textasciitilde}0.5. Thus, exponential structure does not imply a cold kinematic disc. Above log(M*){\textasciitilde}9.5, the decomposition leads to thin discs and spheroids that have clearly different properties, in terms of angular momentum, rotational support, ellipticity, [Fe/H] and [O/Fe]. At log(M*){\textless}9.5, the decomposition selects discs and spheroids with less distinct properties. At these low masses, both the discs and spheroids have exponential profiles with high minor-to-major axes ratios, i.e. thickened discs.},

	abstract = {We study the z = 0 gas kinematics, morphology, and angular momentum content of isolated galaxies in a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE project spanning Mstar = 106−11M . Gas becomes increasingly rotationally supported with increasing galaxy mass. In the lowest-mass galaxies (Mstar {\textless} 108 M ), gas fails to form a morphological disk and is primarily dispersion and pressure supported. At intermediate masses (Mstar = 108−10 M ), galaxies display a wide range of gas kinematics and morphologies, from thin, rotating disks, to irregular spheroids with negligible net rotation. All the high-mass (Mstar = 1010−11 M ) galaxies form rotationally supported gas disks. Many of the halos whose galaxies fail to form disks harbor high angular momentum gas in their circumgalactic medium. The ratio of the speciﬁc angular momentum of gas in the central galaxy to that of the dark-matter halo increases signiﬁcantly with galaxy mass, from jgas / jDM ∼ 0.1 at Mstar = 106−7M to jgas / jDM ∼ 2 at Mstar = 1010−11 M . The reduced rotational support in the lowest-mass galaxies owes to (a) stellar feedback and the UV background suppressing the accretion of high-angular momentum gas at late times, and (b) stellar feedback driving large non-circular gas motions. We broadly reproduce the observed scaling relations between galaxy mass, gas rotation velocity, size, and angular momentum, but may somewhat underpredict the incidence of disky, high-angular momentum galaxies at the lowest observed masses (Mstar = (106 − 2 × 107) M ). Stars form preferentially from low-angular momentum gas near the galactic centre and are less rotationally supported than gas. The common assumption that stars follow the same rotation curve as gas thus substantially overestimates the simulated galaxies’ stellar angular momentum, particularly at low masses.},

Using mock observations of simulated galaxies from the FIRE project, we show that one can therefore constrain a galaxy’s gas kinematics from its unresolved 21-cm line proﬁle. In particular, we ﬁnd that the kurtosis of the 21-cm line increases with decreasing V/σ, and that this trend is robust across a wide range of masses, signal-to-noise ratios, and inclinations. We then quantify the shapes of 21-cm line proﬁles from a morphologically unbiased sample of ∼2000 low-redshift, HI-detected galaxies with Mstar = 107−11 M and compare to the simulated galaxies. At Mstar 1010 M , both the observed and simulated galaxies produce double-horned proﬁles with low kurtosis and steep wings, consistent with rotation-supported disks. Both the observed and simulated line proﬁles become more Gaussian-like (higher kurtosis and less-steep wings) at lower masses, indicating increased dispersion support. However, the simulated galaxies transition from rotation to dispersion support more strongly: at Mstar = 108−10 M , most of the simulations produce more Gaussian-like proﬁles than typical observed galaxies with similar mass, indicating that gas in the low-mass simulated galaxies is, on average, overly dispersionsupported. Most of the lower-mass simulated galaxies also have somewhat lower gas fractions than the median of the observed population. The simulations nevertheless reproduce the observed line-width baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, which is insensitive to rotation vs. dispersion support.},

While significant progress has been made with recent integral-field spectroscopic surveys of nearby galaxies, much can be learned from analyzing the large sets of realistic galaxies now available through state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We present an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, named auto-GMM, based on Gaussian mixture models, to isolate intrinsic structures in simulated galaxies based on their kinematic phase space. For each galaxy, the number of Gaussian components allowed by the data is determined through a modified Bayesian information criterion. We test our method by applying it to prototype galaxies selected from the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG. Our method can effectively decompose most galactic structures. The intrinsic structures of simulated galaxies can be inferred statistically by non-human supervised identification of galaxy structures. We successfully identify four kinds of intrinsic structures: cold disks, warm disks, bulges, and halos. Our method fails for barred galaxies because of the complex kinematics of particles moving on bar orbits.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13172},
	abstract = {Galactic dynamical structures are fossil records of the assembly histories of galaxies. By analyzing the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, we find that a dynamical structure, which we call the 'inner stellar halo', defined by stars on dynamically hot orbits with circularity \${\textbackslash}lambda\_z {\textless} 0.5\$ at \$3.5{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}{\textless}r {\textbackslash}lesssim 2{\textbackslash},R\_e\$, is a strong indicator of the mass of accreted satellite galaxies. The inner stellar halo is a product of massive and typically ancient mergers, with inner-halo stars in the simulation exhibiting three main physical origins: accreted and stripped from the massive satellites, dynamically heated by mergers from the bulge/disk in the main progenitor, and formed from star formation triggered during the mergers. We find a strong correlation between the mass of this inner stellar halo and the stellar mass of the most massive satellite a galaxy has ever accreted. The correlation is stronger for the mass in stars from all the ever-accreted satellites. These TNG50 correlations are compatible with those predicted by other simulations, e.g. by TNG100 across the whole mass range under study (galaxy stellar masses \$M\_*\$ in the \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10.3-11.6\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ range), by TNG300 for \$M\_* {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and by EAGLE for \$M\_* {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.6\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ galaxies, showing that our predictions are thus robust across different galaxy formation, i.e. feedback, models and hold regardless of numerical resolution. The mass of the inner stellar halo defined in this paper is a quantity that can be robustly obtained for real galaxies by applying a population-orbit superposition method to integral-field-unit spectroscopy data. Hence, this paper shows that IFU observations and dynamical models of the inner regions of galaxies provide a way to quantitatively determine the mass of ancient accreted satellites.},

The first model uses a single dynamical parameter and can distinguish 4 components: thin disc, thick disc, counter-rotating disc and bulge. The second model uses one more dynamical parameter, was defined in a probabilistic manner, and distinguishes two components: bulge and disc. The number fraction of disc-dominated galaxies at a given stellar mass obtained by our models agrees well with observations for masses exceeding \$ {\textbackslash}log\_\{10\}(M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot)=10\$. S{\textbackslash}'ersic indices and half-mass radii for the bulge components agree well with those for real galaxies. The mode of the distribution of S{\textbackslash}'ersic indices for the disc components is at the expected value of \$n=1\$. However, disc half-mass radii are smaller than those for real galaxies, in accordance with previous findings that the IllustrisTNG simulation produces undersized discs.},

We find that \$5\{-\}40\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of the outer (50–300 kpc) stellar halo in each system consists of in-situ stars that were born in outflows from the main galaxy. Outflow stars originate from gas accelerated by superbubble winds, which can be compressed, cool, and form co-moving stars. The majority of these stars remain bound to the halo and fall back with orbital properties similar to the rest of the stellar halo at z = 0. In the outer halo, outflow stars are more spatially homogeneous, metal-rich, and alpha-element-enhanced than the accreted stellar halo. At the solar location, up to \${\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}!10 \{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of our kinematically identified halo stars were born in outflows; the fraction rises to as high as \${\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}!40\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ for the most metal-rich local halo stars ([Fe/H] \&gt;−0.5). Such stars can be retrograde and create features similar to the recently discovered Milky Way ‘Splash’ in phase space. We conclude that the Milky Way stellar halo could contain local counterparts to stars that are observed to form in molecular outflows in distant galaxies. Searches for such a population may provide a new, near-field approach to constraining feedback and outflow physics. A stellar halo contribution from outflows is a phase-reversal of the classic halo formation scenario of Eggen, Lynden-Bell \&amp; Sandange, who suggested that halo stars formed in rapidly infalling gas clouds. Stellar outflows may be observable in direct imaging of external galaxies and could provide a source for metal-rich, extreme-velocity stars in the Milky Way.},

We present a detailed analysis of the stellar halo properties of a statistically representative sample of early-type galaxies from the Illustris simulation, and show that stellar population gradients at large radii can indeed be used to infer basic properties of galactic accretion histories. We measure metallicity, age, and surface-brightness profiles in quiescent Illustris galaxies ranging from = 1010–2 × 1012 and show that they are in reasonable agreement with observations. At fixed mass, galaxies that accreted little of their stellar halo material tend to have steeper metallicity and surface-brightness profiles, between 2–4 effective radii (), than those with larger accreted fractions. Profiles of metallicity and surface-brightness in the stellar halo typically flatten from z = 1 to the present. This suggests that the accretion of stars into the stellar halo tends to flatten metallicity and surface-brightness profiles, a picture which is supported by the tight correlation between the two gradients in the stellar halo. We find no statistical evidence of additional information content related to accretion histories in stellar halo metallicity profiles, beyond what is contained in surface-brightness profiles. Age gradients in the stellar halo do not appear to be sensitive to galactic accretion histories, and none of the stellar population gradients studied are strongly correlated with the mean merger mass-ratio. Our findings relate specifically to regions of the stellar halo within 4 , but suggest that future observations that reach large radii outside galaxies (including to 10 and beyond) will have the best potential to constrain galactic accretion histories.},

Although the halo was once considered a single component, evidence for its dichotomy has slowly emerged in recent years from inspection of small samples of halo objects. Here we show that the halo is indeed clearly divisible into two broadly overlapping structural components—an inner and an outer halo—that exhibit different spatial density profiles, stellar orbits and stellar metallicities (abundances of elements heavier than helium). The inner halo has a modest net prograde rotation, whereas the outer halo exhibits a net retrograde rotation and a peak metallicity one-third that of the inner halo. These properties indicate that the individual halo components probably formed in fundamentally different ways, through successive dissipational (inner) and dissipationless (outer) mergers and tidal disruption of proto-Galactic clumps.},

	abstract = {We present new HI interferometric observations of the gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxy AGC 114905, which previous work, based on low-resolution data, identified as an outlier of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. The new observations, at a spatial resolution \${\textbackslash}sim 2.5\$ times higher than before, reveal a regular HI disc rotating at about 23 km/s. Our kinematic parameters, recovered with a robust 3D kinematic modelling fitting technique, show that the flat part of the rotation curve is reached. Intriguingly, the rotation curve can be explained almost entirely by the baryonic mass distribution alone. We show that a standard cold dark matter halo that follows the concentration-halo mass relation fails to reproduce the amplitude of the rotation curve by a large margin. Only a halo with an extremely (and arguably unfeasible) low concentration reaches agreement with the data. We also find that the rotation curve of AGC 114905 deviates strongly from the predictions of Modified Newtonian dynamics. The inclination of the galaxy, which is measured independently from our modelling, remains the largest uncertainty in our analysis, but the associated errors are not large enough to reconcile the galaxy with the expectations of cold dark matter or Modified Newtonian dynamics.},

We select red giant branch stars to derive stellar halo density profiles. The projected minor axis density profiles can be approximated by power laws with projected slopes of −2 to −3.7 and a diversity of stellar halo masses of 1–6 × 109 M⊙, or 2–14 per cent of the total galaxy stellar masses. The typical intrinsic scatter around a smooth power-law fit is 0.05–0.1 dex owing to substructure. By comparing the minor and major axis profiles, we infer projected axis ratios c/a at ∼25 kpc between 0.4and0.75. The GHOSTS stellar haloes are diverse, lying between the extremes charted out by the (rather atypical) haloes of the MW and M31. We find a strong correlation between the stellar halo metallicities and the stellar halo masses. We compare our results with cosmological models, finding good agreement between our observations and accretion-only models where the stellar haloes are formed by the disruption of dwarf satellites. In particular, the strong observed correlation between stellar halo metallicity and mass is naturally reproduced. Low-resolution hydrodynamical models have unrealistically high stellar halo masses. Current high-resolution hydrodynamical models appear to predict stellar halo masses somewhat higher than observed but with reasonable metallicities, metallicity gradients, and density profiles.},

	abstract = {In the era of large-scale spectroscopic surveys in the Local Group (LG), we can explore using chemical abundances of halo stars to study the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of the dwarf galaxy progenitors of the Milky Way (MW) and M31 stellar halos. In this paper, we investigate using the Chemical Abundance Ratio Distributions (CARDs) of seven stellar halos from the Latte suite of FIRE-2 simulations. We attempt to infer galaxies' assembly histories by modelling the CARDs of the stellar halos of the Latte galaxies as a linear combination of template CARDs from disrupted dwarfs, with different stellar masses \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ and quenching times \$t\_\{100\}\$. We present a method for constructing these templates using present-day dwarf galaxies. For four of the seven Latte halos studied in this work, we recover the mass spectrum of accreted dwarfs to a precision of \${\textless}10{\textbackslash}\%\$. For the fraction of mass accreted as a function of \$t\_\{100\}\$, we find residuals of \$20-30{\textbackslash}\%\$ for five of the seven simulations. We discuss the failure modes of this method, which arise from the diversity of star formation and chemical enrichment histories dwarf galaxies can take. These failure cases can be robustly identified by the high model residuals. Though the CARDs modeling method does not successfully infer the assembly histories in these cases, the CARDs of these disrupted dwarfs contain signatures of their unusual formation histories. Our results are promising for using CARDs to learn more about the histories of the progenitors of the MW and M31 stellar halos.},

	abstract = {Recent spectroscopic observations in the Milky Way suggest that the chemically deﬁned thick disk (stars with high [α/Fe] ratios and thus old) has a signiﬁcantly smaller scale-length than the thin disk. This is in apparent contradiction with observations of external edge-on galaxies, where the thin and thick components have comparable scale-lengths. Moreover, while observed disks do not ﬂare (scaleheight does not increase with radius), numerical simulations suggest that disk ﬂaring is unavoidable, resulting from both environmental eﬀects and secular evolution. Here we address these problems by studying two diﬀerent suites of simulated galactic disks formed in the cosmological context. We show that the scale-heights of coeval populations always increase with radius. However, the total population can be decomposed morphologically into thin and thick disks, which do not ﬂare. We relate this to the disk inside-out formation, where younger populations have increasingly larger scalelengths and ﬂare at progressively larger radii. In this new picture, thick disks are composed of the imbedded ﬂares of mono-age stellar populations. Assuming that disks form inside out, we predict that morphologically deﬁned thick disks must show a decrease in age (or [α/Fe] ratios) with radius and that coeval populations should always ﬂare. This also explains the observed inversion in the metallicity and [α/Fe] gradients for stars away from the disk midplane in the Milky Way. The results of this work are directly linked to, and can be seen as evidence of, inside-out disk growth.},

	title = {A machine learning approach to infer the accreted stellar mass fractions of galaxies},
	abstract = {We propose a random forest (RF) machine learning approach to determine the accreted stellar mass fractions (facc) of central galaxies, based on various dark matter halo and galaxy features. The RF is trained and tested using 2,710 galaxies with stellar mass log10 M∗/M {\textgreater} 10.16 from the TNG100 simulation. For galaxies with log10 M∗/M {\textgreater} 10.6, global features such as halo mass, size and stellar mass are more important in determining facc, whereas for galaxies with log10 M∗/M 10.6, features related to merger histories have higher predictive power. Galaxy size is the most important when calculated in 3-dimensions, which becomes less important after accounting for observational eﬀects. In contrast, the stellar age, galaxy colour and star formation rate carry very limited information about facc. When an entire set of halo and galaxy features are used, the prediction is almost unbiased, with rootmean-square error (RMSE) of ∼0.068. If only using observable features, the RMSE increases to ∼0.104. Nevertheless, compared with the case when only stellar mass is used, the inclusion of other observable features does help to decrease the RMSE by ∼20\%. Lastly, when using galaxy density, velocity and velocity dispersion proﬁles as features, which represent approximately the maximum amount of information one can extract from galaxy images and velocity maps, the prediction is only slightly improved. Hence, with observable features, the limiting precision of predicting facc is ∼0.1, and the multi-component decomposition of galaxy images should have similar or larger uncertainties. If the central black hole mass and the spin parameter of galaxies can be accurately measured in future observations, the RMSE is promising to be further decreased by ∼20\%.},

	abstract = {Relic galaxies are massive compact quiescent galaxies that formed at high-redshift and remained almost unchanged since then. In this work, we search for analogues to relic galaxies in the TNG50 cosmological simulations to understand relic formation and test the ability of TNG50 to reproduce such rare objects. Using stellar mass, age, radius, quiescence and stellar assembly criteria, we find 5 subhalos in TNG50 that could be potential relic analogues. We compare their properties with other constraints imposed by a sample of 13 observed relic galaxies. We find one analogue in TNG50 that simultaneously satisfies most of the available observational constraints, such as metallicity and morphology. It also shows similarities to the confirmed relic NGC 1277, regarding environment and dark matter fraction. By taking into account a degree of relicness, a second relic analogue may also be considered. However, the central parts of the brightness and density profiles of the analogues are less steep than that of real relic galaxies, possibly due to limited numerical resolution. We identify two formation pathways of relic analogues in TNG50 depending on their environment: they either have their remaining gas stripped during the infall into a cluster at \$z {\textbackslash}lesssim 1.2\$ or consume it before \$z {\textgreater} 1.5\$. They are then deprived of significant star formation, leaving their stellar populations almost unaltered during the last 9 Gyr. We also find that the analogue progenitors at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 4\$ inhabit more massive halos than progenitors of quiescent galaxies with similar stellar mass at \$z {\textbackslash}sim 0\$.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) have higher specific frequencies of globular clusters on average than other dwarf galaxies with similar luminosities. The UDG NGC5846-UDG1 is among the most extreme examples of globular cluster-rich galaxies found so far. Here we present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations and analysis of this galaxy and its globular cluster system. We find that NGC5846-UDG1 hosts \$54 {\textbackslash}pm 9\$ globular clusters, three to four times more than any previously known galaxy with a similar luminosity, and higher than reported in previous studies. With a galaxy luminosity of \$L\_\{V,{\textbackslash}mathrm\{gal\}\} {\textbackslash}approx 6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (\$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}approx 1.2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) and a total globular cluster luminosity of \$L\_\{V,{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GCs\}\} {\textbackslash}approx 7.6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}6{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, we find that the clusters currently comprise \${\textbackslash}sim 13 {\textbackslash}\%\$ of the total light. Taking into account the effects of mass loss from clusters during their formation and throughout their lifetime, we infer that most of the stars in the galaxy likely formed in globular clusters, and very little to no "normal" low-density star formation occurred. This result implies that the most extreme conditions during early galaxy formation promoted star formation in massive and dense clumps, in contrast to the dispersed star formation observed in galaxies today.},

Analytic and numerical investigations suggest that this is the most precarious type of merger for the survival of thin galactic disks because more massive accretion events are relatively rare and less massive ones preserve thin disk components. We use high-resolution, dissipationless N-body simulations to study the response of an initially-thin, fully-formed Milky-Way type stellar disk to these cosmologically common events and show that the thin disk does not survive. Regardless of orbital configuration, the impacts transform the disks into structures that are roughly three times as thick and more than twice as kinematically hot as the observed dominant thin disk component of the Milky Way. We conclude that if the Galactic thin disk is a representative case, then the presence of a stabilizing gas component is the only recourse for explaining the preponderance of disk galaxies in an LCDM universe; otherwise, the disk of the Milky Way must be uncommonly cold and thin for its luminosity, perhaps as a consequence of an unusually quiescent accretion history.},

We investigate how the scatter in the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the velocity dispersion - halo mass relation correlates with these stellar population parameters. In addition, we also study the differences when distinguishing between different galaxy morphologies and environments. We find that the ages and chemical enrichment of galaxies are not fully determined by their stellar masses or velocity dispersion, but also depend on the mass of the host halos. Our findings suggest that the velocity dispersion is the best proxy of the stellar population parameters with halo mass playing a secondary yet noticeable role.

In this study we investigate the effect of minor flybys on the bulges, disks, and spiral arms of Milky Way mass galaxies for two types of bulges - classical bulges and boxy/peanut pseudobulges. Our N-body simulations comprise of two disk galaxies of mass ratios 10:1 and 5:1, where the disks of the galaxies lie in their orbital plane and the pericenter distance is varied. We performed photometric and kinematic bulge-disk decomposition at regular time steps and traced the evolution of the disk size, spiral structure, bulge sersic index, bulge mass, and bulge angular momentum. Our results show that the main effect on the disks is disk thickening, which is seen as the increase in the ratio of disk scale height to scale radius. The strength of the spiral structure A2/A0 shows small oscillations about the mean time-varying amplitude in the pseudobulge host galaxies. The flyby has no significant effect on non-rotating classical bulge, which shows that these bulges are extremely stable in galaxy interactions. However, the pseudobulges become dynamically hotter in flybys indicating that flybys may play an important role in accelerating the rate of secular evolution in disk galaxies. This effect on pseudobulges is a result of their rotating nature as part of the bar. Also, flybys do not affect the time and strength of bar buckling.},

	title = {Galaxy mergers can initiate quenching by unlocking an {AGN}-driven transformation of the baryon cycle},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08157},
	abstract = {We use zoom simulations to show how merger-driven disruption of the gas disc in a galaxy provides its central active galactic nucleus (AGN) with fuel to drive outflows that entrain and expel a significant fraction of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). This in turn suppresses replenishment of the interstellar medium, causing the galaxy to quench up to several Gyr after the merger. We start by performing a zoom simulation of a present-day star-forming disc galaxy with the EAGLE galaxy formation model. Then, we re-simulate the galaxy with controlled changes to its initial conditions, using the genetic modification technique. These modifications either increase or decrease the stellar mass ratio of the galaxy's last significant merger, which occurs at \$z{\textbackslash}approx 0.74\$. The halo reaches the same present-day mass in all cases, but changing the mass ratio of the merger yields markedly different galaxy and CGM properties. We find that a merger can unlock rapid growth of the central supermassive black hole if it disrupts the co-rotational motion of gas in the black hole's vicinity. Conversely, if a less disruptive merger occurs and gas close to the black hole is not disturbed, the AGN does not strongly affect the CGM, and consequently the galaxy continues to form stars. Our result illustrates how a unified view of AGN feedback, the baryon cycle and the interstellar medium is required to understand how mergers and quenching are connected over long timescales.},

	abstract = {The star formation and gas content of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) are depleted relative to more isolated galaxies in the Local Group (LG) at fixed stellar mass. We explore the environmental regulation of gas content and quenching of star formation in \$z=0\$ galaxies at \$M\_\{*\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{5-10\}\$ \${\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ around 14 MW-mass hosts from the FIRE-2 simulations. Lower-mass satellites (\$M\_\{*\}{\textbackslash}lesssim10{\textasciicircum}7\$ \${\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) are mostly quiescent and higher-mass satellites (\$M\_\{*\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim10{\textasciicircum}8\$ \${\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) are mostly star-forming, with intermediate-mass satellites (\$M\_\{*\}{\textbackslash}approx10{\textasciicircum}\{7-8\}\$ \${\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) split roughly equally between quiescent and star-forming. Hosts with more gas in their circumgalactic medium have a higher quiescent fraction of massive satellites (\$M\_\{*\}=10{\textasciicircum}\{8-9\}\$ \${\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$). We find no significant dependence on isolated versus paired (LG-like) host environments, and the quiescent fractions of satellites around MW-mass and LMC-mass hosts from the FIRE-2 simulations are remarkably similar. Environmental effects that lead to quenching can also occur as preprocessing in low-mass groups prior to MW infall. Lower-mass satellites typically quenched before MW infall as central galaxies or rapidly during infall into a low-mass group or a MW-mass galaxy. Intermediate- to high-mass satellites usually require \${\textbackslash}geq1-2\$ pericentre passages (\${\textbackslash}approx2.5-5\$ Gyr) within a MW-mass halo to quench. Most galaxies with \$M\_\{*\}{\textbackslash}gtrsim10{\textasciicircum}\{6.5\}\$ \${\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ did not quench before falling into a host, indicating a possible upper mass limit for isolated quenching. The simulations are broadly consistent with the quiescent fractions of satellites observed in the LG and the SAGA survey, because the simulation average lies between them and the host-to-host scatter is large.},

	abstract = {We study the population of galactic disks expected in current hierarchical clustering models for structure formation. A rotationally supported disk with exponential surface density profile is assumed to form with a mass and angular momentum which are fixed fractions of those of its surrounding dark halo. We assume that haloes respond adiabatically to disk formation, and that only stable disks can correspond to real systems. With these assumptions the predicted population can match both present-day disks and the damped Lyman alpha absorbers in QSO spectra. Good agreement is found provided: (i) the masses of disks are a few percent of those of their haloes; (ii) the specific angular momenta of disks are similar to those of their haloes; (iii) present-day disks were assembled recently (at z{\textless}1). In particular, the observed scatter in the size-rotation velocity plane is reproduced, as is the slope and scatter of the Tully-Fisher relation. The zero-point of the TF relation is matched for a stellar mass-to-light ratio of 1 to 2 h in the I-band, consistent with observational values derived from disk dynamics. High redshift disks are predicted to be small and dense, and could plausibly merge together to form the observed population of elliptical galaxies. In many (but not all) currently popular cosmogonies, disks with rotation velocities exceeding 200 km/s can account for a third or more of the observed damped Lyman alpha systems at z=2.5. Half of the lines-of-sight to such systems are predicted to intersect the absorber at r{\textgreater}3kpc/h and about 10\% at r{\textgreater}10kpc/h. The cross-section for absorption is strongly weighted towards disks with large angular momentum and so large size for their mass. The galaxy population associated with damped absorbers should thus be biased towards low surface brightness systems.},

In this study, we analyse the structure of stellar haloes, specifically the mass density, surface brightness, metallicity, colour and age radial profiles, finding generally very good agreement with recent observations of local galaxies. The stellar density profiles are well fitted by broken power laws, with inner slopes of {\textasciitilde} -3, outer slopes of {\textasciitilde} -4 and break radii that are typically {\textasciitilde} 20-40 kpc. The break radii generally mark the transition between in situ formation and accretion-driven formation of the halo. The metallicity, colour and age profiles show mild large-scale gradients, particularly when spherically-averaged or viewed along the major axes. Along the minor axes, however, the profiles are nearly flat, in agreement with observations. Overall, the structural properties can be understood by two factors: that in situ stars dominate the inner regions and that they reside in a spatially-flattened distribution that is aligned with the disc. Observations targeting both the major and minor axes of galaxies are thus required to obtain a complete picture of stellar haloes.},

We find that the `two-phase' picture of galaxy formation predicted by some models is a good approximation only for the most massive galaxies in our simulation -- namely, the stellar mass growth of galaxies below a few times \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$ is dominated by in situ star formation at all redshifts. The fraction of the total stellar mass of galaxies at \$z=0\$ contributed by accreted stars shows a strong dependence on galaxy stellar mass, ranging from about 10 per cent for Milky Way-sized galaxies to over 80 per cent for \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$ objects, yet with a large galaxy-to-galaxy variation. At a fixed stellar mass, elliptical galaxies and those formed at the centres of younger haloes exhibit larger fractions of ex situ stars than disc-like galaxies and those formed in older haloes. On average, \${\textbackslash}sim\$50 per cent of the ex situ stellar mass comes from major mergers (stellar mass ratio \${\textbackslash}mu {\textgreater} 1/4\$), \${\textbackslash}sim\$20 per cent from minor mergers (\$1/10 {\textless} {\textbackslash}mu {\textless} 1/4\$), \${\textbackslash}sim\$20 per cent from very minor mergers (\${\textbackslash}mu {\textless} 1/10\$), and \${\textbackslash}sim\$10 per cent from stars that were stripped from surviving galaxies (e.g. flybys or ongoing mergers).

	abstract = {The density profiles of dark matter haloes can potentially probe dynamics, fundamental physics, and cosmology, but some of the most promising signals reside near or beyond the virial radius. While these scales have recently become observable, the profiles at large radii are still poorly understood theoretically, chiefly because the distribution of orbiting matter (the one-halo term) is partially concealed by particles falling into halos for the first time. We present an algorithm to dynamically disentangle the orbiting and infalling contributions by counting the pericentric passages of billions of simulation particles. We analyse dynamically split profiles out to 10 R200m across a wide range of halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. We show that the orbiting term experiences a sharp truncation at the edge of the orbit distribution. Its sharpness and position are mostly determined by the mass accretion rate, confirming that the entire profile shape primarily depends on halo dynamics and secondarily on mass, redshift, and cosmology. The infalling term also depends on the accretion rate for fast-accreting haloes but is mostly set by the environment for slowly accreting haloes, leading to a diverse array of shapes that does not conform to simple theoretical models. While the resulting scatter in the infalling term reaches 1 dex, the scatter in the orbiting term is only between 0.1 and 0.4 dex and almost independent of radius. We demonstrate a tight correspondence between the redshift evolution in LCDM and the slope of the matter power spectrum.},

To this end, we construct a sample of unprecedented size, exploiting multi-wavelength \$u\$-to-\$K\_s\$ photometry from the deep wide area surveys KiDS+VIKING paired with high-quality \$i\$-band imaging from HSC-SSP. Dependencies of the shapes on mass, redshift, photometric bulge prominence and environment are considered. For comparison, the intrinsic shapes of quenched galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations are analyzed and contrasted to their formation history. We find that over the full \$0{\textless}z{\textless}0.9\$ range, and in both simulations and observations, spheroidal 3D shapes become more abundant at \$M\_* {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, with the effect being most pronounced at lower redshifts. In TNG, the most massive galaxies feature the highest ex-situ stellar mass fractions, pointing to violent relaxation via mergers as the mechanism responsible for their 3D shape transformation. Larger differences between observed and simulated shapes are found at low to intermediate masses. At any mass, the most spheroidal quiescent galaxies in TNG feature the highest bulge mass fractions, and conversely observed quiescent galaxies with the highest bulge-to-total ratios are found to be intrinsically the roundest. Finally, we detect an environmental influence on galaxy shape, at least at the highest masses, such that at fixed mass and redshift quiescent galaxies tend to be rounder in denser environments.},

	abstract = {We explore how diffuse stellar light and globular clusters (GCs) can be used to trace the matter distribution of their host halo using an observational methodology. For this, we use 117 simulated dark matter (DM) haloes from the \$(34.4{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm cMpc){\textasciicircum}3\$ periodic volume of the E-MOSAICS project. For each halo, we compare the stellar surface brightness and GC projected number density maps to the surface densities of DM and total mass. We find that the dominant structures identified in the stellar light and in the GCs correspond closely with those from the DM and total mass. Our method is unaffected by the presence of satellites and its precision improves with fainter GC samples. We recover tight relations between the profiles of stellar surface brightness and GC number density to those of the DM, suggesting that the profile of DM can be accurately recovered from the stars and GCs (\${\textbackslash}sigma{\textbackslash}leq0.5{\textasciitilde}\$dex). We quantify the projected morphology of DM, stars and GCs, and find that the stars and GCs are more flattened than the DM. Additionally, the semi-major axes of the distribution of stars and GCs are typically misaligned by \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciitilde}\$degrees from that of DM. We demonstrate that deep imaging of diffuse stellar light and GCs can place constraints on the shape, profile and orientation of their host halo. These results extend down to haloes with central galaxies \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textbackslash}geq10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, and the analysis will be applicable to future data from the Euclid, Roman and the Rubin observatories.},

The modelling includes a subgrid prescription for dusty star-forming regions, with both the subgrid obscuration of these regions and the fraction of metals in diffuse interstellar dust calibrated against far-infrared fluxes of local galaxies. The predicted optical colours as a function of stellar mass agree well with observation, with the SKIRT model showing marked improvement over a simple dust screen model. The orientation dependence of attenuation is weaker than observed because EAGLE galaxies are generally puffier than real galaxies, due to the pressure floor imposed on the interstellar medium. The mock H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity function agrees reasonably well with the data, and we quantify the extent to which dust obscuration affects observed H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ fluxes. The distribution of D4000 break values is bimodal, as observed. In the simulation, 20\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of galaxies deemed `passive' for the SKIRT model, i.e. exhibiting D4000 \${\textgreater} 1.8\$, are classified `active' when ISM dust attenuation is not included. The fraction of galaxies with stellar mass greater than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ that are deemed passive is slightly smaller than observed, which is due to low levels of residual star formation in these simulated galaxies.

In order to separate the progenitor population from the background stars, we investigate its chemical properties with up to 30 element abundances from the GALAH+ Survey Data Release 3 (DR3). To inform our choice of elements for purely chemically selecting accreted stars, we analyse 4164 stars with low-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ abundances and halo kinematics. These are most different to the Milky Way stars for abundances of Mg, Si, Na, Al, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Cu. Based on the significance of abundance differences and detection rates, we apply Gaussian mixture models to various element abundance combinations. We find the most populated and least contaminated component, which we confirm to represent GSE, contains 1049 stars selected via [Na/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] in GALAH+ DR3. We provide tables of our selections and report the chrono-chemodynamical properties (age, chemistry, and dynamics). Through a previously reported clean dynamical selection of GSE stars, including \$30 {\textless} {\textbackslash}sqrt\{J\_R{\textasciitilde}/{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc{\textbackslash},km{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\} {\textless} 55\$, we can characterise an unprecedented 24 abundances of this structure with GALAH+ DR3.

	abstract = {If the favored hierarchical cosmological model is correct, then the Milky Way system should have accreted {\textasciitilde}100-200 luminous satellite galaxies in the past {\textbackslash}{\textasciitilde}12 Gyr. We model this process using a hybrid semi-analytic plus N-body approach which distinguishes explicitly between the evolution of light and dark matter in accreted satellites. This distinction is essential to our ability to produce a realistic stellar halo, with mass and density profile much like that of our own Galaxy, and a surviving satellite population that matches the observed number counts and structural parameter distributions of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Our model stellar halos have density profiles which typically drop off with radius faster than those of the dark matter. They are assembled from the inside out, with the majority of mass ({\textasciitilde}80\%) coming from the {\textbackslash}{\textasciitilde}15 most massive accretion events. The satellites that contribute to the stellar halo have median accretion times of {\textasciitilde}9 Gyr in the past, while surviving satellite systems have median accretion times of {\textasciitilde}5 Gyr in the past. This implies that stars associated with the inner halo should be quite different chemically from stars in surviving satellites and also from stars in the outer halo or those liberated in recent disruption events. We briefly discuss the expected spatial structure and phase space structure for halos formed in this manner. Searches for this type of structure offer a direct test of whether cosmology is indeed hierarchical on small scales.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the global and fine structure of four middle-mass disc galaxies obtained from simulations in a \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM scenario. These objects have photometric D/T ratios in good agreement with those observed for late-type spirals, as well as kinematic properties in agreement with the observational Tully-Fisher relation. We identify the different dynamical components at z=0 on the basis of both orbital parameters and the binding energy of stars in the galaxy. In this way, we recognize a slowly rotating centrally concentrated spheroid, and two disc components supported by rotation: a thin disc with stars in nearly circular orbits, and a thick disc with orbital parameters transitional between the thin disc and the spheroid. The spheroidal component is composed mainly by old, metal-poor and \{{\textbackslash}alpha\}-enhanced stars. The distribution of metals in this component shows, however, a clear bimodality with a low-metallicity peak, which could be related to a classical bulge, and a high-metallicity peak, which could be related to a pseudo-bulge. The thin disc appears in our simulations as the youngest and most metal-rich component. The radial distribution of ages and colours in this component are U-shaped: the new stars are forming in the inner regions, and then migrate through secular processes. Finally, we also find a thick disc containing about 16\% of the total stellar mass and with properties that are intermediate between those of the thin disc and the spheroid. Its low-metallicity stars are \{{\textbackslash}alpha\}-enhanced when compared to thin disc stars of the same metallicity. The structural parameters (e.g., the scale height) of the simulated thick discs suggest that such a component could result from the combination of different thickening mechanisms that include merger-driven processes, but also long-lived internal perturbations of the thin disc.

The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

While it is known that they can form in isolation, or be induced tidally, few studies have explored the production of stellar bars in galaxy merging. We look to investigate bar formation in galaxy merging using methods from deep learning to analyse our N-body simulations. The primary aim is to determine the constraints on the mass ratio and orientations of merging galaxies that are most conducive to bar formation. We further aim to explore whether it is possible to classify simulated barred spiral galaxies based on the mechanism of their formation. We test the feasibility of this new classification schema with simulated galaxies. Using a set of 29,400 images obtained from our simulations, we first trained a convolutional neural network to distinguish between barred and non-barred galaxies. We then tested the network on simulations with different mass ratios and spin angles. We adapted the core neural network architecture for use with our additional aims. We find that a strong inverse relationship between mass ratio and the number of bars produced. We also identify two distinct phases in the bar formation process; (1) the initial, tidally induced formation pre-merger, and (2) the destruction and/or regeneration of the during and after the merger. Mergers with low mass ratios and closely-aligned orientations are considerably more conducive to bar formation compared to equal-mass mergers. We demonstrate the flexibility of our deep learning approach by showing it is feasible to classify bars based on their formation mechanism.},

Walker and Penarrubia have used this approach to argue that data for these galaxies are consistent with constant-density `cores' in their inner regions and rule out `cuspy' Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles with high statistical significance, particularly in the case of Sculptor. We test the validity of these claims using dwarf galaxies in the APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment) Lambda cold dark matter cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of analogues of the Local Group. These galaxies all have NFW dark matter density profiles and a subset of them develop two distinct metallicity subpopulations reminiscent of Sculptor and Fornax. We apply a method analogous to that of Walker and Penarrubia to a sample of 53 simulated dwarfs and find that this procedure often leads to a statistically significant detection of a core in the profile when in reality there is a cusp. Although multiple factors contribute to these failures, the main cause is a violation of the assumption of spherical symmetry upon which the mass estimators are based. The stellar populations of the simulated dwarfs tend to be significantly elongated and, in several cases, the two metallicity populations have different asphericity and are misaligned. As a result, a wide range of slopes of the density profile are inferred depending on the angle from which the galaxy is viewed.},

The method can be applied to multi-mass particle distributions making it suitable for creating resimulation, or `zoom' initial conditions. By testing against an analytic solution we show that the method works well for a spherically symmetric perturbation with radial features ranging over more than three orders of magnitude in linear scale and eleven orders of magnitude in particle mass. We apply the method and repeat resimulations of the rapid formation of a high mass halo at redshift fifty and the formation of a Milky-Way mass dark matter halo at redshift zero. In both cases we find that many properties of the final halo show a much smaller sensitivity to the start redshift with the 2lpt initial conditions, than simulations started from Zel'dovich initial conditions. For spherical overdense regions structure formation is erroneously delayed in simulations starting from Zel'dovich initial conditions, and we demonstrate for the case of the formation the high redshift halo that this delay can be accounted for using the spherical collapse model. In addition to being more accurate, 2lpt initial conditions allow simulations to start later, saving computer time.},

Tiny subregions of such a field can be used to set the phase information for Gaussian initial conditions for individual cosmological simulations of structure formation. This approach has several attractive features: (i) the hierarchical structure based on an octree is particular well suited for generating follow up resimulation or zoom initial conditions; (ii) the phases are defined for all relevant physical scales in advance so that resimulation initial conditions are, by construction, consistent both with their parent simulation and with each other; (iii) the field can easily be made public by releasing a code to compute it - once public, phase information can be shared or published by specifying a spatial location within the realisation. In this paper we describe the principles behind creating such realisations. We define an example called PANPHASIA and in a companion paper on arXiv (Jenkins \& Booth), make public a code to compute it. With fifty octree levels Panphasia spans a factor of more than 10{\textasciicircum}15 in linear scale - a range that significantly exceeds the ratio of the current Hubble radius to the putative CDM free-streaming scale. We show how to modify a code used for making cosmological and resimulation initial conditions so that it can take the phase information from Panphasia and, using this code, we demonstrate that it is possible to make good quality resimulation initial conditions. We define a convention for publishing phase information from Panphasia and publish the initial phases for several of the Virgo Consortium's most recent cosmological simulations including the 303 billion particle MXXL simulation.},

The Planck spectra at high multipoles are extremely well described by the standard spatially-flat six-parameter LCDM cosmology. In this model Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble constant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density parameter, Omega\_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to percent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an analysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95\% upper limit of r{\textless}0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles. Using BAO and CMB data, we find N\_eff=3.30+/-0.27 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the summed neutrino mass. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of N\_eff=3.046. We find no evidence for dynamical dark energy. Despite the success of the standard LCDM model, this cosmology does not provide a good fit to the CMB power spectrum at low multipoles, as noted previously by the WMAP team.

We compare simulations that use the same subgrid models without re-calibration of the parameters but employing the standard GADGET flavour of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) instead of the more recent state-of-the-art ANARCHY formulation of SPH that was used in the fiducial EAGLE runs. We find that the properties of most galaxies, including their masses and sizes, are not significantly affected by the details of the hydrodynamics solver. However, the star formation rates of the most massive objects are affected by the lack of phase mixing due to spurious surface tension in the simulation using standard SPH. This affects the efficiency with which AGN activity can quench star formation in these galaxies and it also leads to differences in the intragroup medium that affect the X-ray emission from these objects. The differences that can be attributed to the hydrodynamics solver are, however, likely to be less important at lower resolution. We also find that the use of a time step limiter is important for achieving the feedback efficiency required to match observations of the low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function.},

Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2 × 107 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology–radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

	abstract = {The abundance and structure of dark matter subhalos has been analyzed extensively in recent studies of dark matter-only simulations, but comparatively little is known about the impact of baryonic physics on halo substructures. We here extend the SUBFIND algorithm for substructure identification such that it can be reliably applied to dissipative hydrodynamical simulations that include star formation. This allows, in particular, the identification of galaxies as substructures in simulations of clusters of galaxies, and a determination of their content of gravitationally bound stars, dark matter, and hot and cold gas. Using a large set of cosmological cluster simulations, we present a detailed analysis of halo substructures in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, focusing in particular on the influence both of radiative and non-radiative gas physics, and of non-standard physics such as thermal conduction and feedback by galactic outflows. We also examine the impact of numerical nuisance parameters such as artificial viscosity parameterizations. We find that diffuse hot gas is efficiently stripped from subhalos when they enter the highly pressurized cluster atmosphere. This has the effect of decreasing the subhalo mass function relative to a corresponding dark matter-only simulation. These effects are mitigated in radiative runs, where baryons condense in the central subhalo regions and form compact stellar cores. However, in all cases, only a very small fraction, of the order of one percent, of subhalos within the cluster virial radii preserve a gravitationally bound hot gaseous atmosphere. (abridged)},

To perform this kind of analysis, is necessary to define some criteria to separate those components. Decomposition methods based on dynamical properties are more physically motivated than photometry-based ones. We use the unsupervised Gaussian Mixture model of {\textbackslash}texttt\{galactic structure finder\} to extract the components of a sub-sample of galaxies with Milky Way-like masses from the EAGLE simulations. A clustering in the space of first and second order dynamical moments of all identified substructures reveals five types of galaxy components: thin and thick disks, stellar halos, bulges and spheroids. We analyse the dynamical, morphological and stellar population properties of these five component types, exploring to what extent these properties correlate with each other, and how much they depend on the total galaxy stellar and dark matter halo masses. All galaxies contain a bulge, a stellar halo and a disk. 60\% of objects host two disks (thin and thick), and 68\% host also a spheroid. The dynamical disk-to-total ratio does not depend on stellar mass, but the median rotational velocities of the two disks do. Thin disks are well separated in stellar ages, [Fe/H] and \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-enhancement from the three dispersion-dominated components, while thick disks are in between. Except for thin disks, all components show correlations among their stellar population properties: older ages mean lower metallicities and larger \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-enhancement. Finally, we quantify the weak dependence of stellar population properties on each component's dynamics.},

The dark matter halo, on the other hand, is made up primarily of small unresolved subhaloes (\${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}6\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) and a ``smooth'' component consisting of particles which were never bound to a subhalo. Despite these differences, the massive dwarfs that make up the majority of the stellar halo also contribute a significant fraction of the dark matter. The stars and dark matter stripped from these dwarfs are related through their kinematics and this leaves imprints in the phase-space structure of the haloes. We examine the relation between the location of features, such as caustics, in the phase space of the stars and dark halo properties. We show that the ``edge'' of the stellar halo is a probe of dark matter halo mass and assembly history. The edges of Milky Way-mass galaxies should be visible at a surface brightness of 31-36 mag arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$.},

A kinematical method is used to select the thin- and thick-disk stars for comparison. We calculate the scale length and scale height of the kinematically and chemically selected thick and thin disks based on the axisymmetric Jeans equation. We conclude that the scale length of the thick disk is approximately equal to that of the thin disk via a kinematical approach. For the chemical selection, this disparity is about 1 kpc. Finally, we get the stellar orbital parameters and try to unveil the formation scenario of the thick disk.

Speciﬁcally, we model the dynamics of 16,269 G-type dwarfs from SEGUE, which sample 5 kpc {\textless} RGC {\textless} 12 kpc and 0.3 kpc {\textbar}Z{\textbar} 3 kpc. We independently ﬁt a parameterized MW potential and a three-integral, action-based distribution function (DF) to the phase-space data of 43 separate abundanceselected sub-populations (MAPs), accounting for the complex selection effects affecting the data. We robustly measure the total surface density within 1.1 kpc of the mid-plane to 5\% over 4.5 kpc {\textless} RGC {\textless} 9 kpc. Using metal-poor MAPs with small radial scale lengths as dynamical tracers probes 4.5 kpc RGC 7 kpc, while MAPs with longer radial scale lengths sample 7 kpc RGC 9 kpc. We measure the mass-weighted Galactic disk scale length to be Rd = 2.15 ± 0.14 kpc, in agreement with the photometrically inferred spatial distribution of stellar mass. We thereby measure dynamically the mass of the Galactic stellar disk to unprecedented accuracy: M∗ = 4.6 ± 0.3 + 3.0 (R0/ kpc − 8) × 1010 M and a total local surface density of ΣR0 (Z = 1.1 kpc) = 68 ± 4 M pc−2 of which 38 ± 4 M pc−2 is contributed by stars and stellar remnants. By combining our surface density measurements with the terminal velocity curve, we ﬁnd that the MW’s disk is maximal in the sense that Vc,disk/Vc,total = 0.83 ± 0.04 at R = 2.2 Rd . We also constrain for the ﬁrst time the radial proﬁle of the dark halo at such small Galactocentric radii, ﬁnding that ρDM(r; ≈ R0) ∝ 1/rα with α {\textless} 1.53 at 95\% conﬁdence.

This work uses a suite of idealised, collisionless N-body simulations of minor mergers and a particle tagging technique to understand how these different ingredients shape each contribution to the accreted halo, in both density and kinematics. I find that more massive satellites deposit their stars deeper into the gravitational potential of the host, with a clear segregation enforced by dynamical friction. Earlier accretion events contribute more to the inner regions of the halo; more concentrated subhaloes sink deeper through increased dynamical friction. The orbital circularity of the progenitor at infall is only important for low-mass satellites: dynamical friction efficiently radialises the most massive minor mergers erasing the imprint of the infall orbit for satellite-to-host virial mass ratios \${\textbackslash}gtrsim1/20\$. The kinematics of the stars contributed by each satellite is also ordered with satellite mass: low-mass satellites contribute fast-moving populations, in both ordered rotation and radial velocity dispersion. In turn, contributions by massive satellites have lower velocity dispersion and lose their angular momentum to dynamical friction, resulting in a strong radial anisotropy.},

We calculate the X-ray properties in a manner consistent with observational techniques, demonstrating the bias and scatter introduced by using estimated masses. We find the total stellar content and black hole masses of the clusters to be in good agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters are too gas rich, suggesting that the AGN feedback model is not efficient enough at expelling gas from the high-redshift progenitors of the clusters. The X-ray properties, such as the spectroscopic temperature and the soft-band luminosity, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich properties are in reasonable agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters have too high central temperatures and larger-than-observed entropy cores, which is likely driven by the AGN feedback after the cluster core has formed. The total metal content and its distribution throughout the ICM are a good match to the observations.},

	abstract = {It is generally assumed that galaxies are a bimodal population in both star formation and structure: star-forming galaxies are disks, while passive galaxies host large bulges or are entirely spheroidal. Here, we test this scenario by presenting a full census of the kinematic morphologies of a volume-limited sample of galaxies in the local Universe extracted from the MaNGA galaxy survey. We measure the integrated stellar line-of-sight velocity to velocity dispersion ratio (\$V/{\textbackslash}sigma\$) for 4574 galaxies in the stellar mass range \$9.75 {\textless} {\textbackslash}log M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}[{\textbackslash}rm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}] {\textless} 11.75\$. We show that at fixed stellar mass, the distribution of \$V/{\textbackslash}sigma\$ is not bimodal, and that a simple separation between fast and slow rotators is over-simplistic. Fast rotators are a mixture of at least two populations, referred to here as dynamically-cold disks and intermediate systems, with disks dominating in both total stellar mass and number. When considering star-forming and passive galaxies separately, the star-forming population is almost entirely made up of disks, while the passive population is mixed, implying an array of quenching mechanisms. Passive disks represent \${\textbackslash}sim\$30\% (both in number and mass) of passive galaxies, nearly a factor of two higher than that of slow rotators, reiterating that these are an important population for understanding galaxy quenching. These results paint a picture of a local Universe dominated by disky galaxies, most of which become somewhat less rotation-supported upon or after quenching. While spheroids are present to a degree, they are certainly not the evolutionary end-point for the majority of galaxies.},

	abstract = {Large galaxy samples from multi-object IFS surveys now allow for a statistical analysis of the z{\textasciitilde}0 galaxy population using resolved kinematics. However, the improvement in number statistics comes at a cost, with multi-object IFS survey more severely impacted by the effect of seeing and lower S/N. We present an analysis of {\textasciitilde}1800 galaxies from the SAMI Galaxy Survey and investigate the spread and overlap in the kinematic distributions of the spin parameter proxy \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{Re\}\$ as a function of stellar mass and ellipticity. For SAMI data, the distributions of galaxies identified as regular and non-regular rotators with {\textbackslash}textsc\{kinemetry\} show considerable overlap in the \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{Re\}\$-\${\textbackslash}varepsilon\_e\$ diagram. In contrast, visually classified galaxies (obvious and non-obvious rotators) are better separated in \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{Re\}\$ space, with less overlap of both distributions. Then, we use a Bayesian mixture model to analyse the observed \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{Re\}\$-\${\textbackslash}log(M\_*/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\})\$ distribution. Below \${\textbackslash}log(M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}){\textbackslash}sim10.5\$, a single beta distribution is sufficient to fit the complete \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{Re\}\$ distribution, whereas a second beta distribution is required above \${\textbackslash}log(M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}){\textbackslash}sim10.5\$ to account for a population of low-\${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{Re\}\$ galaxies. While the Bayesian mixture model presents the cleanest separation of the two kinematic populations, we find the unique information provided by visual classification of kinematic maps should not be disregarded in future studies. Applied to mock-observations from different cosmological simulations, the mixture model also predicts bimodal \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{Re\}\$ distributions, albeit with different positions of the \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{Re\}\$ peaks. Our analysis validates the conclusions from previous smaller IFS surveys, but also demonstrates the importance of using kinematic selection criteria that are dictated by the quality of the observed or simulated data.},

We analyse the surface brightness profiles of the 19 bright ETGs inside the virial radius of the Fornax cluster. The main aim of this work is to identify signatures of accretion onto galaxies by studying the presence of outer stellar halos, and understand their nature and occurrence. Our analysis also provides a new and accurate estimate of the intra-cluster light inside the virial radius of Fornax. We performed multi-component fits to the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles available for all sample galaxies. This allows to quantify the relative weight of all components in the galaxy structure that contribute to the total light. In addition, we derived the average g-i colours in each component identified by the fit, as well as the azimuthally averaged g-i colour profiles, to correlate them with the stellar mass of each galaxy and the location inside the cluster. We find that in the most massive and reddest ETGs the fraction of light in, probably accreted, halos is much larger than in the other galaxies. Less-massive galaxies have an accreted mass fraction lower than 30\%, bluer colours and reside in the low-density regions of the cluster. Inside the virial radius of the cluster, the total luminosity of the intra-cluster light, compared with the total luminosity of all cluster members, is about 34\%. Inside the Fornax cluster there is a clear correlation between the amount of accreted material in the stellar halos of galaxies and the density of the environment in which those galaxies reside. By comparing this quantity with theoretical predictions and previous observational estimates, there is a clear indication that the driving factor for the accretion process is the total stellar mass of the galaxy, in agreement with the hierarchical accretion scenario.},

We investigate how kinematically defined disc and spheroidal structures form and evolve in the EAGLE hydrodynamic simulation of galaxy formation. At high redshift most galaxies of all masses are asymmetric. By redshift \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 1.5\$ the Hubble sequence is established and after this time most of the stellar mass is in spheroids whose contribution to the stellar mass budget continues to rise to the present day. The stellar mass fraction in discs peaks at \$z{\textbackslash}simeq 0.5\$ but overall remains subdominant at all times although discs contribute most of the stellar mass in systems of mass \$M{\textasciicircum}*{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$z {\textbackslash}leq 1.5\$. Star formation occurs predominantly in disc structures throughout most of cosmic time but morphological transformations rearrange stars, thus establishing the low-redshift morphological mix. Morphological transformations are common and we quantify the rates at which they occur. The rate of growth of spheroids decreases at \$z {\textless} 2\$ while the rate of decay of discs remains roughly constant at \$z {\textless} 1\$.

	abstract = {We investigate the origin of the Hubble sequence by analysing the evolution of the kinematic morphologies of central galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological simulation. By separating each galaxy into disk and spheroidal stellar components and tracing their evolution along the merger tree, we find that the morphology of galaxies follows a common evolutionary trend. We distinguish three phases of galaxy formation. These phases are determined primarily by mass, rather than redshift. For M\_star {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\} M\_sun galaxies grow in a disorganised way, resulting in a morphology that is dominated by random stellar motions. This phase is dominated by in-situ star formation, partly triggered by mergers. In the mass range 10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\} M\_sun {\textless} M\_star {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\} M\_sun galaxies evolve towards a disk-dominated morphology, driven by in-situ star formation. The central spheroid (i.e. the bulge) at z = 0 consists mostly of stars that formed in-situ, yet the formation of the bulge is to a large degree associated with mergers. Finally, at M\_star {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\} M\_sun growth through in-situ star formation slows down considerably and galaxies transform towards a more spheroidal morphology. This transformation is driven more by the buildup of spheroids than by the destruction of disks. Spheroid formation in these galaxies happens mostly by accretion at large radii of stars formed ex-situ (i.e. the halo rather than the bulge).},

	abstract = {We investigate the dependence of the local galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) on galaxy morphology. We use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 with morphological classifications from Galaxy Zoo, and compare with the EAGLE cosmological simulation. At fixed halo mass in the mass range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.7\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{12.9\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, the median stellar masses of SDSS disc galaxies are up to a factor of 1.4 higher than the median masses of their elliptical counterparts. However, when we switch from the stellar masses from Kauffmann et al. to those calculated by Chang et al. or Brinchmann et al., the median SHMR from discs and ellipticals coincide in this mass range. For halo masses larger than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, discs are less massive than ellipticals in same-mass haloes, regardless of whose stellar mass estimates we use. However, we find that for these high halo masses the results for discs may be affected by central/satellite misclassifications. The EAGLE simulation predicts that discs are up to a factor of 1.5 more massive than elliptical galaxies residing in same-mass haloes less massive than \$10{\textasciicircum}\{13\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, in agreement with the Kauffmann et al. data. Haloes with masses between \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\}\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, that host disc galaxies, were assembled earlier than those hosting ellipticals. This suggests that the discs are more massive because they had more time for gas accretion and star formation. In \$10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{12.5\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ haloes, the central black holes in elliptical galaxies grew faster and became more massive than their counterparts in disc galaxies. This suggests that in this halo mass range the ellipticals are less massive because AGN feedback ejected more of the halo's gas reservoir, reducing star formation, and suppressing the (re)growth of stellar discs.},

	abstract = {Massive disk galaxies like our Milky Way should host an ancient, metal-poor, and centrally concentrated stellar population. This population reflects the star formation and enrichment in the few most massive progenitor components that coalesced at high redshift to form the proto-Galaxy. While metal-poor stars are known to reside in the inner few kiloparsecs of our Galaxy, current data do not yet provide a comprehensive picture of such a metal-poor "heart" of the Milky Way. We use information from Gaia DR3, especially the XP spectra, to construct a sample of 2 million bright (BP \${\textless}15.5\$ mag) giant stars within \$30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ of the Galactic Center with robust [M/H] estimates, \${\textbackslash}delta\$ [M/H] \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.1\$. For most sample members we can calculate orbits based on Gaia RVS velocities and astrometry. This sample reveals an extensive, ancient, and metal-poor population that includes \${\textbackslash}sim 18,000\$ stars with \$-2.7{\textless}\$ [M/H] \${\textless}-1.5\$, representing a stellar mass of \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}7\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. The spatial distribution of these [M/H] \${\textless}-1.5\$ stars has a Gaussian extent of only \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\_\{GC\}\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 2.7\$ kpc around the Galactic center, with most of these orbits being confined to the inner Galaxy. At high orbital eccentricities, there is clear evidence for accreted halo stars in their pericentral orbit phase. Stars with [M/H] \${\textless} -2\$ show no net rotation, whereas those with [M/H] \${\textbackslash}sim -1\$ are rotation dominated. Most of the tightly bound stars show \$[{\textbackslash}alpha/{\textbackslash}text\{Fe\}]\$-enhancement and [Al/Fe]-[Mn/Fe] abundance patterns expected for an origin in the more massive portions of the proto-Galaxy. These central, metal-poor stars most likely predate the oldest part of the disk (\${\textbackslash}tau\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{age\}\}{\textbackslash}approx 12.5\$ Gyrs), which implies that they formed at \$z{\textbackslash}gtrsim 5\$, forging the proto-Milky Way.},

	abstract = {Methods. We built a set of mock data of two large-scale counter-rotating stellar disks as if they were observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We accounted for diﬀerent photometric, kinematic, and stellar population properties of the two counter-rotating components as a function of galaxy inclination. We extracted the stellar kinematics in the wavelength region of the calcium triplet absorption lines by adopting a Gauss-Hermite (GH) parameterization of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD).
Results. We conﬁrm that the strongest signature of the presence of two counter-rotating stellar disks is the symmetric double peak in the velocity dispersion map, already known as the 2σ feature. The size, shape, and slope of the 2σ peak strongly depend on the velocity separation and relative light contribution of the two counter-rotating stellar disks. When the 2σ peak is diﬃcult to detect due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the data, the large-scale structure in the h3 map can be used as a diagnostic for strong and weak counter-rotation. The counter-rotating kinematic signatures become fainter at lower viewing angles as an eﬀect of the smaller projected velocity separation between the two counter-rotating components. We conﬁrm that the observed frequency of 2σ galaxies represents only a lower limit of the stellar counter-rotation phenomenon.
Conclusions. The parameterization with a single GH function does not provide a good description of the LOSVD in the presence of strong counter-rotation. However, using GH parametric solutions is a practical way to reveal the large-scale counter-rotating stellar disks and could be used to detect faint counter-rotating components to improve the statistics of stellar counter-rotation.},

	abstract = {A key feature of a large population of low-mass, late-type disk galaxies are star-forming disks with exponential light distributions. They are typically also associated with thin and flat morphologies, blue colors, and dynamically cold stars moving along circular orbits within co-planar thin gas disks. However, the latter features do not necessarily always imply the former, in fact, a variety of different kinematic configurations do exist. In this work, we use the cosmological hydrodynamical IllustrisTNG Simulation to study the nature and origin of dynamically hot, sometimes even counter-rotating, star-forming disk galaxies in the lower stellar mass range (between \$5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}9{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$ and \$2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$). We find that being dynamically hot arises in most cases as an induced transient state, for example due to galaxy interactions and merger activities, rather than as an age-dependent evolutionary phase of star-forming disk galaxies. The dynamically hot but still actively star-forming disks show a common feature of hosting kinematically misaligned gas and stellar disks, and centrally concentrated on-going star formation. The former is often accompanied by disturbed gas morphologies, while the latter is reflected in low gas and stellar spins in comparison to their dynamically cold, normal disk counterparts. Interestingly, observed galaxies from MaNGA with kinematic misalignment between gas and stars show remarkably similar general properties as the IllustrisTNG galaxies, and therefore are plausible real-world counterparts. In turn, this allows us to make predictions for the stellar orbits and gas properties of these misaligned galaxies.},

	abstract = {We explore several ways to dissect Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) and their surrounding Intracluster Light (ICL) using a surface brightness cut, a luminosity cut, excess light above a de Vaucouleurs profile, or a double S{\textbackslash}'ersic decomposition. Assuming that all light above \$M{\textless}-21.85{\textasciitilde}g'{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm\{mag\}\$ is attributable to the ICL, we find an average ICL fraction of \$f{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm MT\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ICL\}=71{\textbackslash}pm22{\textbackslash}\%\$ of all diffuse light centered on the BCG to belong to the ICL. Likewise, if we assume all light fainter than \${\textbackslash}rm\{SB\}{\textgreater}27\$ \$g'\$ mag arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ to belong to the ICL, the average ICL fraction is \$f{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm SB27\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ICL\}=34{\textbackslash}pm19{\textbackslash}\%\$. After fitting a de Vaucouleurs profile to the inner parts of the SB profile, we detect excess light at large radii, corresponding to an average ICL fraction of \$f{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm DV\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ICL\}=48{\textbackslash}pm20{\textbackslash}\%\$. Finally, by decomposing the SB profile into two S{\textbackslash}'ersic functions, we find an average ICL fraction of \$f{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm S{\textbackslash}times\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ICL\}=52{\textbackslash}pm21{\textbackslash}\%\$ associated with the outer S{\textbackslash}'ersic component. Our measured ICL and BCG+ICL luminosities agree well with predictions from high-resolution simulations where the outer S{\textbackslash}'ersic component traces the unrelaxed, accreted stellar material. BCG and ICL properties defined in this way are correlated with cluster parameters to study the co-evolution of BCGs, ICL, and their host clusters. We find positive correlations between BCG+ICL brightness and cluster mass, cluster velocity dispersion, cluster radius, and integrated satellite brightness, confirming that BCG/ICL growth is indeed coupled with cluster growth. On average, the ICL is better aligned than the BCG with the host cluster in terms of position angle, ellipticity, and centering. That makes it a potential Dark Matter tracer.},

	abstract = {We use semi-analytic techniques to study the formation and evolution of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We show the extreme hierarchical nature of these objects and discuss the limits of simple ways to capture their evolution. In a model where cooling flows are suppressed at late times by AGN activity, the stars of BCGs are formed very early (50 per cent at z{\textasciitilde}5, 80 per cent at z{\textasciitilde}3) and in many small galaxies. The high star formation rates in these high-z progenitors are fuelled by rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts. We find that model BCGs assemble surprisingly late: half their final mass is typically locked-up in a single galaxy after z{\textasciitilde}0.5. Because most of the galaxies accreted onto BCGs have little gas content and red colours, late mergers do not change the apparent age of BCGs. It is this accumulation of a large number of old stellar populations -- driven mainly by the merging history of the dark matter halo itself -- that yields the observed homogeneity of BCG properties. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the evolution of BCGs to high redshifts, from both observational and theoretical viewpoints. We show that our model BCGs are in qualitative agreement with high-z observations. We discuss the hierarchical link between high-z BCGs and their local counter-parts. We show that high-z BCGs belong to the same population as the massive end of local BCG progenitors, although they are not in general the same galaxies. Similarly, high-z BCGs end-up as massive galaxies in the local Universe, although only a fraction of them are actually BCGs of massive clusters.},

By classifying Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) galaxy groups as residing in voids, sheets, filaments or knots using a tidal tensor method, we find that low-mass haloes that reside in knots are older than haloes of the same mass that reside in voids. This result provides direct support to theories that link strong halo tidal interactions with halo assembly times. The trend with GE is reversed at large halo mass, with haloes in knots being younger than haloes of the same mass in voids. We find a clear signal of halo downsizing – more massive haloes host galaxies that assembled their stars earlier. This overall trend holds independently of GE. We support our analysis with an in-depth exploration of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model, used here to correlate several galaxy properties with three different definitions of halo formation time. We find a complex relationship between halo formation time and galaxy properties, with significant scatter. We confirm that stellar mass to halo mass ratio, specific star formation rate (SFR) and mass-weighed age are reasonable proxies of halo formation time, especially at low halo masses. Instantaneous SFR is a poor indicator at all halo masses. Using the same semi-analytic model, we create mock spectral observations using complex star formation and chemical enrichment histories, which approximately mimic GAMA’s typical signal-to-noise ratio and wavelength range. We use these mocks to assert how well potential proxies of halo formation time may be recovered from GAMA-like spectroscopic data.},

We analyse the radial distribution of the accreted stellar mass in {\textasciitilde}500 galaxies from the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Magneticum. Generally, we find good agreement with other simulations in that higher mass galaxies have larger accreted fractions, but we predict higher accretion fractions for low-mass galaxies. Based on the radial distribution of the accreted and in-situ components, we define 6 galaxy classes, from completely accretion dominated to completely in-situ dominated, and measure the transition radii between in-situ and accretion-dominated regions for galaxies that have such a transition. About 70\% of our galaxies have one transition radius. However, we also find about 10\% of the galaxies to be accretion dominated everywhere, and about 13\% to have two transition radii, with the centre and the outskirts both being accretion dominated. We show that these classes are strongly correlated with the galaxy merger histories, especially with the mergers' cold gas fractions. We find high total in-situ (low accretion) fractions to be associated with smaller, lower mass galaxies, lower central dark matter fractions, and larger transition radii. Finally, we show that the dips in observed surface brightness profiles seen in many early-type galaxies do not correspond to the transition from in-situ to accretion-dominated regions, and any inferred mass fractions are not indicative of the true accreted mass. Instead, these dips contain information about the galaxies' dry minor merger assembly history.},

These simulations were performed with an enhanced version of the GADGET code that includes a modified hydrodynamics solver, time-step limiter and subgrid treatments of baryonic physics, such as stellar mass loss, element-by-element radiative cooling, star formation and feedback from star formation and black hole accretion. The simulation suite includes runs performed in volumes ranging from 25 to 100 comoving megaparsecs per side, with numerical resolution chosen to marginally resolve the Jeans mass of the gas at the star formation threshold. The free parameters of the subgrid models for feedback are calibrated to the redshift z=0 galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes and black hole mass - stellar mass relation. The simulations have been shown to match a wide range of observations for present-day and higher-redshift galaxies. The raw particle data have been used to link galaxies across redshifts by creating merger trees. The indexing of the tree produces a simple way to connect a galaxy at one redshift to its progenitors at higher redshift and to identify its descendants at lower redshift. In this paper we present a relational database which we are making available for general use. A large number of properties of haloes and galaxies and their merger trees are stored in the database, including stellar masses, star formation rates, metallicities, photometric measurements and mock gri images. Complex queries can be created to explore the evolution of more than 10{\textasciicircum}5 galaxies, examples of which are provided in appendix. (abridged)},

	abstract = {The stellar halo of the Milky Way records the history of its interactions with dwarf galaxies, whose subsequent destruction results in the formation of an extended stellar component. Recent works have suggested that galaxies with masses comparable to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, \$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}9{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) may be the primary building blocks of the stellar halo of our Galaxy. We use cosmological simulations of the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ Cold Dark Matter model to investigate LMC-mass galaxies at \$z=1-2\$ using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. We find that LMC analogues at \$z=2\$ evolve until the present day along three distinct pathways: (1) those that are destroyed in Milky Way-mass hosts; (2) those that are themselves the main progenitors of Milky Way-mass galaxies; and (3) those that survive until \$z=0\$, with stellar mass \${\textbackslash}sim\$1.0 dex lower than typical Milky Ways. Our model predicts that the properties of these galaxies at \$z=2\$ (stellar metallicities, sizes, gas content etc.) are more or less indistinguishable, irrespective of which of these pathways is eventually taken; a survey targeting such galaxies in this redshift range would struggle to tell apart a 'destroyed' stellar halo progenitor from a 'surviving' LMC analogue. The only factor that determines the eventual fate of these galaxies is their proximity to a neighbouring Milky Way main progenitor at \$z=2\$: while the typical separation to a 'surviving' galaxy is around 7 Mpc, it is only 670 kpc to a 'destroyed' galaxy. Our results suggest that the old stellar populations in the Milky Way may be essentially indistinguishable from the progenitors of its stellar halo.},

	abstract = {Context. The rapidly improving quality and resolution of both low surface brightness observations and cosmological simulations of galaxies enables an increasingly thorough investigation of the imprints of the formation history in the outer, unrelaxed regions of galaxies, and a direct comparison to another tracer of galaxy formation, the internal kinematics. Aims. Using the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical cosmological simulation Magneticum Pathfinder, we identify tidal tails, shells, streams, and satellite planes, and connect their existence to the amount of rotational support and the formation histories of the host galaxies. Methods. Tidal features are visually classified from a three-dimensional rendering of the simulated galaxies by several scientists independently. Only features that were identified by at least half of the participating individuals are considered as existing features. The results are compared to observations of the MATLAS survey. Results. Shells are preferentially found around kinematically slowly rotating galaxies in both simulations and observations, while streams can be found around all kind of galaxies with a slightly higher probability to be present around less rotationally supported galaxies. Tails and satellite planes, however, appear independently of the internal kinematics of the central galaxy, indicating that they are formed through processes that have not (yet) affected the internal kinematics. Conclusions. As shells are formed through radial merger events while streams are remnants of circular merger infall, this suggests that the orbital angular momentum of the merger event could play a more crucial role in transforming the host galaxy than previously anticipated. The existence of a shell around a given slow rotator can further be used to distinguish the radial merger formation scenario from other formation pathways of slow rotators.},

Designed to study the impact of the cluster environment on galaxy formation, they are a key part of the `Cluster-EAGLE' project (Barnes et al. 2017). They use a galaxy formation model developed for the EAGLE project, which has been shown to yield both realistic field galaxies and hot gas fractions of galaxy groups consistent with observations. The total stellar mass content of the simulated clusters agrees with observations, but central cluster galaxies are too massive, by up to 0.6 dex. Passive satellite fractions are higher than in the field, and at stellar masses Mstar {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_Sun this environmental effect is quantitatively consistent with observations. The predicted satellite stellar mass function matches data from local cluster surveys. Normalized to total mass, there are fewer low-mass (Mstar {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_Sun) galaxies within the virial radius of clusters than in the field, primarily due to star formation quenching. Conversely, the simulations predict an overabundance of massive galaxies in clusters compared to the field that persists to their far outskirts ({\textgreater} 5r\_200c). This is caused by a significantly increased stellar mass fraction of (sub-)haloes in the cluster environment, by up to {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex even well beyond r\_200c. Haloes near clusters are also more concentrated than equally massive field haloes, but these two effects are largely uncorrelated.},

To evaluate possible past associations, we devise a globular-cluster--satellite binding criterion based on the satellite's tidal radius and escape velocity and we test it on globular clusters associated with the Sagittarius dwarf and on dwarf galaxies associated with the Large Magellanic Cloud. For these, we successfully recover the dynamical associations highlighted by previous studies and we derive their time of accretion by the Galaxy by using Gaia EDR3 data. Assuming that Milky Way globular clusters are and have been free of dark matter and thus consist of stars alone, we demonstrate that none of the globular clusters show any clear association with the eight classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies even though a large fraction of them are believed to be accreted. This means that accreted globular clusters either came in as part of now-disrupted satellite galaxies or that globular clusters may have had dark matter halos in the past -- as suggested by the similar metallicity between globular clusters and dwarf galaxies.},

	abstract = {We use the Illustris Simulations to gain insight into the build-up of the outer, low-surface brightness regions which surround galaxies. We characterize the stellar haloes by means of the logarithmic slope of the spherically-averaged stellar density profiles, alphaSTARS at z=0, and we relate these slopes to the properties of the underlying Dark-Matter (DM) haloes, their central galaxies, and their assembly histories. We analyze a sample of {\textasciitilde}5,000 galaxies resolved with more than 5x10{\textasciicircum}4 particles each, and spanning a variety of morphologies and halo masses (3x10{\textasciicircum}11 {\textless} Mvir {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}14 Msun). We find a strong trend between stellar halo slope and total halo mass, where more massive objects have shallower stellar haloes than the less massive ones (-5.5 {\textbackslash}pm 0.5 {\textless} alphaSTARS {\textless}-3.5 {\textbackslash}pm 0.2 in the studied mass range). At fixed halo mass, we show that disk-like, blue, young, and more massive galaxies are surrounded by significantly steeper stellar haloes than elliptical, red, older, and less massive galaxies. Overall, the stellar density profiles fall off much more steeply than the underlying DM, and no clear trend holds between stellar slope and DM halo concentration. However, DM haloes which formed more recently, or which accreted larger fractions of stellar mass from infalling satellites, exhibit shallower stellar haloes than their older analogs with similar masses, by up to Delta(alphaSTARS) {\textasciitilde} 0.5-0.7. Our findings, combined with the most recent measurements of the strikingly different stellar power-law indexes for M31 and the Milky Way, appear to favour a massive M31, and a Milky Way characterized by a much quieter accretion history over the past 10 Gyrs than its companion.},

	abstract = {We analyse the merger and assembly histories of Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-like galaxies to quantify how, and how often, disc galaxies of this mass can survive recent major mergers (stellar mass ratio ≥ 1:4). For this, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and identify 198 analog galaxies, selected based on their z = 0 stellar mass (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5-11.2\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$), discy stellar morphology and local environment. First, major mergers are common: 85 per cent (168) of MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG50 have undergone at least one major merger across their lifetime. In fact, 31 galaxies (16 per cent) have undergone a recent major merger, i.e. in the last 5 Gyr. The gas available during the merger suffices to either induce starbursts at pericentric passages or to sustain prolonged star formation after coalescence: in roughly half of the cases, the pre-existing stellar disc is destroyed because of the merger but reforms thanks to star formation. Moreover, higher merger mass ratios are more likely to destroy the stellar discs. In comparison to those with more ancient massive mergers, MW/M31-like galaxies with recent major mergers have, on average, somewhat thicker stellar discs, more massive and somewhat shallower stellar haloes, larger stellar ex situ mass fractions, but similarly massive kinematically defined bulges. All this is qualitatively consistent with the different observed properties of the Galaxy and Andromeda and with the constraints on their most recent major mergers, 8–11 and  2 Gyr ago, respectively. According to contemporary cosmological simulations, a recent quiet merger history is not a pre-requisite for obtaining a relatively thin stellar disc at z = 0.},

	abstract = {The thinness and coldness of galactic disks can be used to set stringent limits on the current rate of infall of satellite systems onto spiral galaxies. After reviewing the literature concerning numerical results, we develop analytical arguments which confirm and considerably extend prior work. For infalling satellites on isotropically oriented circular orbits, we show that, due to scattering, the thermal energy gain of the disk exceeds the satellite energy loss from dynamical friction by a factor of 1.6, with 25\% deposited in z motion and 75\% in planar motions. This factor almost compensates for the frictional loss to the halo, with halo-to-disk loss rates being approximately 2.Slrph(r)/Xd(r). For our chosen Galactic model this corresponds to 62\% of the energy deposited in the spherical component at the solar radius. While satellite infall will thicken disks by perturbing the stellar orbits, it will cause adiabatic contraction too. If there is gas infall, this makes the disk thinner by settling down in the galactic plane. However, the first effect dominates, the ratio between stellar heating and gas cooling being 0.11(t;rot/o-±)2 « 7 for equal masses added in stars and gas.},

We focus on the dependence of the Fall relation's slope on galaxy type and the galaxy properties regulating its scatter. Stellar specific AM is determined by combining single-dish H\{{\textbackslash}sc i\} velocity widths and stellar mass profiles for all H\{{\textbackslash}sc i\} detections in the xGASS sample. At fixed morphology (or bulge-to-total ratio), we find that the power law slope of the Fall relation is consistent with 2/3. However, when all galaxy types are combined, we recover a much shallower slope of \${\textbackslash}sim\$0.47. We show that this is a consequence of the change in galaxy morphology as a function of mass, highlighting that caution should be taken when using the slope of the Fall relation to constrain galaxy formation models without taking sample selection into account. We quantify the Fall relations scatter and show that H\{{\textbackslash}sc i\} gas fraction is the strongest correlated parameter for low stellar masses (Spearman correlation: \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{s\} = 0.61\$), while the bulge-to-total ratio becomes slightly more dominant at higher masses (\${\textbackslash}rho\_\{s\} = -0.29\$). Intriguingly, when only the disc components of galaxies are considered, H\{{\textbackslash}sc i\} gas fraction remains the strongest correlated parameter with the scatter of the relation (regardless of disc stellar mass). Our work provides one of the best characterisations of the Fall relation for a representative sample of galaxies in the local Universe.},

	abstract = {Motivated by new kinematic data in the outer parts of early-type galaxies (ETGs), we re-examine angular momentum (AM) in all galaxy types. We present methods for estimating the specific AM j, focusing on ETGs, to derive relations between stellar j\_* and mass M\_* (after Fall 1983). We perform analyses of 8 galaxies out to {\textasciitilde}10 R\_e, finding that data at 2 R\_e are sufficient to estimate total j\_*. Our results contravene suggestions that ellipticals (Es) harbor large reservoirs of hidden j\_* from AM transport in major mergers. We carry out a j\_*-M\_* analysis of literature data for {\textasciitilde}100 nearby bright galaxies of all types. The Es and spirals form parallel j\_*-M\_* tracks, which for spirals is like the Tully-Fisher relation, but for Es derives from a mass-size-rotation conspiracy. The Es contain {\textasciitilde}3-4 times less AM than equal-mass spirals. We decompose the spirals into disks+bulges and find similar j\_*-M\_* trends to spirals and Es overall. The S0s are intermediate, and we propose that morphological types reflect disk/bulge subcomponents following separate j\_*-M\_* scaling relations -- providing a physical motivation for characterizing galaxies by mass and bulge/disk ratio. Next, we construct idealized cosmological models of AM content, using a priori estimates of dark matter halo spin and mass. We find that the scatter in halo spin cannot explain the spiral/E j\_* differences, but the data are matched if the galaxies retained different fractions of initial j ({\textasciitilde}60\% and {\textasciitilde}10\%). We consider physical mechanisms for j\_* and M\_* evolution (outflows, stripping, collapse bias, merging), emphasizing that the vector sum of such processes must produce the observed j\_*-M\_* relations. A combination of early collapse and multiple mergers (major/minor) may account for the trend for Es. More generally, the observed AM variations represent fundamental constraints for any galaxy formation model.},

From 3D kinematic modeling of the datacubes, we derive extended {\textbackslash}hi{\textbackslash} rotation curves, and from these, we estimate masses of the dark matter halos and specific angular momenta of the discs. We confirm that massive spiral galaxies lie at the upper ends of the Tully-Fisher relation (mass vs velocity, \$M {\textbackslash}propto V{\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$) and Fall relation (specific angular momentum vs mass, \$j {\textbackslash}propto M{\textasciicircum}\{0.6\}\$), in both stellar and baryonic forms, with no significant deviations from single power laws. We study the connections between baryons and dark matter through the stellar (and baryon)-to-halo ratios of mass \$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\} {\textbackslash}equiv M\_{\textbackslash}star/M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{h\}\$ and specific angular momentum \$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{j\} {\textbackslash}equiv j\_{\textbackslash}star/j\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{h\}\$ and \$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{j,bar\} {\textbackslash}equiv j\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{bar\}/j\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{h\}\$. Combining our sample with others from the literature for less massive disc-dominated galaxies, we find that \$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\$ rises monotonically with \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ and \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{h\}\$ (instead of the inverted-U shaped \$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\$ for spheroid-dominated galaxies), while \$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{j\}\$ and \$f\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{j,bar\}\$ are essentially constant near unity over four decades in mass. Our results indicate that disc galaxies constitute a self-similar population of objects closely linked to the self-similarity of their dark halos. This picture is reminiscent of early analytical models of galaxy formation wherein discs grow by relatively smooth and gradual inflow, isolated from disruptive events such as major mergers and strong AGN feedback, in contrast to the more chaotic growth of spheroids.},

We simultaneously collected deep imaging in the g and r Sloan filters using the Large Binocular Cameras (LBCs). The resulting images are 60 times (i.e. {\textasciitilde}4.5 mag) deeper than those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and they have characteristics comparable (in depth and spatial resolution) to the ones expected from the future Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Here we show the first results of our pilot programme targeting NGC1042 (an M33 analogue at a distance of 13.5 Mpc) and its surroundings. The depth of the images allowed us to detect an asymmetric stellar halo in the outskirts of this galaxy whose mass (1.4+-0.4x10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun) is in agreement with the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LambdaCDM) expectations. Additionally, we show that deep imaging from the LBT reveals low mass satellites (a few times 10{\textasciicircum}5 Msun) with very faint central surface brightness muV(0){\textasciitilde}27 mag/arcsec{\textasciicircum}2 (i.e. similar to Local Group dwarf spheroidals, such as Andromeda XIV or Sextans, but at distances well beyond the local volume). The depth and spatial resolution provided by the LIGHTS survey open up a unique opportunity to explore the `missing satellites' problem in a large variety of galaxies beyond our Local Group down to masses where the difference between the theory and observation (if any) should be significant.},

Designed to study the impact of the cluster environment on galaxy formation, they are a key part of the `Cluster-EAGLE' project (Barnes et al. 2017). They use a galaxy formation model developed for the EAGLE project, which has been shown to yield both realistic field galaxies and hot gas fractions of galaxy groups consistent with observations. The total stellar mass content of the simulated clusters agrees with observations, but central cluster galaxies are too massive, by up to 0.6 dex. Passive satellite fractions are higher than in the field, and at stellar masses Mstar {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_Sun this environmental effect is quantitatively consistent with observations. The predicted satellite stellar mass function matches data from local cluster surveys. Normalized to total mass, there are fewer low-mass (Mstar {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}10 M\_Sun) galaxies within the virial radius of clusters than in the field, primarily due to star formation quenching. Conversely, the simulations predict an overabundance of massive galaxies in clusters compared to the field that persists to their far outskirts ({\textgreater} 5r\_200c). This is caused by a significantly increased stellar mass fraction of (sub-)haloes in the cluster environment, by up to {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex even well beyond r\_200c. Haloes near clusters are also more concentrated than equally massive field haloes, but these two effects are largely uncorrelated.},

We run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details of the star-formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects, provided that we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties of winds and circum-galactic media (CGM). Central ({\textasciitilde}kpc) mass concentrations in massive (L*) galaxies are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot halos). Multiple feedback mechanisms play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation; radiative feedback suppresses accretion onto dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in disks.

Previous work have built an understanding of the signatures of these processes contained within galactic stellar halos. This work revisits that picture using seven Milky Way-like galaxies in the {\textbackslash}textit\{Latte\} suite of FIRE-2 cosmological simulations. The resolution of these simulations allows a comparison of contributions from satellites above M\$\_\{*\}\$\${\textbackslash}gtrsim\$10\${\textbackslash}times\$\${\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, enabling the analysis of observable properties for disrupted satellites in a fully self-consistent and cosmological context.

These parameters also govern the resulting dynamical state of an accreted galaxy at \$z=0\$, leading to the expectation that the inner regions of the stellar halo (R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GC\}\}\$ \${\textbackslash}lesssim\$30 kpc) should contain fully phase-mixed debris from both lower and higher mass satellites. In addition, we find that a significant fraction of the lower mass satellites accreted at early times deposit debris in the outer halo (R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{GC\}\}\$ \${\textgreater}\$50 kpc) that are \$not\$ fully phased-mixed, indicating that they could be identified in kinematic surveys.

	abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a ubiquitous numerical method for solving the fluid equations, and is prized for its conservation properties, natural adaptivity, and simplicity. We introduce the Sphenix SPH scheme, which was designed with three key goals in mind: to work well with sub-grid physics modules that inject energy, be highly computationally efficient (both in terms of compute and memory), and to be Lagrangian. Sphenix uses a Density-Energy equation of motion, along with variable artificial viscosity and conduction, including limiters designed to work with common sub-grid models of galaxy formation. In particular, we present and test a novel limiter that prevents conduction across shocks, preventing spurious radiative losses in feedback events. Sphenix is shown to solve many difficult test problems for traditional SPH, including fluid mixing and vorticity conservation, and it is shown to produce convergent behaviour in all tests where this is appropriate. Crucially, we use the same parameters within Sphenix for the various switches throughout, to demonstrate the performance of the scheme as it would be used in production simulations.},

	abstract = {Modern hydrodynamical simulations reproduce many properties of the real Universe. These simulations model various physical processes, but many of these are included using ‘subgrid models’ due to resolution limits. Although different subgrid models have been successful in modelling the effects of supernovae (SNe) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) feedback on galactic properties, it remains unclear if, and by how much, these differing implementations affect observable halo gas properties. In this work, we use ‘zoom-in’ cosmological initial conditions of two volumes selected to resemble the Local Group (LG) evolved with both the Auriga and Apostle galaxy formation models. While the subgrid physics models in both simulations reproduce realistic stellar components of L⋆ galaxies, they exhibit different gas properties. Namely, Auriga predicts that the Milky Way is almost baryonically closed, whereas Apostle suggests that only half of the expected baryons reside within the halo. Furthermore, Apostle predicts that this baryon deficiency extends to the LG (r ≤ 1 Mpc). Some of the baryon deficiency in Apostle is due to SNe feedback at high redshift, which generates halo-wide outflows, with high covering fractions and radial velocities, which both eject baryons and significantly impede cosmic gas accretion. Conversely, in Auriga, gas accretion into the halo appears to be almost unaffected by feedback. These differences appear to result from the different energy injection methods from feedback (both SNe and AGNs) to gas. Our results suggest that both quasar absorption lines and fast radio burst dispersion measures could constrain these two regimes with future observations.},

A mass this large, however, is difficult to reconcile with the small relative tangential velocity of the pair, as well as with the small deceleration from the Hubble flow observed for the most distant LG members. Halo pairs that match these three criteria have average masses a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ times smaller than suggested by the timing argument, but with large dispersion. Guided by these results, we have selected \$12\$ halo pairs with total mass in the range \$1.6\$-\$3.6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ for the APOSTLE project (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment), a suite of hydrodynamical resimulations at various numerical resolution levels (reaching up to \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ per gas particle) that use the subgrid physics developed for the EAGLE project. These simulations reproduce, by construction, the main kinematics of the MW-M31 pair, and produce satellite populations whose overall number, luminosities, and kinematics are in good agreement with observations of the MW and M31 companions. The APOSTLE candidate systems thus provide an excellent testbed to confront directly many of the predictions of the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology with observations of our local Universe.},

The Milky Way’s circular velocity at the solar radius is relatively high, 245 ± 23 km s−1, which helps to reconcile the mass derived from the local Hubble ﬂow with the larger value suggested by the ‘timing argument’. Adopting Planck’s bounds on yields a (local) Hubble constant H0 = 67 ± 5 km s−1 Mpc−1 which is consistent with the value found on cosmological scales. Restricted N-body experiments show that substructures tend to fall on to the LG along the Milky Way–M31 axis, where the quadrupole attraction is maximum. Tests against mock data indicate that neglecting this effect slightly overestimates the LG mass without biasing the rest of model parameters. We also show that both the time dependence of the LG potential and the cosmological constant have little impact on the observed local Hubble ﬂow.},

	abstract = {We present a subgrid model for supernova feedback designed for simulations of galaxy formation. The model uses thermal and kinetic channels of energy injection, which are built upon the stochastic kinetic and thermal models for stellar feedback used in the OWLS and EAGLE simulations, respectively. In the thermal channel, the energy is distributed statistically isotropically and injected stochastically in large amounts per event, which minimizes spurious radiative energy losses. In the kinetic channel, we inject the energy in small portions by kicking gas particles in pairs in opposite directions. The implementation of kinetic feedback is designed to conserve energy, linear momentum and angular momentum, and is statistically isotropic. To test and validate the model, we run simulations of isolated Milky Way-mass and dwarf galaxies, in which the gas is allowed to cool down to 10 K. Using the thermal and kinetic channels together, we obtain smooth star formation histories and powerful galactic winds with realistic mass loading factors. Furthermore, the model produces spatially resolved star formation rates and velocity dispersions that are in agreement with observations. We vary the numerical resolution by several orders of magnitude and find excellent convergence of the global star formation rates and the mass loading of galactic winds. We show that large thermal-energy injections generate a hot phase of the interstellar medium (ISM) and modulate the star formation by ejecting gas from the disc, while the low-energy kicks increase the turbulent velocity dispersion in the neutral ISM, which in turn helps suppress star formation.},

	abstract = {We investigate the formation channels of the intracluster light (ICL) and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in clusters at \$z=0\$. For this, we perform multi-resolution cosmological N-body simulations using the "Galaxy Replacement Technique" (GRT). We study the formation channels of the ICL and BCG as a function of distance from the cluster center and the dynamical state of the clusters at \$z=0\$. To do this, we trace back the stars of the ICL and BCG, and identify the stellar components in which they existed when they first fell into the clusters. We find that the progenitors of the ICL and BCG in the central region of the cluster fell earlier and with a higher total mass ratio of the progenitors to the cluster compared to the outer region. This causes a negative radial gradient in the infall time and total mass ratio of the progenitors. Although stellar mass of the progenitors does not show the same radial gradient in all clusters, massive galaxies (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm\{gal\}\} {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}{\textasciitilde}h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$) are the dominant formation channel of the ICL and BCG for all clusters, except for our most relaxed cluster. For clusters that are dynamically more unrelaxed, we find that the progenitors of the ICL and BCG fall into their clusters more recently, and with a higher mass and mass ratio. Furthermore, we find that the diffuse material of massive galaxies and group-mass halos that is formed by pre-processing contributes significantly to the ICL in the outer region of the unrelaxed clusters.},

	abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the morphology of halos and its evolution are key constraints on the galaxy formation model as well as a determinant parameter of the strong-lensing phenomenon. Using the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE), we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the morphology of galaxy halos and of their mass distributions with a focus on the snapshot at redshift \$z=0.5\$. We developed an iterative strategy involving a principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate the properties of the EAGLE halos and the differences in alignment between the various components. The mass distributions of the dark-matter (DM), gas, and star halos are characterised by a half-mass radius, a concentration parameter and (projected) axis ratios. We present statistics of the shape parameters of 336{\textbackslash},540 halos from the EAGLE RefL0025N0376 simulation and describe their evolution from redshift \$z=15\$ to \$z=0\$. We measured the three-dimensional and two-dimensional projected shape parameters for the DM, the gas, and the star components as well as for all particles. At \$z=0.5\$, the minor axis of gas aligns with the minor axis of DM for massive halos (\$M{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$), but this alignment is poorer for less massive halos. The DM halos axis ratios \$b/a\$ and \$c/a\$ have median values of \$0.82 {\textbackslash}pm 0.11\$ and \$0.64 {\textbackslash}pm 0.12\$, respectively. The sphericity of gas in halos w/ and w/o stars appears to be negatively correlated to the total mass, while the sphericity of DM is insensitive to it. The measured projected axis ratios, \$b\_p/a\_p\$, of star halos at \$z=0.5\$ have a median value of \$0.80 {\textbackslash}pm 0.07\$, which is in good agreement with ground-based and space-based measurements within 1 \${\textbackslash}sigma\$.

Comparing to the ATLAS3D survey, we show that Illustris reproduces similar elliptical galaxy rotation properties, quantified by the degree of ordered rotation, λR. There is a clear segregation between low-mass (M* \&lt; 1011 M⊙) ellipticals, which form a smooth distribution of FRs, and high-mass galaxies (M* \&gt; 1011.5 M⊙), which are mostly SRs, in agreement with observations. We find that SRs are very gas poor, metal rich and red in colour, while FRs are generally more gas rich and still star forming. We suggest that ellipticals begin naturally as FRs and, as they grow in mass, lose their spin and become SRs. While at z = 1, the progenitors of SRs and FRs are nearly indistinguishable, their merger and star formation histories differ thereafter. We find that major mergers tend to disrupt galaxy spin, though in rare cases can lead to a spin-up. No major difference is found between the effects of gas-rich and gas-poor mergers, and the number of minor mergers seems to have little correlation with galaxy spin. In between major mergers, lower mass ellipticals, which are mostly gas rich, tend to recover their spin by accreting gas and stars. For galaxies with M* above ∼1011 M⊙, this trend reverses; galaxies only retain or steadily lose their spin. More frequent mergers, accompanied by an inability to regain spin, lead massive ellipticals to lose most of ordered rotation and transition from FRs to SRs.},

Stellar streams in the Milky Way and Andromeda are spectacular evidence for ongoing satellite disruption. However, constructing a statistically meaningful sample of tidal streams beyond the Local Group has proven a daunting observational challenge, and the full potential for deepening our understanding of galaxy assembly using stellar streams has yet to be realised. Here we introduce the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey, a systematic imaging survey of tidal features associated with dwarf galaxy accretion around a sample of {\textasciitilde}3100 nearby galaxies within z{\textasciitilde}0.02, including about 940 Milky Way analogues. Our survey exploits public deep imaging data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, which reach surface brightness as faint as {\textasciitilde}29 mag/arcsec{\textasciicircum}2 in the r band. As a proof of concept of our survey, we report the detection and broad-band photometry of 24 new stellar streams in the local Universe. We discuss how these observations can yield new constraints on galaxy formation theory through comparison to mock observations from cosmological galaxy simulations. These tests will probe the present-day mass assembly rate of galaxies, the stellar populations and orbits of satellites, the growth of stellar halos and the resilience of stellar disks to satellite bombardment.},

We use auto-GMM to study the stellar kinematic structures of disk galaxies from the TNG100 run of IllustrisTNG. We identify four to ﬁve structures that are commonly present among the diverse galaxy population. Structures having strong to moderate rotation are deﬁned as cold and warm disks, respectively. Spheroidal structures dominated by random motions are classiﬁed as bulges or stellar halos, depending on how tightly bound they are. Disky bulges are structures that have moderate rotation but compact morphology. Across all disky galaxies and accounting for the stellar mass within 3 half-mass radii, the kinematic spheroidal structures, obtained by summing up stars of bulges and halos, contribute ∼45\% of the total stellar mass, while the disky structures constitute ∼55\%. This study also provides important insights into the relationship between kinematically and morphologically derived galactic structures. Comparing the morphology of kinematic structures with that of traditional bulge+disk decomposition, we conclude that (1) the morphologically decomposed bulges are composite structures comprising a slowly rotating bulge, an inner halo, and a disky bulge; (2) kinematically disky bulges, akin to what are commonly called pseudo-bulges in observations, are compact disklike components that have rotation similar to warm disks; (3) halos contribute almost 30\% of the surface density of the outer part of morphological disks when viewed face on; and (4) both cold and warm disks are often truncated in central regions.},

	abstract = {Accreted stellar populations are comprised of the remnants of destroyed galaxies, and often dominate the `stellar haloes' of galaxies such as the Milky Way (MW). This ensemble of external contributors is a key indicator of the past assembly history of a galaxy. We introduce a novel statistical method that uses the unbinned metallicity distribution function (MDF) of a stellar population to estimate the mass spectrum of its progenitors. Our model makes use of the well-known mass-metallicity relation of galaxies and assumes Gaussian MDF distributions for individual progenitors: the overall MDF is thus a mixture of MDFs from smaller galaxies. We apply the method to the stellar halo of the MW, as well as the classical MW satellite galaxies. The stellar components of the satellite galaxies have relatively small sample sizes, but we do not find any evidence for accreted populations with L {\textgreater} L\_host/100. We find that the MW stellar halo has N{\textasciitilde}1-3 massive progenitors (L {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}8 L\_Sun) within 10 kpc, and likely several hundred progenitors in total. We also test our method on simulations of MW-mass haloes, and find that our method is able to recover the true accreted population within a factor of two. Future datasets will provide MDFs with orders of magnitude more stars, and this method could be a powerful technique to quantify the accreted populations down to the ultra-faint dwarf mass-scale for both the MW and its satellites.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04145},
	abstract = {The fates of massive galaxies are tied to the evolution of their central supermassive black holes (BHs), due to the influence of AGN feedback. Correlations within simulated galaxy populations suggest that the masses of BHs are governed by properties of their host dark matter haloes, such as the binding energy and assembly time, at a given halo mass. However, the full picture must be more complex as galaxy mergers have also been shown to influence the growth of BHs and the impact of AGN. In this study, we investigate this problem by using the genetic modification technique to adjust the assembly history of a Milky Way-like galaxy simulated with the EAGLE model. We change the halo assembly time (and hence the binding energy) in the absence of any disruptive merger events, and find little change in the integrated growth of the BH. We attribute this to the angular momentum support provided by a galaxy disc, which reduces the inflow of gas towards the BH and effectively decouples the BH's growth from the properties of the halo. Introducing major mergers into the assembly history disrupts the disc, causing the BH to grow \${\textbackslash}approx 4{\textbackslash}times\$ more massive and inject feedback that reduces the halo baryon fraction by a factor of \${\textbackslash}approx 2\$ and quenches star formation. Merger events appear to be essential to the diversity in BH masses in EAGLE, and we show that they can also significantly increase the halo binding energy, potentially explaining the correlation between these quantities.},

Leading theories1,2 predict that the ICL fraction, defined by the ratio of the ICL to the total light, rapidly decreases with increasing redshift, to the level of a few per cent at z {\textgreater} 1. However, observational studies have remained inconclusive about the fraction beyond redshift unity because, to date, only two clusters in this redshift regime have been investigated. One shows a much lower fraction than the mean value at low redshift3, whereas the other possesses a fraction similar to the low-redshift value4. Here we report an ICL study of ten galaxy clusters at 1 ≲ z ≲ 2 based on deep infrared imaging data. Contrary to the leading theories, our study finds that ICL is already abundant at z ≳ 1, with a mean ICL fraction of approximately 17\%. Moreover, no significant correlation between cluster mass and ICL fraction or between ICL colour and cluster-centric radius is observed. Our findings suggest that gradual stripping can no longer be the dominant mechanism of ICL formation. Instead, our study supports the scenario wherein the dominant ICL production occurs in tandem with the formation and growth of the brightest cluster galaxies and/or through the accretion of preprocessed stray stars.},

These stars are in general more metal-poor than the disk, but surprisingly, half of our halo sample is comprised of stars with [Fe/H]{\textgreater}-1. The orbital directions of these metal-rich halo stars are preferentially aligned with the disk rotation, in sharp contrast with the isotropic orbital distribution of the more metal-poor halo stars. We find similar properties in the Latte cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy from the FIRE project. In Latte, metal-rich halo stars formed primarily inside of the solar circle, while lower-metallicity halo stars preferentially formed at larger distances (extending beyond the virial radius). This suggests that metal-rich halo stars in the Solar neighborhood in fact formed in-situ within the Galactic disk rather than having been accreted from satellite systems. These stars, currently on halo-like orbits, therefore have likely undergone substantial radial migration/heating.},

The models use empirical halo occupation constraints to identify mergers, together with high-resolution simulations to quantify how mergers with different properties contribute to the bulge population. We find good agreement with a variety of observational constraints, and provide fitting functions for merger rates and contributions to bulge growth. We identify several robust conclusions. (1) Major mergers dominate formation and assembly of L* bulges and the spheroid mass density, minor mergers contribute {\textasciitilde}30\%. (2) This is mass-dependent: bulge formation is dominated by more minor mergers in lower-mass systems. At higher masses, bulges form in major mergers near L*, but subsequently assemble in minor mergers. (3) The minor/major contribution is also morphology-dependent: higher B/T systems form in more major mergers, lower B/T systems form in situ from minor mergers. (4) Low-mass galaxies, being gas-rich, require more major mergers to reach the same B/T as high-mass systems. (5) Absolute merger rates increase with galaxy mass. (6) Predicted rates agree well with observations, but suggest that some morphology-selected samples include contamination from minor mergers. (7) Predicted rates agree with integrated growth in bulge mass with cosmic time, but with factor {\textasciitilde}2 uncertainty - half the bulge mass density could come from non-mergers. We consider {\textasciitilde}1000 model variations and quantify resulting uncertainties. Conclusions regarding the major/minor contribution to bulge growth are very robust, absolute merger rates have systematic factor {\textasciitilde}2 uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Using a statistical sample of dark matter haloes drawn from a suite of cosmological N-body simulations of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, we quantify the impact of a simulated halo's mass accretion and merging history on two commonly used measures of its dynamical state, the virial ratio eta and the centre of mass offset Delta r. Quantifying this relationship is important because the degree to which a halo is dynamically equilibrated will influence the reliability with which we can measure characteristic equilibrium properties of the structure and kinematics of a population of haloes. We begin by verifying that a halo's formation redshift zform correlates with its virial mass Mvir and we show that the fraction of its recently accreted mass and the likelihood of it having experienced a recent major merger increases with increasing Mvir and decreasing zform. We then show that both eta and Delta r increase with increasing Mvir and decreasing zform, which implies that massive recently formed haloes are more likely to be dynamically unrelaxed than their less massive and older counterparts. Our analysis shows that both eta and Delta r are good indicators of a halo's dynamical state, showing strong positive correlations with recent mass accretion and merging activity, but we argue that Delta r provides a more robust and better defined measure of dynamical state for use in cosmological N-body simulations at z{\textasciitilde}0. We find that Delta r {\textless} 0.04 is sufficient to pick out dynamically relaxed haloes at z=0.

	abstract = {Galaxy cluster outskirts mark the transition region from the mildly non-linear cosmic web to the highly non-linear, virialised, cluster interior. It is in this transition region that the intracluster medium (ICM) begins to inﬂuence the properties of accreting galaxies and groups, as ram pressure impacts a galaxy’s cold gas content and subsequent star formation rate. Conversely, the thermodynamical properties of the ICM in this transition region should also feel the inﬂuence of accreting substructure (i.e. galaxies and groups), whose passage can drive shocks. In this paper, we use a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations of a single galaxy cluster, drawn from the nIFTy comparison project, to study how the dynamics of substructure accreted from the cosmic web inﬂuences the thermodynamical properties of the ICM in the cluster’s outskirts. We demonstrate how features evident in radial proﬁles of the ICM (e.g. gas density and temperature) can be linked to strong shocks, transient and short-lived in nature, driven by the passage of substructure. The range of astrophysical codes and galaxy formation models in our comparison are broadly consistent in their predictions (e.g. agreeing when and where shocks occur, but differing in how strong shocks will be); this is as we would expect of a process driven by large-scale gravitational dynamics and strong, inefﬁcently radiating, shocks. This suggests that mapping such shock structures in the ICM in a cluster’s outskirts (via e.g. radio synchrotron emission) could provide a complementary measure of its recent merger and accretion history.},

We find that mini mergers deposit a higher fraction of their mass in the outer halo compared to minor mergers, while their contribution to the central mass distribution is highly dependent on the orbital impact parameter: for larger pericentric distances we find that the centre of the host galaxy is almost not contaminated by merger particles. We also find that the median of the resulting radial mass distribution for mini mergers differs significantly from the predictions of simple theoretical tidal-force models. Furthermore, we find that mini mergers can increase the size of the host disc significantly without changing the global shape of the galaxy, if the impact occurs in the disc plane, thus providing a possible explanation for extended low-surface brightness disks reported in observations. Finally, we find clear evidence that streams are a strong indication of nearly circular infall of a satellite (with large angular momentum), whereas the appearance of shells clearly points to (nearly) radial satellite infall.},

Wet (dry) mergers have an average neutral gas-to-stellar mass ratio of \$1.1\$ (\$0.02\$), while major (minor) mergers are those with stellar mass ratios \${\textbackslash}ge 0.3\$ (\$0.1-0.3\$). We correlate the positions of galaxies in the \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm stars\}\$-stellar mass plane at \$z=0\$ with their merger history, and find that galaxies of low spins suffered dry mergers, while galaxies of normal/high spins suffered predominantly wet mergers, if any.

The latter is connected to the build-up of the bulge by newly formed stars of high rotational speed. Moving from minor to major mergers accentuates these effects.

	abstract = {Minor mergers of galaxies are expected to be common in a hierarchical cosmology such as Λ cold dark matter. Though less disruptive than major mergers, minor mergers are more frequent and thus have the potential to affect galactic structure significantly. In this paper, we dissect the case-by-case outcome from a set of numerical simulations of a single satellite elliptical galaxy accreting on to a massive elliptical galaxy. We take care to explore cosmologically relevant orbital parameters and to set up realistic initial galaxy models that include all three relevant dynamical components: dark matter haloes, stellar bulges, and central massive black holes (BHs). The effects of several different parameters are considered, including orbital energy and angular momentum, satellite density and inner density profile, satellite-to-host mass ratio, and presence of a BH at the centre of the host. BHs play a crucial role in protecting the shallow stellar cores of the hosts, as satellites merging on to a host with a central BH are more strongly disrupted than those merging on to hosts without BHs. Orbital parameters play an important role in determining the degree of disruption: satellites on less-bound or more-eccentric orbits are more easily destroyed than those on more-bound or more-circular orbits as a result of an increased number of pericentric passages and greater cumulative effects of gravitational shocking and tidal stripping. In addition, satellites with densities typical of faint elliptical galaxies are disrupted relatively easily, while denser satellites can survive much better in the tidal field of the host. Over the range of parameters explored, we find that the accretion of a single satellite elliptical galaxy can result in a broad variety of changes, in both signs, in the surface brightness profile and colour of the central part of an elliptical galaxy. Our results show that detailed properties of the stellar components of merging satellites can strongly affect the properties of the remnants.},

By quantifying the balance between gas inflows, outflows, and star formation rates, we show that even at \$z=2\$, only \${\textbackslash}approx30{\textbackslash}\%\$ of satellite galaxies are able to maintain equilibrium or grow their reservoir of cool gas - compared to \${\textbackslash}approx50{\textbackslash}\%\$ of central galaxies at this redshift. We find that the number of orbits completed by a satellite is a very good predictor of its quenching, even more so than the time since infall. On average, we show that intermediate-mass satellites with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ between \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ will be quenched at first pericenter in massive group environments, \$M\_\{200\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{13.5\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$; and will be quenched at second pericenter in less massive group environments, \$M\_\{200\}{\textless}10{\textasciicircum}\{13.5\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. On average, more massive satellites (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) experience longer depletion time-scales, being quenched between first and second pericenters in massive groups; while in smaller group environments, just \${\textbackslash}approx30{\textbackslash}\%\$ will be quenched even after two orbits. Our results suggest that while starvation alone may be enough to slowly quench satellite galaxies, direct gas stripping, particularly at pericenters, is required to produce the short quenching time-scales exhibited in the simulation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the tidal stripping process for satellite galaxies orbiting around a massive host galaxy, and focus on its dependence on the morphology of both satellite and host galaxy. For this purpose, we use three different morphologies for the satellites: pure disc, pure bulge and a mixture bulge+disc. Two morphologies are used for the host galaxies: bulge+disc and pure bulge. We find that while the spheroidal stellar component experiences a constant power law like mass removal, the disc is exposed to an exponential mass-loss when the tidal radius of the satellite is of the same order of the disc scalelength. This dramatic mass-loss is able to completely remove the stellar component on time-scale of 100 Myr. As a consequence two satellites with the same stellar and dark matter masses, on the same orbit could either retain considerable fraction of their stellar mass after 10 Gyr or being completely destroyed, depending on their initial stellar morphology. We find that there are two characteristic time-scales describing the beginning and the end of the disc removal, whose values are related to the size of the disc. This result can be easily incorporated in semi-analytical models. We also find that the host morphology and the orbital parameters also have an effect on determining the mass removal, but they are of secondary importance with respect to satellite morphology. We conclude that satellite morphology has a very strong effect on the efficiency of stellar stripping and should be taken into account in modelling galaxy formation and evolution.},

The simulation includes the effects of a uniform UV background, a delayed-radiative-cooling scheme for supernova feedback, and a star formation recipe based on a high gas density threshold. It allows a detailed study of the relative contributions of “in-situ” (within the main host) and “ex-situ” (within satellite galaxies) star formation to each major Galactic component in a close Milky Way analog. We investigate these two star-formation channels as a function of galactocentric distance, along different lines of sight above and along the disk plane, and as a function of cosmic time. We find that: (1) approximately 70\% of today's stars formed in-situ; (2) more than two thirds of the ex-situ stars formed within satellites after infall; (3) the majority of ex-situ stars are found today in the disk and in the bulge; (4) the stellar halo is dominated by ex-situ stars, whereas in-situ stars dominate the mass profile at distances ≲ 5 kpc from the center at high latitudes; and (5) approximately 25\% of the inner, r ≲ 20 kpc, halo is composed of in-situ stars that have been displaced from their original birth sites during Eris' early assembly history.},

	abstract = {Gas-phase metallicities of galaxies are typically measured through auroral or nebular emission lines, but metallicity also leaves an imprint on the overall spectral energy distribution (SED) of a galaxy and can be estimated through SED fitting. We use the ProSpect SED fitting code with a flexible parametric star formation history and an evolving metallicity history to self-consistently measure metallicities, stellar mass, and other galaxy properties for \${\textbackslash}sim90{\textbackslash},000\$ galaxies from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) and Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We use these to trace the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and show that the MZR only evolves in normalisation by \${\textbackslash}sim0.1{\textbackslash},\$dex at stellar mass \$M\_{\textbackslash}star = 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. We find no difference in the MZR between galaxies with and without SED evidence of active galactic nuclei emission at low redshifts (\$z{\textless}0.3\$). Our results suggest an anti-correlation between metallicity and star formation activity at fixed stellar mass for galaxies with \$M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textgreater} 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ for \$z{\textless}0.3\$. Using the star formation histories extracted using ProSpect we explore higher-order correlations of the MZR with properties of the star formation history including age, width, and shape. We find that at a given stellar mass, galaxies with higher metallicities formed most of their mass over shorter timescales, and before their peak star formation rate. This work highlights the value of exploring the connection of a galaxy's current gas-phase metallicity to its star formation history in order to understand the physical processes shaping the MZR.},

	abstract = {Ground-based surveys have mapped the stellar outskirts of Local Group disc galaxies in unprecedented detail, but extending this work to other galaxies is necessary in order to overcome stochastic variations in evolutionary history and provide more stringent constraints on cosmological galaxy formation models. As part of our continuing programme of ultra-deep imagery of galaxies beyond the Local Group, we present a wide-field analysis of the isolated late-type spiral NGC 2403 using data obtained with Suprime-Cam on the Subaru telescope. The surveyed area reaches a maximum projected radius of 30 kpc or a deprojected radius of Rdp∼ 60 kpc. The colour-magnitude diagram reaches 1.5 mag below the tip of the metal-poor red giant branch (RGB) at a completeness rate {\textgreater}50 per cent for Rdp {\textgreater} rsim 12 kpc. Using the combination of diffuse light photometry and resolved star counts, we are able to trace the radial surface brightness (SB) profile over a much larger range of radii and SB than is possible with either technique alone. The exponential disc as traced by RGB stars dominates the SB profile out to ≳8 disc scalelengths, or Rdp∼ 18 kpc, and reaches a V-band SB of μV∼ 29 mag arcsec-2. Beyond this radius, we find evidence for an extended structural component with a significantly flatter SB profile than the inner disc and which we trace to Rdp∼ 40 kpc and μV∼ 32 mag arcsec-2. This component can be fit with a power-law index of γ∼ 3, has an axial ratio consistent with that of the inner disc and has a V-band luminosity integrated over all radii of 1-7 per cent that of the whole galaxy. At Rdp∼ 20 - 30 kpc, we estimate a peak metallicity [M/H] =-1.0 ± 0.3 assuming an age of 10 Gyr and zero α-element enhancement. Although the extant data are unable to discriminate between stellar halo or thick disc interpretations of this component, our results support the notion that faint, extended stellar structures are a common feature of all disc galaxies, even isolated, low-mass systems.},

The resulting color-magnitude diagram reaches over one magnitude below the red giant branch (RGB) tip, allowing a detailed comparison between the young and old stellar spatial distributions. The surface density of stars with ages {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 100 Myr is correlated with that of neutral hydrogen in a manner similar to the disk-averaged Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We trace this correlation down to gas densities of {\textasciitilde} 2 x 10{\textasciicircum}20 cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}, lower than typically probed with H-alpha flux. Both diffuse light and resolved RGB star counts show compelling evidence for a faint, extended structural component beyond the bright optical disk, with a much flatter surface brightness profile. The star counts allow us to probe this component to significantly fainter levels than is possible with the diffuse light alone. From the colors of its RGB stars, we estimate this component has a peak global metallicity [M/H] {\textasciitilde} -1.1 +/- 0.3 at deprojected radii 32 - 44 kpc assuming an age of 10 Gyr and distance of 3.6 Mpc.

We use an extensively-tested analytic model for subhalo infall and evolution and empirical constraints from galaxy survey data to set the stellar mass in each accreted subhalo to model diffuse light. We add stellar mass to the diffuse light as subhalos become disrupted due to interactions within their host halos. We predict that the stellar mass fraction in diffuse, intrahalo light should rise on average from {\textasciitilde}0.5\% to approximately 20\% from small galaxy halos to poor groups. The trend with mass flattens considerably beyond the group scale, increasing weakly from a fraction of {\textasciitilde}20\% in poor galaxy clusters ({\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}14 M\_sun) to roughly {\textasciitilde}30\% in massive clusters ({\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}15 M\_sun). The mass-dependent diffuse light fraction is governed primarily by the empirical fact that the mass-to-light ratio in galaxy halos must vary as a function of halo mass. Galaxy halos have little diffuse light because they accrete most of their mass in small subhalos that themselves have high mass-to-light ratios; stellar halos around galaxies are built primarily from disrupted dwarf-irregular-type galaxies with M*{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}8.5 M\_sun. The diffuse light in group and cluster halos is built from satellite galaxies that form stars efficiently and have correspondingly low mass-to-light ratios; intracluster light is dominated by material liberated from massive galaxies with M*{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_sun. Our results are consistent with existing observations spanning the galaxy, group, and cluster scale; however, they can be tested more rigorously in future deep surveys for faint diffuse light.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the large-scale structure of the halo of the Andromeda galaxy, based on the Pan-Andromeda Archeological Survey (PAndAS), currently the most complete map of resolved stellar populations in any galactic halo. Despite copious substructure, the global halo populations follow closely power law profiles that become steeper with increasing metallicity. We divide the sample into stream-like populations and a smooth halo component. Fitting a three-dimensional halo model reveals that the most metal-poor populations ([Fe/H]{\textless}-1.7) are distributed approximately spherically (slightly prolate with ellipticity c/a=1.09+/-0.03), with only a relatively small fraction (42\%) residing in discernible stream-like structures. The sphericity of the ancient smooth component strongly hints that the dark matter halo is also approximately spherical. More metal-rich populations contain higher fractions of stars in streams (86\% for [Fe/H]{\textgreater}-0.6). The space density of the smooth metal-poor component has a global power-law slope of -3.08+/-0.07, and a non-parametric fit shows that the slope remains nearly constant from 30kpc to 300kpc. The total stellar mass in the halo at distances beyond 2 degrees is 1.1x10{\textasciicircum}10 Solar masses, while that of the smooth component is 3x10{\textasciicircum}9 Solar masses. Extrapolating into the inner galaxy, the total stellar mass of the smooth halo is plausibly 8x10{\textasciicircum}9 Solar masses. We detect a substantial metallicity gradient, which declines from [Fe/H]=-0.7 at R=30kpc to [Fe/H]=-1.5 at R=150kpc for the full sample, with the smooth halo being 0.2dex more metal poor than the full sample at each radius. While qualitatively in-line with expectations from cosmological simulations, these observations are of great importance as they provide a prototype template that such simulations must now be able to reproduce in quantitative detail.},

	abstract = {We use the EAGLE cosmological simulations to study the evolution of the vertical velocity dispersion of cold gas, \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{z\}\$, in central disc galaxies and its connection to stellar feedback, gravitational instabilities, cosmological gas accretion and galaxy mergers. To isolate the impact of feedback, we analyse runs that turn off stellar and (or) AGN feedback in addition to a run that includes both. The evolution of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_z\$ and its dependence on stellar mass and star formation rate in EAGLE are in good agreement with observations. Galaxies hosted by haloes of similar virial mass, \${\textbackslash}rm M\_\{200\}\$, have similar \${\textbackslash}sigma\_z\$ values even in runs where feedback is absent. The prevalence of local instabilities in discs is uncorrelated with \${\textbackslash}sigma\_z\$ at low redshift and becomes only weakly correlated at high redshifts and in galaxies hosted by massive haloes. \${\textbackslash}sigma\_z\$ correlates most strongly with the specific gas accretion rate onto the disc as well as with the degree of misalignment between the inflowing gas and the disc's rotation axis. These correlations are significant across all redshifts and halo masses, with misaligned accretion being the primary driver of high gas turbulence at redshifts \$z {\textbackslash}lesssim 1\$ and for halo masses \${\textbackslash}rm M\_\{200\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.5\} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Galaxy mergers increase \${\textbackslash}sigma\_z\$ but, because of their rarity, play only a minor role in its evolution.

The main goal of this work is to simultaneously compare structural, dynamical, and stellar population measurements in order to identify key areas of success and tension. We have taken great care to ensure that our simulated measurement methods match the observational methods as closely as possible. We find that the Eagle and Hydrangea simulations reproduce many galaxy relations but with some offsets at high stellar masses. There are moderate mismatches in \$R\_e\$ (+), \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ (-), \${\textbackslash}sigma\_e\$ (-), and mean stellar age (+), where a plus sign indicates that quantities are too high on average, and minus sign too low. The Horizon-AGN simulations qualitatively reproduce several galaxy relations, but there are a number of properties where we find a quantitative offset to observations. Massive galaxies are better matched to observations than galaxies at low and intermediate masses. Overall, we find mismatches in \$R\_e\$ (+), \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ (-), \${\textbackslash}sigma\_e\$ (-) and \$(V/{\textbackslash}sigma)\_e\$ (-). Magneticum matches observations well: this is the only simulation where we find ellipticities typical for disk galaxies, but there are moderate differences in \${\textbackslash}sigma\_e\$ (-), \$(V/{\textbackslash}sigma)\_e\$ (-) and mean stellar age (+).

We investigate these trends and the formation paths of slow rotators (SRs) using the EAGLE and Hydrangea hydro-dynamical simulations. EAGLE consists of several cosmological boxes of volumes up to \$(100{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm Mpc){\textasciicircum}3\$, while Hydrangea consists of \$24\$ cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters and their environment. Together they provide a statistically significant sample in the stellar mass range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9.5\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{12.3\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, of \$16,358\$ galaxies. We construct IFS-like cubes and measure stellar spin parameters, \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm R\}\$, and ellipticities, allowing us to classify galaxies into slow/fast rotators as in observations. The simulations display a primary dependence of \$F\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SR\}\$ on stellar mass, with a weak dependence on environment. At fixed stellar mass, satellite galaxies are more likely to be SRs than centrals. \$F\_\{{\textbackslash}rm SR\}\$ shows a dependence on halo mass at fixed stellar mass for central galaxies, while no such trend is seen for satellites. We find that \${\textbackslash}approx 70\$\% of SRs at \$z=0\$ have experienced at least one merger with mass ratio \${\textbackslash}ge 0.1\$, with dry mergers being at least twice more common than wet mergers. Individual dry mergers tend to decrease \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}rm R\}\$, while wet mergers mostly increase it. However, \$30\$\% of SRs at \$z=0\$ have not experienced mergers, and those inhabit halos with median spins twice smaller than the halos hosting the rest of the SRs.

	abstract = {We present CEERS JWST/NIRCam imaging of a massive galaxy group at z=1.85, to explore the early JWST view on massive group formation in the distant Universe. The group contains {\textgreater}16 members (including 6 spectros. confirmations) down to log10(Mstar/Msun)=8.5, including the Brightest Group Galaxy (BGG) in the process of actively assembling at this redshift. The BGG is comprised of multiple merging components extending {\textasciitilde}3.6" (30kpc) across the sky. The BGG contributes 69\% of the group's total galactic stellar mass, with one of the merging components containing 76\% of the total mass of the BGG and a SFR{\textgreater}1810Msun/yr. Most importantly, we detect intra-halo light (IHL) in several HST and JWST/NIRCam bands, allowing us to construct a state-of-the-art rest-frame UV-NIR Spectral Energy Distribution of the IHL for the first time at this high redshift. This allows stellar population characterisation of both the IHL and member galaxies, as well as the morphology distribution of group galaxies vs. their star-formation activity when coupled with Herschel data. We create a stacked image of the IHL, giving us a sensitivity to extended emission of 28.5 mag/arcsec2 at rest-frame 1um. We find that the IHL is extremely dust poor (Av{\textasciitilde}0), containing an evolved stellar population of log10(t50/yr)=8.8, corresponding to a formation epoch for 50\% of the stellar material 0.63Gyr before z=1.85. There is no evidence of ongoing star-formation in the IHL. The IHL in this group at z=1.85 contributes {\textasciitilde}10\% of the total stellar mass, comparable with what is observed in local clusters. This suggests that the evolution of the IHL fraction is more self-similar with redshift than predicted by some models, challenging our understanding of IHL formation during the assembly of high-redshift clusters. JWST is unveiling a new side of group formation at this redshift, which will evolve into Virgo-like structures in the local Universe.},

We present the most extended IGL measurement to date, reaching down to \${\textbackslash}mu\_\{g\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm\{lim\}\}=30.76\$ mag arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ (\$3 {\textbackslash}sigma\$; \$10 {\textbackslash}times 10\$ arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$) at a semi-major axis of 275 kpc. The IGL shows mean colour values of \$g-i=0.92\$, \$g-r=0.60\$, and \$r-i=0.32\$ (\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.01). The IGL stellar populations are younger (\$2-2.5\$ Gyr) and less metal-rich ([Fe/H] \$ {\textbackslash}sim -\$0.4) than those of the host group galaxies. We find a range of IGL fractions as a function of total group luminosity of \${\textbackslash}sim 2-36 {\textbackslash}\%\$ depending on the definition of IGL, with larger fractions the bluer the observation wavelength. The early-type to late-type galaxy ratio suggests that 400138 is a more evolved group, dominated by ETGs, and the IGL fraction agrees with that of other similarly evolved groups. These results are consistent with tidal stripping of the outer parts of Milky Way-like galaxies as the main driver of the IGL build-up. This is supported by the detection of substructure in the IGL towards the galaxy member 1660615 suggesting a recent interaction (\${\textless}1\$ Gyr ago) of that galaxy with the core of the group.},

These codes span a wide range of techniques including friends-of-friends (FOF), spherical-overdensity (SO) and phase-space based algorithms. We further introduce a robust (and publicly available) suite of test scenarios that allows halo finder developers to compare the performance of their codes against those presented here. This set includes mock haloes containing various levels and distributions of substructure at a range of resolutions as well as a cosmological simulation of the large-scale structure of the universe. All the halo finding codes tested could successfully recover the spatial location of our mock haloes. They further returned lists of particles (potentially) belonging to the object that led to coinciding values for the maximum of the circular velocity profile and the radius where it is reached. All the finders based in configuration space struggled to recover substructure that was located close to the centre of the host halo and the radial dependence of the mass recovered varies from finder to finder. Those finders based in phase space could resolve central substructure although they found difficulties in accurately recovering its properties. Via a resolution study we found that most of the finders could not reliably recover substructure containing fewer than 30-40 particles. However, also here the phase space finders excelled by resolving substructure down to 10-20 particles. By comparing the halo finders using a high resolution cosmological volume we found that they agree remarkably well on fundamental properties of astrophysical significance (e.g. mass, position, velocity, and peak of the rotation curve).},

	abstract = {We derive the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR), namely \$f\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}propto M\_{\textbackslash}star/M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ versus \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$, for early-type galaxies from their near-IR luminosities (for \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$) and the position-velocity distributions of their globular cluster systems (for \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$). Our individual estimates of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ are based on fitting a dynamical model with a distribution function expressed in terms of action-angle variables and imposing a prior on \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ from the concentration-mass relation in the standard \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology. We find that the SHMR for early-type galaxies declines with mass beyond a peak at \$M\_{\textbackslash}star{\textbackslash}sim 5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ (near the mass of the Milky Way). This result is consistent with the standard SHMR derived by abundance matching for the general population of galaxies, and with previous, less robust derivations of the SHMR for early types. However, it contrasts sharply with the monotonically rising SHMR for late types derived from extended HI rotation curves and the same \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM prior on \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ as we adopt for early types. The SHMR for massive galaxies varies more or less continuously, from rising to falling, with decreasing disc fraction and decreasing Hubble type. We also show that the different SHMRs for late and early types are consistent with the similar scaling relations between their stellar velocities and masses (Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations). Differences in the relations between the stellar and halo virial velocities account for the similarity of the scaling relations. We argue that all these empirical findings are natural consequences of a picture in which galactic discs are built mainly by smooth and gradual inflow, regulated by feedback from young stars, while galactic spheroids are built by a cooperation between merging, black-hole fuelling, and feedback from AGNs.},

The stars with halo-like kinematics lie along a lower sequence in [Mg/Fe], while the stars with disk-like kinematics lie along a higher sequence. Through with asteroseismic observations, we determine the stars with halo-like kinematics are old, 9-11 Gyr and that the more evolved stellar disk is about 1-2 Gyr younger. We show that the in situ fraction of stars on deeply bound orbits is not small, in fact the inner Galaxy likely harbours a genuine in-situ population together with an accreted one. In addition, we show that the selection of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus in the En-Lz plane is not very robust. In fact, radically different selection criteria give almost identical elemental abundance signatures for the accreted stars.},

We find that discrepancies between the the simulated and observed discs arise both on global and on local scales. Globally, the simulated discs inhabit halos that are a factor {\textasciitilde}4 (in EAGLE) and {\textasciitilde}2 (in IllustrisTNG) more massive than those derived from the rotation curve analysis of the observed dataset. We also use synthetic rotation curves of the simulated discs to demonstrate that the recovery of the halo masses from rotation curves are not systematically biased. We find that the simulations predict dark-matter dominated systems with stellar-to-total enclosed mass ratios that are a factor of 1.5-2 smaller than real galaxies at all radii. This is an alternative manifestation of the `failed feedback problem', since it indicates that simulated halos hosting massive discs have been too inefficient at converting their baryons into stars, possibly due to an overly efficient stellar and/or AGN feedback implementation.},

	abstract = {We use a suite of idealised N-body simulations to study the impact of spurious heating of star particles by dark matter particles on the kinematics and morphology of simulated galactic discs. We find that spurious collisional heating leads to a systematic increase of the azimuthal velocity dispersion (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_{\textbackslash}phi\$) of stellar particles and a corresponding decrease in their mean azimuthal velocities (\${\textbackslash}overline\{v\}\_{\textbackslash}phi\$). The rate of heating is dictated primarily by the number of dark matter halo particles (or equivalently, by the dark matter particle mass at fixed halo mass) and by radial gradients in the local dark matter density along the disc; it is largely insensitive to the stellar particle mass. Galaxies within haloes resolved with fewer than \${\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}6\$ dark matter particles are particularly susceptible to spurious morphological evolution, irrespective of the total halo mass (with even more particles required to prevent heating of the galactic centre). Collisional heating transforms galactic discs from flattened structures into rounder spheroidal systems, causing them to lose rotational support in the process. It also affects the locations of galaxies in standard scaling relations that link their various properties: at fixed stellar mass, it increases the sizes of galaxies, and reduces their mean stellar rotation velocities and specific angular momenta. Our results urge caution when extrapolating simulated galaxy scaling relations to low masses where spurious collisional effects can bias their normalisation, slope and scatter.},

We show that M*-M relations from abundance matching or halo modelling reported in recent studies underestimate stellar masses of BCGs by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2-4, because these studies used stellar mass functions (SMF) based on photometry that severely underestimates the outer surface brightness profiles of massive galaxies. We show that M*-M relation derived using abundance matching with the recent SMF calibration by Bernardi et al. (2013) based on improved photometry is in a much better agreement with the relation we derive. The total stellar mass of galaxies correlates with total mass M500 with the slope of {\textbackslash}approx 0.6+-0.1 and scatter of 0.1 dex. This indicates that efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars decreases with increasing cluster mass. We show that for a fixed choice of the initial mass function (IMF) total stellar fraction in clusters is only a factor of {\textasciitilde}3-5 lower than the peak stellar fraction reached in M{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun halos, and only a factor of {\textasciitilde}1.5-3 if the IMF becomes progressively more bottom heavy with increasing mass in early type galaxies, as indicated by recent observations. The larger normalization and slope of the M*-M relation derived in this study shows that the overall efficiency of star formation in massive halos is suppressed much less than was thought before and that feedback and associated suppression of star formation in massive halos should be weaker than assumed in most of the current semi-analytic models and simulations.},

The ICL appears as faint and diffuse light extending to at least 1 Mpc from the cluster center, reaching a surface brightness level of 30 mag arcsec\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$. The ICL and the cluster CG contribute to \$44{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash}pm17\${\textbackslash}\% of the total cluster stellar luminosity within 1 Mpc. The ICL color is overall consistent with that of the cluster red sequence galaxies, but displays the trend of becoming bluer with increasing radius. The ICL demonstrates an interesting self-similarity feature -- for clusters in different richness ranges, their ICL radial profiles are similar after scaling with cluster \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{200m\}\$, and the ICL brightness appears to be a good tracer of the cluster radial mass distribution. These analyses are based on the DES redMaPPer cluster sample identified in the first year of observations.},

We track the main progenitor of each halo at z = 0 and search for merger situations based on its mass accretion history, defining mergers as very rapid increases in the halo mass. Based upon the evolution of the dynamical state of the cluster we define a pre- and post-merger phase. We create a list of all these events and statistically study their mass ratio and time-scales, with the former verifying that all instances are in fact major mergers. By comparing to a control sample of clusters without mergers, we study the effect mergers have on the stellar component of the BCG. Analysing the mass, age, and metallicity of the BCG stellar particles, we find that the stellar content of BCGs grows significantly during mergers and, even though the main growth mechanism is the accretion of older stars, there is even a burst in star formation induced by the merger. In our simulations, BCGs in mergers form in median around 70 per cent more stars than those normally growing, although this depends on the radius considered for defining the BCG. Regarding observable properties, we see an increase in SDSS-u luminosity of 20 per cent during mergers, accompanied by a slightly slower increase of the galaxy g - r colour as compared to the control sample.},

	abstract = {The ever increasing size and complexity of data coming from simulations of cosmic structure formation demand equally sophisticated tools for their analysis. During the past decade, the art of object finding in these simulations has hence developed into an important discipline itself. A multitude of codes based upon a huge variety of methods and techniques have been spawned yet the question remained as to whether or not they will provide the same (physical) information about the structures of interest. Here we summarize and extent previous work of the `halo finder comparison project': we investigate in detail the (possible) origin of any deviations across finders. To this extent, we decipher and discuss differences in halo-finding methods, clearly separating them from the disparity in definitions of halo properties. We observe that different codes not only find different numbers of objects leading to a scatter of up to 20 per cent in the halo mass and Vmax function, but also that the particulars of those objects that are identified by all finders differ. The strength of the variation, however, depends on the property studied, e.g. the scatter in position, bulk velocity, mass and the peak value of the rotation curve is practically below a few per cent, whereas derived quantities such as spin and shape show larger deviations. Our study indicates that the prime contribution to differences in halo properties across codes stems from the distinct particle collection methods and - to a minor extent - the particular aspects of how the procedure for removing unbound particles is implemented. We close with a discussion of the relevance and implications of the scatter across different codes for other fields such as semi-analytical galaxy formation models, gravitational lensing and observables in general.},

	abstract = {Stellar-population analyses of today's galaxies show `downsizing', where the stars in more massive galaxies tend to have formed earlier and over a shorter time-span. We show that this phenomenon is not necessarily `antihierarchical' but rather has its natural roots in the bottom-up clustering process of dark-matter haloes. While the main progenitor does indeed show an opposite effect, the integrated mass in all the progenitors down to a given minimum mass shows a robust downsizing that is qualitatively similar to what has been observed. These results are derived analytically from the standard extended Press-Schechter (EPS) theory, and are confirmed by merger trees based on EPS or drawn from N-body simulations. The downsizing is valid for any minimum mass, as long as it is the same for all haloes at any given time, but the effect is weaker for smaller minimum mass. If efficient star formation is triggered by atomic cooling, then a minimum halo mass arises naturally from the minimum virial temperature for cooling, T {\textasciitilde}= 104 K, though for such a small minimum mass the effect is weaker than observed. Baryonic feedback effects, which are expected to stretch the duration of star formation in small galaxies and shut it down in massive haloes at late epochs, are likely to play a subsequent role in shaping up the final downsizing behaviour. Other appearances of downsizing, such as the decline with time of the typical mass of star-forming galaxies, may not be attributed to the gravitational clustering process but rather arise from the gas processes.},

We find that the ‘two-phase’ picture of galaxy formation predicted by some models is a good approximation only for the most massive galaxies in our simulation – namely, the stellar mass growth of galaxies below a few times 1011 M⊙ is dominated by in situ star formation at all redshifts. The fraction of the total stellar mass of galaxies at z = 0 contributed by accreted stars shows a strong dependence on galaxy stellar mass, ranging from about 10 per cent for Milky Way-sized galaxies to over 80 per cent for M* ≈ 1012 M⊙ objects, yet with a large galaxy-to-galaxy variation. At a fixed stellar mass, elliptical galaxies and those formed at the centres of younger haloes exhibit larger fractions of ex situ stars than disc-like galaxies and those formed in older haloes. On average, ∼50 per cent of the ex situ stellar mass comes from major mergers (stellar mass ratio μ \&gt; 1/4), ∼20 per cent from minor mergers (1/10 \&lt; μ \&lt; 1/4), ∼20 per cent from very minor mergers (μ \&lt; 1/10), and ∼10 per cent from stars that were stripped from surviving galaxies (e.g. flybys or ongoing mergers). These components are spatially segregated, with in situ stars dominating the innermost regions of galaxies, and ex situ stars being deposited at larger galactocentric distances in order of decreasing merger mass ratio.},

But these methods are expensive for large galaxy samples. Instead, integral-field spectroscopic can efficiently recognize the shape, dynamics and stellar population of complete samples of early-type galaxies (ETGs). These studies showed that the two main classes, the fast and slow rotators, can be separated using stellar kinematics. We showed there is a dichotomy in the dynamics of the two classes. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial and dominate above \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}{\textbackslash}approx2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Below \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm crit\}\$, the structure of fast rotators parallels that of spiral galaxies. There is a smooth sequence along which, the metals content, the enhancement in \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-elements, and the "weight" of the stellar initial mass function, all increase with the CENTRAL mass density slope, or bulge mass fraction, while the molecular gas fraction correspondingly decreases. The properties of ETGs on galaxy scaling relations, and in particular the \$(M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}, R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\})\$ diagram, and their dependence on environment, indicate two main independent channels for galaxy evolution. Fast rotators ETGs start as star forming disks and evolve trough a channel dominated by gas accretion, bulge growth and quenching. While slow rotators assemble near the center of massive halos via intense star formation at high redshift, and remain as such for the rest of their evolution via a channel dominated by gas poor mergers. This is consistent with independent studies of the galaxies redshift evolution.},

The sample lies at an average distance of r {\textasciitilde}24 kpc from the Galactic center, with a root-mean-square spread of 6 kpc. At this distance, the median PM accuracy is 5 km/s. We devise a maximum likelihood routine to determine the tangential velocity ellipsoid of the stellar halo. The velocity second moments in the directions of the Galactic (l,b) system are {\textless} vl{\textasciicircum}2 {\textgreater}{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\} = 123 (+29, -23) km/s, and {\textless} vb{\textasciicircum}2 {\textgreater}{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\} = 83 (+24, -16) km/s. We combine these results with the known line-of-sight second moment, {\textless} vlos{\textasciicircum}2 {\textgreater}{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\} = 105 {\textbackslash}pm 5\$ km/s, at this {\textless} r {\textgreater} to study the velocity anisotropy of the halo. We find approximate isotropy between the radial and tangential velocity distributions, with anisotropy parameter beta = 0.0 (+0.2, -0.4). Our results suggest that the stellar halo velocity anisotropy out to r {\textasciitilde} 30 kpc is less radially biased than solar neighborhood measurements. This is opposite to what is expected from violent relaxation, and may indicate the presence of a shell-type structure at r {\textasciitilde} 24 kpc. With additional multi-epoch HST data, the method presented here has the ability to measure the transverse kinematics of the halo for more stars, and to larger distances. This can yield new improved constraints on the stellar halo formation mechanism, and the mass of the Milky Way.},

We find 2 shells in the Virgo Overdensity (VOD) region and 2 shells in the Hercules Aquila Cloud (HAC) region using Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Gaia, and LAMOST data. These shell stars are a subset of the substructure previously identified as the Virgo Radial Merger (VRM). Timing arguments for these shells indicate that their progenitor dwarf galaxy passed through the Galactic center 2.7 +/- 0.2 Gyr ago. Based on the time of collision, it is also possible that the VRM is related to the phenomenon that created phase-space spirals in the vertical motion of the disk and/or the Splash, and could have caused a burst of star formation in the inner disk. We analyze phase mixing in a collection of radial merger N-body simulations, and find that shell structure similar to that observed in Milky Way data disappears by 5 Gyr after collision with the Galactic center. The method used to calculate the merger time of the VRM was able to reliably recover the correct merger times for these simulations. Previous work supports the idea that the VRM and the Gaia Sausage/Gaia-Enceladus Merger are the same. However, the Gaia Sausage is widely believed to be 8--11 Gyr old. The disparate ages could be reconciled if the larger age is associated with an infall time when the progenitor crossed the virial radius; we do not constrain the time at which the progenitor became bound to the Milky Way. Alternatively, the Gaia Sausage could be younger than previously thought.},

Using this sample, we measure no change in the ICL's stellar content (between 50-300{\textbackslash},kpc) over this redshift range in clusters with log\$\_\{10\}(M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 200m,SZ\}\$/M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}){\textgreater}\$14.4.

The outskirts are more strongly correlated with the halo than the core, which supports that the BCG+ICL system follows a two-phase growth, where recent growth (\$z{\textless}2\$) occurs beyond the BCG's core. Additionally, we compare our observed SMHM relation results to the IllustrisTNG 300-1 cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and find moderate qualitative agreement in the amount of diffuse light. However, the SMHM relation's slope is steeper in TNG300-1 and the intrinsic scatter is lower, likely from the absence of projection effects in TNG300-1. Additionally, we find that the ICL exhibits a colour gradient such that the outskirts are bluer than the core. Moreover, for the lower halo mass clusters (log\$\_\{10\}(M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 200m,SZ\}\$/M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}){\textless}\$14.59 ), we detect a modest change in the colour gradient's slope with lookback time, which combined with the absence of stellar mass growth may suggest that lower mass clusters have been involved in growth via tidal stripping more recently than their higher mass counterparts.},

To investigate the BCG-ICL transition, we stack the images of ∼3000 clusters between 0.2{\textless}𝑧{\textless}0.3 in the SDSS 𝑔𝑟𝑖 bands, and measure their BCG+ICL stellar surface mass proﬁle ΣB∗+I down to 3×104 𝑀 /kpc2 at 𝑅 1 Mpc (∼32 mag/arcsec2 in the 𝑟-band). We develop a physically-motivated method to decompose ΣB∗+I into three components, including an inner de Vaucouleurs’ proﬁle, an outer ICL that follows the dark matter distribution measured from weak lensing, and an intriguing transitional component between 70 and 200 kpc. To investigate the origin of this transition, we split the clusters into two subsamples by their BCG stellar mass 𝑀∗BCG (mass enclosed roughly within 50 kpc) while making sure they have the same distribution of satellite richness. The ΣB∗+I proﬁles of the two subsamples diﬀer by more than a factor of two at R {\textless} 50 kpc, consistent with their 0.34 dex diﬀerence in 𝑀∗BCG, whereas on scales beyond 400 kpc the two proﬁles converge to the same amplitudes, suggesting a satellite-stripping origin of the outer ICL. Remarkably, however, the discrepancy between the two ΣB∗+I proﬁles persist at above 50\% level on all scales below 200 kpc, thereby revealing the BCG sphere of inﬂuence with radius 𝑅SOI 200 kpc. Finally, we speculate that the surprisingly large sphere of inﬂuence of the BCG is tied to the elevated escape velocity proﬁle within 𝑟𝑠, the characteristic radius of the dark matter haloes.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, Machine Learning techniques offer fast and efficient solutions for classification problems that would require intensive computational resources via traditional methods. We examine the use of a supervised Random Forest to classify stars in simulated galaxy clusters after subtracting the member galaxies. These dynamically different components are interpreted as the individual properties of the stars in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) and IntraCluster Light (ICL). We employ matched stellar catalogues (built from the different dynamical properties of BCG and ICL) of 29 simulated clusters from the DIANOGA set to train and test the classifier. The input features are cluster mass, normalized particle cluster-centric distance, and rest-frame velocity. The model is found to correctly identify most of the stars, while the larger errors are exhibited at the BCG outskirt, where the differences between the physical properties of the two components are less obvious. We investigate the robustness of the classifier to numerical resolution, redshift dependence (up to \$z=1\$), and included astrophysical models. We claim that our classifier provides consistent results in simulations for \$z{\textless}1\$, at different resolution levels and with significantly different subgrid models. The phase-space structure is examined to assess whether the general properties of the stellar components are recovered: (i) the transition radius between BCG-dominated and ICL-dominated region is identified at \$0.04\$ {\textbackslash}r200; (ii) the BCG outskirt (\${\textgreater} 0.1\$ {\textbackslash}r200) is significantly affected by uncertainties in the classification process. In conclusion, this work suggests the importance of employing Machine Learning to speed up a computationally expensive classification in simulations.},

We find that the spheroid/disk mass distributions for individual galaxy morphological types are well described by single Schechter function forms. We derive estimates of the total stellar mass densities in spheroids (rho\_spheroid = 1.24+/-0.49 * 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_sun Mpc{\textasciicircum}-3 h\_0.7) and disks (rho\_disk = 1.20+/-0.45 * 10{\textasciicircum}8 M\_sun Mpc{\textasciicircum}-3 h\_0.7), which translates to approximately 50\% of the local stellar mass density in spheroids and 48\% in disks. The remaining stellar mass is found in the dwarf "little blue spheroid" class, which is not obviously similar in structure to either classical spheroid or disk populations. We also examine the variation of component mass ratios across galaxy mass and group halo mass regimes, finding the transition from spheroid to disk mass dominance occurs near galaxy stellar mass {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}11 M\_sun and group halo mass {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}12.5 M\_sun/h. We further quantify the variation in spheroid-to-total mass ratio with group halo mass for central and satellite populations as well as the radial variation of this ratio within groups.},

	abstract = {Radiative feedback (RFB) from stars plays a key role in galaxies, but remains poorly understood. We explore this using high-resolution, multifrequency radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We study ultrafaint dwarf through Milky Way mass scales, including H+He photoionization; photoelectric, Lyman Werner, Compton, and dust heating; and single+multiple scattering radiation pressure (RP). We compare distinct numerical algorithms: ray-based LEBRON (exact when optically thin) and moments-based M1 (exact when optically thick). The most important RFB channels on galaxy scales are photoionization heating and single-scattering RP: in all galaxies, most ionizing/far-UV luminosity (∼1/2 of lifetime-integrated bolometric) is absorbed. In dwarfs, the most important effect is photoionization heating from the UV background suppressing accretion. In MW-mass galaxies, metagalactic backgrounds have negligible effects; but local photoionization and single-scattering RP contribute to regulating the galactic star formation efﬁciency and lowering central densities. Without some RFB (or other ‘rapid’ FB), resolved GMCs convert too-efﬁciently into stars, making galaxies dominated by hyperdense, bound star clusters. This makes star formation more violent and ‘bursty’ when SNe explode in these hyperclustered objects: thus, including RFB ‘smoothes’ SFHs. These conclusions are robust to RHD methods, but M1 produces somewhat stronger effects. Like in previous FIRE simulations, IR multiple-scattering is rare (negligible in dwarfs, ∼ 10 per cent of RP in massive galaxies): absorption occurs primarily in ‘normal’ GMCs with AV ∼ 1.},

	abstract = {We present a model for the formation of the first galaxies before and after the reionization of hydrogen in the early universe. In this model, galaxy formation can only take place in dark matter haloes whose mass exceeds a redshift-dependent critical value, which, before reionization, is equal (in the simplest case) to the mass at which atomic hydrogen cooling becomes effective and, after reionization, is equal to the mass above which gas cannot remain in hydrostatic equilibrium. We define the Halo Occupation Fraction (HOF) as the fraction of haloes that host a luminous galaxy as a function of halo mass. The HOF is established by the interplay between the evolution of the critical mass and the assembly history of haloes and depends on three factors: the minimum halo mass for galaxy formation before reionization, the redshift of reionization, and the intensity of the (evolving) external photoheating rate. Our fiducial model predicts a cutoff in the galaxy mass function at a present-day halo mass, \$M\_\{200\} {\textbackslash}sim 3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{8\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$; 100 per cent occupation at \$M\_\{200\} {\textbackslash}gt 5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}9 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$; and a population of starless gaseous haloes of present-day mass in the range 106 ≲ M200/M⊙ ≲ 5 × 109, in which the gas is in thermal equilibrium with the ultraviolet background radiation and in hydrostatic equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the halo. The transition between HOF = 0 and HOF = 1 reflects the stochastic nature of halo mass growth. We explore how these characteristic masses vary with model assumptions and parameter values. The results of our model are in excellent agreement with cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation.},

We outline both the areas in which highly accurate predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter halos hosting cluster, their mass function and clustering properties. Their study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar fractions, the thermodynamical and non-thermal processes in the intracluster plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the observed thermal properties of the intra-cluster plasma exhibit the most regular behavior and thus can be used to define robust observational proxies for the total cluster mass. We put particular emphasis on examining assumptions and limitations of the widely used self-similar model of clusters. Finally, we discuss the formation of clusters in non-standard cosmological models, such as non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified gravity, along with prospects for testing these alternative scenarios with large cluster surveys in the near future.},

	abstract = {A number of arguments lead one to consider the possibility that the first massive galaxies were formed after redshift 10. The formation of galaxies at small redshifts can only have occurred if the formation process was dissipative. This paper is concerned with one theory of dissipative galaxy formation—the theory which arises from the supposition that a protogalactic cloud would not have fragmented very extensively during the first phase of its infall and thus that the collapse of the cloud would be halted by the formation of shock fronts around a caustic surface. Detailed calculations of the formation and evolution of these shock fronts yield values for the physical conditions of the protogalactic gas and the rate of radiation of galactic binding energy by such shocks. The adiabaticity or isothermality of these shock fronts is found to be dependent on the characteristic infall velocity and the surface density associated with the shock front but not on the shape of the initial density profile perpendicular to the incipient shock surfaces. Protogalaxies which recollapsed at high z are more likely to have generated isothermal shocks than ones which collapsed at low z. It is found that this binding energy release could make collapsing protogalactic clouds very high surface brightness objects. It appears that there is a scale radius {\textasciitilde} 30 kpc associated with the collapse of the most massive galaxies and that it may be possible to explain the original inability of the material of galactic disks to fragment in terms of this scale radius. A similar theory of the origin of Magellanic irregulars, low surface brightness spheroidals, and dwarf ellipticals is suggested.},

The EAGLE simulations reproduce the observed present-day galaxy stellar mass function, as well as many other properties of the galaxy population as a function of time. We find significant differences between the masses of haloes in the EAGLE simulations and in simulations that follow only the dark matter component. Nevertheless, haloes are well described by the Navarro–Frenk–White density profile at radii larger than ∼5 per cent of the virial radius but, closer to the centre, the presence of stars can produce cuspier profiles. Central enhancements in the total mass profile are most important in haloes of mass 1012–1013 M⊙, where the stellar fraction peaks. Over the radial range where they are well resolved, the resulting galaxy rotation curves are in very good agreement with observational data for galaxies with stellar mass M* \&lt; 5 × 1010 M⊙.

The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

A first paper in this series concentrated on disc properties. Here, we extend this analysis to study how the formation history, structure and dynamics of discs and spheroids relate to the assembly history and structure of their haloes. We find that discs are generally young, with stars spanning a wide range in stellar age: the youngest stars define thin discs and have near-circular orbits, while the oldest stars form thicker discs which rotate {\textasciitilde}2 times slower than the thin components, and have 2-3 times larger velocity dispersions. Unlike the discs, spheroids form early and on short time-scales, and are dominated by velocity dispersion. We find great variety in their structure. The inner regions are bar- or bulge-like, while the extended outer haloes are rich in complex non-equilibrium structures such as stellar streams, shells and clumps. Our discs have very high in-situ fractions, i.e. most of their stars formed in the disc itself. Nevertheless, there is a non-negligible contribution ({\textasciitilde}15 percent) from satellites that are accreted on nearly coplanar orbits. The inner regions of spheroids also have relatively high in-situ fractions, but 65-85 percent of their outer stellar population is accreted. We analyse the circular velocities, rotation velocities and velocity dispersions of our discs and spheroids, both for gas and stars, showing that the dynamical structure is complex as a result of the non-trivial interplay between cooling and SN heating.},

	abstract = {We present the properties of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like (MW/M31-like) galaxies simulated within TNG50, the highest-resolution run of the IllustrisTNG suite of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. We introduce our fiducial selection for MW/M31 analogs, which we propose for direct usage as well as for reference in future analyses. TNG50 contains 198 MW/M31 analogs, i.e. galaxies with stellar disky morphology, with a stellar mass in the range of \$M\_* = 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5 - 11.2\}\$ Msun, and within a MW-like Mpc-scale environment at z=0. These are resolved with baryonic (dark matter) mass resolution of \$8.5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}4\$ Msun (\$4.5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}5\$ Msun) and \${\textbackslash}sim150\$ pc of average spatial resolution in the star-forming regions: we therefore expand by many factors (2 orders of magnitude) the sample size of cosmologically-simulated analogs with similar (\${\textbackslash}times 10\$ better) numerical resolution. The majority of TNG50 MW/M31 analogs at \$z=0\$ exhibit a bar, 60 per cent are star-forming, the sample includes 3 Local Group (LG)-like systems, and a number of galaxies host one or more satellites as massive as e.g. the Magellanic Clouds. Even within such a relatively narrow selection, TNG50 reveals a great diversity in galaxy and halo properties, as well as in past histories. Within the TNG50 sample, it is possible to identify several simulated galaxies whose integral and structural properties are consistent, one or more at a time, with those measured for the Galaxy and Andromeda. With this paper, we document and release a series of broadly applicable data products that build upon the IllustrisTNG public release and aim to facilitate easy access and analysis by public users. These include datacubes across snapshots (\$0 {\textbackslash}le z {\textbackslash}le 7\$) for each TNG50 MW/M31-like galaxy, and a series of value-added catalogs that will be continually expanded to provide a convenient and up to date community resource.},

Until recently, most studies have used dynamical tracers in the inner regions of the halo, relying on extrapolations to estimate the mass of the Milky Way. In this paper, we extend the hierarchical Bayesian model applied in Eadie \& Juri to study the mass distribution of the Milky Way halo; the new model allows for the use of all available 6D phase-space measurements. We use kinematic data of halo stars out to 142 kpc, obtained from the H3 survey and Gaia EDR3, to infer the mass of the Galaxy. Inference is carried out with the No-U-Turn sampler, a fast and scalable extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We report a median mass enclosed within 100 kpc of (68\% Bayesian credible interval), or a virial mass of , in good agreement with other recent estimates. We analyze our results using posterior predictive checks and find limitations in the model’s ability to describe the data. In particular, we find sensitivity with respect to substructure in the halo, which limits the precision of our mass estimates to ∼15\%.},

	abstract = {M31 has a giant stream of stars extending far to the south and a great deal of other tidal debris in its halo, much of which is thought to be directly associated with the southern stream. We model this structure by means of Bayesian sampling of parameter space, where each sample uses an N-body simulation of a satellite disrupting in M31's potential. We combine constraints on stellar surface densities from the Isaac Newton Telescope survey of M31 with kinematic data and photometric distances. This combination of data tightly constrains the model, indicating a stellar mass at last pericentric passage of log10 (Ms/M⊙) = 9.5 ± 0.1, comparable to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Any existing remnant of the satellite is expected to lie in the Northeast (NE) Shelf region beside M31's disc, at velocities more negative than M31's disc in this region. This rules out the prominent satellites M32 or NGC 205 as the progenitor, but an overdensity recently discovered in M31's NE disc sits at the edge of the progenitor locations found in the model. M31's virial mass is constrained in this model to be log10 M200 = 12.3 ± 0.1, alleviating the previous tension between observational virial mass estimates and expectations from the general galactic population and the timing argument. The techniques used in this paper, which should be more generally applicable, are a powerful method of extracting physical inferences from observational data on tidal debris structures.},

Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

Here, we assess these results by measuring the stellar kinematics on a sample of 315 galaxies, without a morphological selection, using 2D integral field data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. A proxy for the spin parameter (\${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{R\_e\}\$) and ellipticity (\${\textbackslash}epsilon\_e\$) are used to separate fast and slow rotators; there exists a good correspondence to regular and non-regular rotators, respectively, as also seen in earlier studies. We confirm that regular rotators show a strong h3 versus \$V/{\textbackslash}sigma\$ anti-correlation, whereas quasi-regular and non-regular rotators show a more vertical relation in h3 and \$V/{\textbackslash}sigma\$. Motivated by recent cosmological simulations, we develop an alternative approach to kinematically classify galaxies from their individual h3 versus \$V/{\textbackslash}sigma\$ signatures. We identify five classes of high-order stellar kinematic signatures using Gaussian mixture models. Class 1 corresponds to slow rotators, whereas Classes 2-5 correspond to fast rotators. We find that galaxies with similar \${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{R\_e\}-{\textbackslash}epsilon\_e\$ values can show distinctly different h3-\$V/{\textbackslash}sigma\$ signatures. Class 5 objects are previously unidentified fast rotators that show a weak h3 versus \$V/{\textbackslash}sigma\$ anti-correlation. These objects are predicted to be disk-less galaxies formed by gas-poor mergers. From morphological examination, however, there is evidence for large stellar disks. Instead, Class 5 objects are more likely disturbed galaxies, have counter-rotating bulges, or bars in edge-on galaxies. Finally, we interpret the strong anti-correlation in h3 versus \$V/{\textbackslash}sigma\$ as evidence for disks in most fast rotators, suggesting a dearth of gas-poor mergers among fast rotators.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting structural properties of dark matter halos is one of the fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the new suite of MultiDark cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. The MultiDark simulations cover a large range of masses 1e10-1e15Msun and volumes upto 50Gpc**3. The total number of dark matter halos in all the simulations exceeds 60 billion. We find that in order to understand the structure of dark matter halos and to make {\textasciitilde}1\% accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo concentration is more complex than the traditional ratio of the virial radius to the core radius in the NFW profile. For massive halos the averge density profile is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the core radius and the shape parameter alpha in the Einasto approximation. Combining results from different redshifts, masses and cosmologies, we show that halos progress through three stages of evolution. (1) They start as rare density peaks that experience very fast and nearly radial infall. This radial infall brings mass closer to the center producing a high concentrated halo. Here, the halo concentration increases with the increasing halo mass and the concentration is defined by the alpha parameter with nearly constant core radius. Later halos slide into (2) the plateau regime where the accretion becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region. Now the concentration does not depend on halo mass. (3) Once the rate of accretion slows down, halos move into the domain of declining concentration-mass relation because new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the core radius is staying constant. We provide accurate analytical fits to the numerical results for halo density profiles and concentrations.},

We calculate the X-ray properties in a manner consistent with observational techniques, demonstrating the bias and scatter introduced by using estimated masses. We find the total stellar content and black hole masses of the clusters to be in good agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters are too gas rich, suggesting that the AGN feedback model is not efficient enough at expelling gas from the high-redshift progenitors of the clusters. The X-ray properties, such as the spectroscopic temperature and the soft-band luminosity, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich properties are in reasonable agreement with the observed relations. However, the clusters have too high central temperatures and larger-than-observed entropy cores, which is likely driven by the AGN feedback after the cluster core has formed.

Here we describe a novel method of directly calculating the force on N bodies that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes are: accurate local interactions; freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions; and applicability to a wide class of systems, including (proto-)planetary, stellar, galactic and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error. Although we concentrate here on stellar dynamical applications, our techniques of efficiently handling a large number of long-range interactions and concentrating computational effort where most needed have potential applications in other areas of astrophysics as well.},

	abstract = {Intracluster light is thought to originate from stars that were ripped away from their parent galaxies by gravitational tides and galaxy interactions during the build up of the cluster. The stars from such interactions will accumulate over time, so semi-analytic models suggest that the abundance of intracluster stars is negligible in young proto-clusters at z{\textasciitilde}2 and grows to around a quarter of the stellar mass in the oldest, most mature clusters. In contrast to these theoretical expectations, we report on the detection of intracluster light within two proto-clusters at z=2 using deep HST images. We use the colour of the intracluster light to estimate its mass-to-light ratio in annuli around the brightest cluster galaxies (BCG), up to a radius of 100 kpc. We find that \$54{\textbackslash}pm5\${\textbackslash}\% and \$71{\textbackslash}pm3\${\textbackslash}\% of the stellar mass in these regions is located more than 10 kpc away from the BCGs in the two proto-clusters. This low concentration is similar to BCGs in lower redshift clusters, and distinct from other massive proto-cluster galaxies. This suggests that intracluster stars are already present within the core 100 kpc of proto-clusters. We compare these observations to the Hydrangea hydrodynamical galaxy cluster simulations and find that intracluster stars are predicted to be a generic feature of group-sized halos at z=2. These intracluster stars will gradually move further away from the BCG as the proto-cluster assembles into a cluster.},

	abstract = {We examine the origin of the mass discrepancy--radial acceleration relation (MDAR) of disk galaxies. This is a tight empirical correlation between the disk centripetal acceleration and that expected from the baryonic component. The MDAR holds for most radii probed by disk kinematic tracers, regardless of galaxy mass or surface brightness. The relation has two characteristic accelerations; \$a\_0\$, above which all galaxies are baryon-dominated; and \$a\_\{{\textbackslash}rm min\}\$, an effective minimum aceleration probed by kinematic tracers in isolated galaxies. We use a simple model to show that these trends arise naturally in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM. This is because: (i) disk galaxies in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM form at the centre of dark matter haloes spanning a relatively narrow range of virial mass; (ii) cold dark matter halo acceleration profiles are self-similar and have a broad maximum at the centre, reaching values bracketed precisely by \$a\_\{{\textbackslash}rm min\}\$ and \$a\_0\$ in that mass range; and (iii) halo mass and galaxy size scale relatively tightly with the baryonic mass of a galaxy in any successful \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM galaxy formation model. Explaining the MDAR in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM does not require modifications to the cuspy inner mass profiles of dark haloes, although these may help to understand the detailed rotation curves of some dwarf galaxies and the origin of extreme outliers from the main relation. The MDAR is just a reflection of the self-similar nature of cold dark matter haloes and of the physical scales introduced by the galaxy formation process.},

We map dark matter halo mass to galaxy stellar mass using relationships from abundance matching, applied to the Bolshoi–Planck dissipationless  N-body simulation. We define SRHR ≡ re/Rh as the ratio of galaxy radius to halo virial radius, and SRHRλ ≡ re/(λRh) as the ratio of galaxy radius to halo spin parameter times halo radius. At z ∼ 0.1, we find an average value of SRHR ≃ 0.018 and SRHRλ ≃ 0.5 with very little dependence on stellar mass. Stellar radius–halo radius (SRHR) and SRHRλ have a weak dependence on cosmic time since z ∼ 3. SRHR shows a mild decrease over cosmic time for low-mass galaxies, but increases slightly or does not evolve for more massive galaxies. We find hints that at high redshift (z ∼ 2–3), SRHRλ is lower for more massive galaxies, while it shows no significant dependence on stellar mass at z ≲ 0.5. We find that for both the GAMA and CANDELS samples, at all redshifts from z ∼ 0.1–3, the observed conditional size distribution in stellar mass bins is remarkably similar to the conditional distribution of λRh. We discuss the physical interpretation and implications of these results.},

The comparison is made for a large number of clusters at a range of redshifts in three different cosmological models (cold plus hot dark matter, cold dark matter, and open cold dark matter). We find that the analytic formulae provide a good description of the relations between three of the four numerical quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a procedure to correct for the fixed numerical resolution. We also compute the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement. The Press-Schechter prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the effect of metallicity with a fixed passband, and the structure of the halos. All of this is done in order to establish a firm groundwork for the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models are briefly discussed.},

We present a series of fitting formulae that accurately describe the time evolution of the concentration–mass (cvir–Mvir) relation since z= 2. Using arguments based on the spherical collapse model, we study the behaviour of the scalelength of the density profile during the assembly history of haloes, obtaining physical insights into the origin of the observed time evolution of the cvir–Mvir relation. We also investigate the evolution with redshift of dark matter halo shape and its dependence on mass. Within the studied redshift range, the relation between the halo shape and mass can be well fitted by a redshift-dependent power law. Finally we show that although for z= 0 the spin parameter is practically mass independent, at increasing redshift it shows an increasing correlation with mass.},

We confirm that, at fixed redshift and stellar mass over the range of , star-forming galaxies are on average larger than quiescent galaxies. The large sample of galaxies with accurate size measurements, thanks to the excellent imaging quality, also enables us to demonstrate that the R e –M * relations of both populations have a form of a broken power law, with a clear change of slopes at a pivot stellar mass M p . For quiescent galaxies, below an (evolving) pivot mass of , the relation follows ; above M p the relation is steeper and follows . For star-forming galaxies, below the relation follows ; above M p the relation evolves with redshift and follows . The shallow power-law slope for quiescent galaxies below M p indicates that large low-mass quiescent galaxies have sizes similar to those of their counterpart star-forming galaxies. We take this as evidence that large low-mass quiescent galaxies have been recently quenched (presumably through environment-specific processes) without significant structural transformation. Interestingly, the pivot stellar mass of the R e –M * relations for both populations also coincides with the mass at which half of the galaxy population is quiescent, implying that the pivot mass represents the transition of galaxy growth from being dominated by in situ star formation to being dominated by (dry) mergers.},

The ICL fraction is calculated in three optical filters using the CHEFs ICL estimator, a robust and accurate algorithm free of a priori assumptions. We find that the ICL fraction in the three bands is, on average, higher for the merging clusters, ranging between ∼7\% and 23\%, compared with the ∼2\%–11\% found for the relaxed systems. We observe a nearly constant value (within the error bars) in the ICL fraction of the regular clusters at the three wavelengths considered, which would indicate that the colors of the ICL and the cluster galaxies are, on average, coincident and, thus, so are their stellar populations. However, we find a higher ICL fraction in the F606W filter for the merging clusters, consistent with an excess of lower-metallicity/younger stars in the ICL, which could have migrated violently from the outskirts of the infalling galaxies during the merger event.},

We derive robust photometric stellar masses for a sample of brightest central galaxies (BCGs) in SDSS redmapper clusters at 0.17 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.3, and split the clusters into two equal-halo mass subsamples by their BCG stellar mass \$M\_*{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BCG\}\}\$. The weak lensing profiles ΔΣ of the two cluster subsamples exhibit different slopes on scales below \$1{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\}\$. To interpret such discrepancy, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian modelling of the two ΔΣ profiles by including different levels of miscentring effects between the two subsamples as informed by X-ray observations. We find that the two subsamples have the same average halo mass of \$1.74{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}{\textbackslash}, h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, but the concentration of the low-\$M\_*{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BCG\}\}\$ clusters is \$5.87\_\{-0.60\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.77\}\$, ∼1.5σ smaller than that of their high-\$M\_*{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BCG\}\}\$ counterparts (\$6.95\_\{-0.66\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.78\}\$). Furthermore, both cluster weak lensing and cluster-galaxy cross-correlations indicate that the large-scale bias of the low-\$M\_*{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BCG\}\}\$, low-concentration clusters are \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}10\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ higher than that of the high-\$M\_*{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BCG\}\}\$, high-concentration systems, hence possible evidence of the cluster assembly bias effect.

We extend earlier work on the relation between halo mass profiles and assembly histories to show how the latter may be used to predict concentrations for haloes of all masses and at any redshift. Our results clarify the link between concentration and the ‘collapse redshift’ of a halo as well as why concentration depends on mass and redshift solely through the dimensionless ‘peak height’ mass parameter, ν(M, z) = δcrit(z)/σ(M, z). We combine these results with analytic mass accretion histories to extrapolate the c(M, z) relations to mass regimes difficult to reach through direct simulation. Our model predicts that, at given z, c(M) should deviate systematically from a simple power law at high masses, where concentrations approach a constant value, and at low masses, where concentrations are substantially lower than expected from extrapolating published empirical fits. This correction may reduce the expected self-annihilation boost factor from substructure by about one order of magnitude. The model also reproduces the c(M, z) dependence on cosmological parameters reported in earlier work and thus provides a simple and robust account of the relation between cosmology and the mass–concentration–redshift relation of CDM haloes.},

Our simulations include standard \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$-cold dark matter (CDM) models, and additional runs with truncated power spectra, consistent with a thermal warm dark matter (WDM) scenario. We find that the mass profiles of CDM and WDM halos are self-similar and well approximated by the Einasto profile. The \$c(\{{\textbackslash}rm M\},z)\$ relation of CDM halos is monotonic: concentrations decrease with increasing virial mass at fixed redshift, and decrease with increasing redshift at fixed mass. The mass accretion histories (MAHs) of CDM halos are also scale-free, and can be used to infer concentrations directly. These results do not apply to WDM halos: their MAHs are not scale-free because of the characteristic scale imposed by the power-spectrum suppression. Further, the WDM \$c(\{{\textbackslash}rm M\},z)\$ relation is non-monotonic: concentrations peak at a mass scale dictated by the truncation scale, and decrease at higher and lower masses. We show that the assembly history of a halo can still be used to infer its concentration, provided that the total mass of its progenitors is considered (the "collapsed mass history"; CMH), rather than just that of its main ancestor. This exploits the scale-free nature of CMHs to derive a simple scaling that reproduces the mass-concentration-redshift relation of both CDM and WDM halos over a vast range of halo masses and redshifts. Our model therefore provides a robust account of the mass, redshift, cosmology and power spectrum dependence of dark matter halo concentrations.},

	abstract = {Radiative cooling is central to a wide range of astrophysical problems. Despite its importance, cooling rates are generally computed using very restrictive assumptions, such as collisional ionization equilibrium and solar relative abundances. We simultaneously relax both assumptions and investigate the effects of photoionization of heavy elements by the metagalactic ultraviolet (UV)/X-ray background and of variations in relative abundances on the cooling rates of optically thin gas in ionization equilibrium. We find that photoionization by the metagalactic background radiation reduces the net cooling rates by up to an order of magnitude for gas densities and temperatures typical of the shock-heated intergalactic medium and proto-galaxies (104K {\textless}{\textasciitilde} T {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 106K,ρ/{\textless}ρ{\textgreater} {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 100). In addition, photoionization changes the relative contributions of different elements to the cooling rates. We conclude that photoionization by both the ionizing background and heavy elements needs to be taken into account in order for the cooling rates to be correct to an order of magnitude. Moreover, if the rates need to be known to better than a factor of a few, then departures of the relative abundances from solar need to be taken into account. We propose a method to compute cooling rates on an element-by-element basis by interpolating pre-computed tables that take photoionization into account.

	abstract = {(Abridged) We present an implementation of stellar evolution and chemical feedback for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. We consider the timed release of individual elements by both massive (Type II supernovae and stellar winds) and intermediate mass stars (Type Ia supernovae and asymptotic giant branch stars). We illustrate the results of our method using a suite of cosmological simulations that include new prescriptions for radiative cooling, star formation, and galactic winds. Radiative cooling is implemented element-by-element, in the presence of an ionizing radiation background, and we track all 11 elements that contribute significantly to the radiative cooling. We contrast two reasonable definitions of the metallicity of a resolution element and find that while they agree for high metallicities, there are large differences at low metallicities. We argue the discrepancy is indicative of the lack of metal mixing caused by the fact that metals are stuck to particles. We argue that since this is a (numerical) sampling problem, solving it using a poorly constrained physical process such as diffusion could have undesired consequences. We demonstrate that the two metallicity definitions result in redshift z = 0 stellar masses that can differ by up to a factor of two, because of the sensitivity of the cooling rates to the elemental abundances. We find that by z = 0 most of the metals are locked up in stars. The gaseous metals are distributed over a very wide range of gas densities and temperatures. The shock-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium has a relatively high metallicity of {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}-1 Z\_sun that evolves only weakly and is therefore an important reservoir of metals.},

	abstract = {Cosmological simulations make use of sub-grid recipes for the implementation of galactic winds driven by massive stars because direct injection of supernova energy in thermal form leads to strong radiative losses, rendering the feedback inefficient. We argue that the main cause of the catastrophic cooling is a mismatch between the mass of the gas in which the energy is injected and the mass of the parent stellar population. Because too much mass is heated, the temperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic arguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical resolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected thermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose and test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum temperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both particle-based and grid-based codes. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in dark matter haloes with total mass 1010 and 1012 h-1 M⊙. The thermal feedback strongly suppresses the star formation rate and can drive massive, large-scale outflows without the need to turn off radiative cooling temporarily. In accordance with expectations derived from analytic arguments, for sufficiently high resolution the results become insensitive to the imposed temperature jump and also agree with high-resolution simulations employing kinetic feedback.},

	abstract = {Feedback from energy liberated by gas accretion on to black holes (BHs) is an attractive mechanism to explain the exponential cut-off at the massive end of the galaxy stellar mass function. Most previous implementations of BH accretion in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have assumed that BHs grow at an accretion rate that is proportion to the Bondi rate. A major concern is that the Bondi accretion rate is inappropriate when the accreting material has significant angular momentum. We present an improved accretion model that takes into account the circularization and subsequent viscous transport of infalling material, and implemented as a `subgrid' model in hydrodynamic simulations. The resulting accretion rates are generally low in low mass (≲ 1011.5 M⊙) haloes, but show outbursts of Eddington-limited accretion during galaxy mergers. During outbursts these objects strongly resemble quasars. In higher mass haloes, gas accretion peaks at ∼10 per cent of the Eddington rate, which is thought to be conducive to the formation of radio jets. The resulting accretion rate depends strongly on the effective pressure of the gas surrounding the BH, which in turn depends strongly on halo mass. This induces a sharp transition in the importance of BH feedback. In small haloes, the growth of galaxies is regulated by star formation and supernova feedback, but above a halo mass of 1011.5 M⊙, rapid BH growth leads to the suppression of star formation and reduced growth of stellar mass with increasing halo mass.},

Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a ‘cheat sheet’ of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis.},

Using archival data of the A85 cluster of galaxies taken with the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope, we show that using careful data processing can unveil the diffuse light within the cluster, the intracluster light. We reach surface brightness limits of (3σ, 10″ × 10″) = 30.9 and (3σ, 10″ × 10″) = 29.7 mag arcsec−2. We measured the radial surface brightness profiles of the brightest cluster galaxy out to the intracluster light (radius ∼215 kpc) for the g and i bands. We found that both the surface brightness and the color profiles become shallower beyond ∼75 kpc suggesting that a distinct component, the intracluster light, starts to dominate at that radius. The color of the profile at ∼100 kpc suggests that the buildup of the intracluster light of A85 occurs by the stripping of massive (∼1010 M ⊙) satellites. The measured fraction of this light ranges from 8\%–30\% in g, depending on the definition of intracluster light chosen.},

Chemo-dynamical studies of the stellar halo near the Sun have indicated the presence of multiple components3, such as streams4 and clumps5, as well as correlations between the stars' chemical abundances and orbital parameters6-8. Recently, analyses of two large stellar surveys9,10 revealed the presence of a well populated elemental abundance sequence7,11, two distinct sequences in the colour-magnitude diagram12 and a prominent, slightly retrograde kinematic structure13,14 in the halo near the Sun, which may trace an important accretion event experienced by the Galaxy15. However, the link between these observations and their implications for Galactic history is not well understood. Here we report an analysis of the kinematics, chemistry, age and spatial distribution of stars that are mainly linked to two major Galactic components: the thick disk and the stellar halo. We demonstrate that the inner halo is dominated by debris from an object that at infall was slightly more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud, and which we refer to as Gaia-Enceladus. The stars that originate in Gaia-Enceladus cover nearly the full sky, and their motions reveal the presence of streams and slightly retrograde and elongated trajectories. With an estimated mass ratio of four to one, the merger of the Milky Way with Gaia-Enceladus must have led to the dynamical heating of the precursor of the Galactic thick disk, thus contributing to the formation of this component approximately ten billion years ago. These findings are in line with the results of galaxy formation simulations, which predict that the inner stellar halo should be dominated by debris from only a few massive progenitors2,16.},

	abstract = {In cosmological simulations without baryons, the relation between the specific angular momentum \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ and mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ of galactic dark matter halos has the well-established form \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\} {\textbackslash}propto M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}{\textasciicircum}\{2/3\}\$. This is invariably adopted as the starting point in efforts to understand the analogous relation between the specific angular momentum \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$ and mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}\$ of the stellar parts of galaxies, which are often re-expressed relative to the corresponding halo properties through the retention fractions \$f\_j = j\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} / j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ and \$f\_M = M\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\} / M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$. An important caveat here is that the adopted \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\} {\textbackslash}propto M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}{\textasciicircum}\{2/3\}\$ relation could, in principle, be modified by the gravitational back-reaction of baryons on dark matter (DM). We have tested for this possibility by comparing the \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$-\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ relations in the IllustrisTNG100 and TNG50 simulations that include baryons (full-physics runs) with their counterparts that do not (DM-only runs). In all cases, we find scaling relations of the form \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\} {\textbackslash}propto M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, with \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}approx 2/3\$ over the ranges of mass and redshift studied here: \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\} {\textbackslash}geq 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \$0 {\textbackslash}leq z {\textbackslash}leq 2\$. The values of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ are virtually identical in the full-physics and DM-only runs at the same redshift. The only detectable effect of baryons on the \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$-\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm h\}\$ relation is a slightly higher normalization, by 12\%-15\% at \$z=0\$ and by 5\% at \$z=2\$. This implies that existing estimates of \$f\_j\$ based on DM-only simulations should be adjusted downward by similar amounts. Finally, we discuss briefly some implications of this work for studies of galaxy formation.},

This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today’s computing hardware. Here, we discuss recent methodological progress in the gadget code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in time-scales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle number density in the simulated volume. The gadget-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial condition generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

These simulations include radiative cooling but neglect star formation and feedback, leading most baryons to collect at the halo center in a disk which is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral. This unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effect that galaxies may have in transforming their dark halos. We find that the shape of the halo becomes more axisymmetric: halos are transformed from triaxial into essentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughly constant flattening (c/a {\textasciitilde} 0.85). Halos always contract as a result of galaxy assembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the "adiabatic contraction" hypothesis. The reduced contraction helps to reconcile LambdaCDM halos with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solar circle and should alleviate the long-standing difficulty of matching simultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy disks and the luminosity function. The halo contraction is also less pronounced than found in earlier simulations, a disagreement that suggests that halo contraction is not solely a function of the initial and final distribution of baryons. Not only how much baryonic mass has been deposited at the center of a halo matters, but also the mode of its deposition. It might prove impossible to predict the halo response without a detailed understanding of a galaxy's assembly history. (Abriged)},

	abstract = {The Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GS/E) structure is an accretion remnant in the Milky Way's halo that constitutes a large fraction of the nearby stellar halo. We study GS/E using high-purity samples of kinematically selected stars from APOGEE DR16 and Gaia. Employing a novel modelling framework to account for kinematic selection biases using distribution functions, we fit density profiles to these GS/E samples and measure their masses. We find that GS/E is described by a shallow density profile in the inner Galaxy, with a break between 15-25 kpc beyond which the profile becomes very steep in the outer Galaxy. We also find that GS/E is triaxial, with axis ratios 1:0.55:0.45 (nearly prolate), and the major axis is oriented about 80{\textasciitilde}degrees from the Sun-Galactic center line and 16 degrees above the plane. We measure a stellar mass for GS/E of \$1.45 {\textasciicircum}\{+0.92\}\_\{-0.51\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{(stat.)\}{\textbackslash},{\textasciicircum}\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.49\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{(sys.)\}{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, which is lower than previously estimated. We also fit a density profile to the entire Milky Way stellar halo, finding a mass in the range of \$6-8 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{8\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, and implying that GS/E could make up as little as 10-20 per cent of the mass of the Milky Way stellar halo. Our findings challenge recent works, which have found greater masses for GS/E, and often find that it dominates the mass budget of the stellar halo. Our lower stellar mass combined with standard stellar-mass-to-halo-mass relations implies that GS/E constituted a minor 1:8-mass-ratio merger at the time of its accretion.},

To ensure the simulations are sufficiently realistic for studies of large-scale structure, the subgrid prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback are calibrated to the observed low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function and cluster gas fractions. The calibration is performed using machine learning, separately for three resolutions. This approach enables specification of the model by the observables to which they are calibrated. The calibration accounts for a number of potential observational biases and for random errors in the observed stellar masses.

The remaining 4 variations use the unmodified calibration data but different cosmologies, including different neutrino masses.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05753},
	abstract = {We use two cosmological simulations to study the impact of spurious heating of stellar motions within simulated galaxies by dark matter (DM) particles. The simulations share the same numerical and subgrid parameters, but one used a factor of 7 more DM particles. We find that many galaxy properties are unaffected by spurious heating, including their masses, star formation histories, and the spatial distribution of their gaseous baryons. The distribution and kinematics of their stellar and DM particles, however, are affected. Below a resolution-dependent virial mass, \$M\_\{200\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm spur\}\$, galaxies have higher characteristic velocities, larger sizes, and more angular momentum in the simulation with lower DM mass resolution; haloes have higher central densities and lower velocity dispersions. Above \$M\_\{200\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm spur\}\$, galaxies and haloes have similar properties in both runs. The differences arise due to spurious heating, which transfers energy from DM to stellar particles, causing galaxies to heat up and haloes to cool down. The value of \$M\_\{200\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm spur\}\$ can be derived from an empirical disc heating model, and coincides with the mass below which the predicted \$spurious\$ velocity dispersion exceeds the \$measured\$ velocity dispersion of the simulated galaxies. We predict that galaxies in the \$100{\textasciicircum}3{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}3\$ EAGLE run and IllustrisTNG-100 are robust to spurious collisional effects at their half-mass radii provided their halo mass exceeds \$M\_\{200\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm spur\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{11.7\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$; for the \$25{\textasciicircum}3{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}3\$ EAGLE run and IllustrisTNG-50, we predict \$M\_\{200\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm spur\}{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Suppressing spurious heating at smaller/larger radii, or for older/younger stellar populations, requires haloes to be resolved with more/fewer DM particles.},

Paired haloes tend to reside in a more isotropic environment than isolated haloes, the shear tensor of their large-scale tidal field is possibly responsible for this difference. We also study the thickness of the spatial distribution of the top 11 most massive satellite galaxies obtained in the semi-analytic galaxy sample constructed from the Millennium II simulation. Moreover, satellites that have lost their host subhaloes due to the resolution limit of the simulation have been taken into account. As a result, we find that the difference in the distribution of the satellite thickness between isolated and paired haloes is indistinguishable, which suggests that the paired configuration is not responsible for the observed plane of satellites in the Milky Way. The results in this study indicate the paired configuration could bring some nonnegligible effect on the subhalo abundance in the investigation of the Milky Way's satellite problems.},

	abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation series to study how the dynamical state of dark matter halos affects the relation between mass and concentration. We find that a large fraction of massive systems are identified when they are substantially out of equilibrium and in a particular phase of their dynamical evolution: the more massive the halo, the more likely it is found at a transient stage of high concentration. This state reflects the recent assembly of massive halos and corresponds to the first pericentric passage of recently-accreted material when, before virialization, the kinetic and potential energies reach maximum and minimum values, respectively. This result explains the puzzling upturn in the mass-concentration relation reported in recent work for massive halos; indeed, the upturn disappears when only dynamically-relaxed systems are considered in the analysis. Our results warn against applying simple equilibrium models to describe the structure of rare, massive galaxy clusters and urges caution when extrapolating scaling laws calibrated on lower-mass systems, where such deviations from equilibrium are less common. The evolving dynamical state of galaxy clusters ought to be carefully taken into account if cluster studies are to provide precise cosmological constraints.},

We use machine learning to calibrate the AGN and stellar feedback models for the FLAMINGO cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Using Gaussian process emulators trained on Latin hypercubes of 32 smaller-volume simulations, we model how the galaxy stellar mass function and cluster gas fractions change as a function of the subgrid parameters.

We apply our method to the three different FLAMINGO resolutions, spanning a factor of 64 in particle mass, recovering the observed relations within the respective resolved mass ranges. We also use the emulators, which link changes in subgrid parameters to changes in observables, to find models that skirt or exceed the observationally allowed range for cluster gas fractions and the stellar mass function. Our method enables us to define model variations in terms of the data that they are calibrated to rather than the values of specific subgrid parameters.

            We use a sample of z = 0 galaxies visually classified as slow rotators (SRs) in the eagle hydrodynamical simulations to explore the effect of galaxy mergers on their formation, characterize their intrinsic galaxy properties, and study the connection between quenching and kinematic transformation. SRs that have had major or minor mergers (mass ratios ≥0.3 and 0.1−0.3, respectively) tend to have a higher triaxiality parameter and ex-situ stellar fractions than those that had exclusively very minor mergers or formed in the absence of mergers (‘no-merger’ SRs). No-merger SRs are more compact, have lower black hole-to-stellar mass ratios and quenched later than other SRs, leaving imprints on their z = 0 chemical composition. For the vast majority of SRs we find that quenching, driven by active galactic nuclei feedback, precedes kinematic transformation, except for satellite SRs, in which these processes happen in tandem. However, in ≈50 per cent of these satellites, satellite–satellite mergers are responsible for their SR fate, while environment (i.e. tidal field and interactions with the central) can account for the transformation in the rest. By splitting SRs into kinematic sub-classes, we find that flat SRs prefer major mergers; round SRs prefer minor or very minor mergers; prolate SRs prefer gas-poor mergers. Flat and prolate SRs are more common among satellites hosted by massive haloes (\${\textbackslash}gt 10{\textasciicircum}\{13.6\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) and centrals of high masses (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star \} {\textbackslash}gt 10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$). Although eagle galaxies display kinematic properties that broadly agree with observations, there are areas of disagreement, such as inverted stellar age and velocity dispersion profiles. We discuss these and how upcoming simulations can solve them.},

We find that j of the stars, jstars, and baryons, jbar, are strongly correlated with stellar and baryon mass, respectively, with the scatter being highly correlated with morphological proxies such as gas fraction, stellar concentration, (u-r) intrinsic colour, stellar age and the ratio of circular velocity to velocity dispersion. We compare with available observations at z = 0 and find excellent agreement. We find that jbar follows the theoretical expectation of an isothermal collapsing halo under conservation of specific angular momentum to within ≈50 per cent, while the subsample of rotation-supported galaxies are equally well described by a simple model in which the disc angular momentum is just enough to maintain marginally stable discs. We extracted evolutionary tracks of the stellar spin parameter of EAGLE galaxies and found that the fate of their jstars at z = 0 depends sensitively on their star formation and merger histories. From these tracks, we identified two distinct physical channels behind low jstars galaxies at z = 0: (I) galaxy mergers, and (II) early star formation quenching. The latter can produce galaxies with low jstars and early-type morphologies even in the absence of mergers.},

	abstract = {When averaged over large scales, star formation in galaxies is observed to follow the empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law for surface densities above a constant threshold. While the observed law involves surface densities, theoretical models and simulations generally work with volume density laws (i.e. Schmidt laws). We derive analytic relations between star formation laws expressed in terms of surface densities, volume densities, and pressures and we show how these relations depend on parameters such as the effective equation of state of the multiphase interstellar medium. Our analytic relations enable us to implement observed surface density laws into simulations. Because the parameters of our prescription for star formation are observables, we are not free to tune them to match the observations. We test our theoretical framework using high-resolution simulations of isolated disc galaxies that assume an effective equation of state for the multiphase interstellar medium. We are able to reproduce the star formation threshold and both the slope and the normalization of arbitrary input KS laws without tuning any parameters and with very little scatter, even for unstable galaxies and even if we use poor numerical resolution. Moreover, we can do so for arbitrary effective equations of state. Our prescription therefore enables simulations of galaxies to bypass our current inability to simulate the formation of stars. On the other hand, the fact that we can reproduce arbitrary input thresholds and KS laws, rather than just the particular ones picked out by nature, indicates that simulations that lack the physics and/or resolution to simulate the multiphase interstellar medium can only provide limited insight into the origin of the observed star formation laws.},

	abstract = {We use a sample of z = 0 galaxies visually classified as slow rotators (SRs) in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulations to explore the effect of galaxy mergers on their formation, characterize their intrinsic galaxy properties, and study the connection between quenching and kinematic transformation. SRs that have had major or minor mergers (mass ratios ≥0.3 and 0.1-0.3, respectively) tend to have a higher triaxiality parameter and ex-situ stellar fractions than those that had exclusively very minor mergers or formed in the absence of mergers ('no-merger' SRs). No-merger SRs are more compact, have lower black hole-to-stellar mass ratios and quenched later than other SRs, leaving imprints on their z = 0 chemical composition. For the vast majority of SRs we find that quenching, driven by active galactic nuclei feedback, precedes kinematic transformation, except for satellite SRs, in which these processes happen in tandem. However, in ≈50 per cent of these satellites, satellite-satellite mergers are responsible for their SR fate, while environment (i.e. tidal field and interactions with the central) can account for the transformation in the rest. By splitting SRs into kinematic sub-classes, we find that flat SRs prefer major mergers; round SRs prefer minor or very minor mergers; prolate SRs prefer gas-poor mergers. Flat and prolate SRs are more common among satellites hosted by massive haloes (\$ 10{\textasciicircum}\{13.6\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) and centrals of high masses (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}  10{\textasciicircum}\{10.5\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$). Although EAGLE galaxies display kinematic properties that broadly agree with observations, there are areas of disagreement, such as inverted stellar age and velocity dispersion profiles. We discuss these and how upcoming simulations can solve them.},

As they fall into the cluster, the stars in some of these galaxies are stripped from their hosts, and form the ICL. We consider the separate contributions to the ICL from stars that originate in the haloes and the discs of the galaxies. We find that disc ICL stars are more centrally concentrated than halo ICL stars. The majority of the disc ICL stars are associated with one initially disc-dominated galaxy that falls to the centre of the cluster and is heavily disrupted, producing part of the cD galaxy. At radial distances greater than 200 kpc, well beyond the stellar envelope of the cD galaxy, stars formerly from the stellar haloes of galaxies dominate the ICL. Therefore at large distances, the ICL population is dominated by older stars.},

	abstract = {We take advantage of a semianalytic model with a state-of-art implementation of the formation of the intracluster light (ICL) to study the mass distribution of the ICL in galaxy groups and clusters, at different redshifts. We assume the ICL to follow a Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile with a different concentration, linked to that of the dark matter by the relation cICL = γ cDM, where the parameter γ is set to reproduce the observed relation between the stellar mass in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and ICL in the innermost 100 kpc and the halo mass (M*100 − M500) at z = 0. The model is then tested against several theoretical and observational results, from the present time to z ∼ 1.5. Our analysis shows that the fraction of stellar mass in the BCG and ICL within the innermost 100 kpc is an increasing function of redshift, parameter γ, and a decreasing function of the halo mass. The value of γ required to match the observed M*100 − M500 is γ = 3 at z = 0, but there are indications that it might be a function of redshift and halo mass. This result indicates that the distribution of the ICL is more concentrated than the dark matter one, but less concentrated than previously found by other studies. We suggest that a modified version of the NFW is a good description of the distribution of the diffuse light in groups and clusters, which makes the ICL a reliable tracer of the dark matter, in good agreement with recent observational findings.},

We combine a parametric description of the star formation history with a closed-box evolution of metallicity where the present-day gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy is a free parameter. We show with this approach that we are able to recover the observationally determined cosmic star formation history (CSFH), an indication that stars are being formed in the correct epoch of the Universe, on average, for the manner in which we are conducting SED fitting. We also show the contribution to the CSFH of galaxies of different present-day visual morphologies, and stellar masses. Our analysis suggests that half of the mass in present-day elliptical galaxies was in place 11 Gyr ago. In other morphological types, the stellar mass formed later, up to 6 Gyr ago for present-day irregular galaxies. Similarly, the most massive galaxies in our sample were shown to have formed half their stellar mass by 11 Gyr ago, whereas the least massive galaxies reached this stage as late as 4 Gyr ago (the well-known effect of "galaxy downsizing"). Finally, our metallicity approach allows us to follow the average evolution in gas-phase metallicity for populations of galaxies, and extract the evolution of the cosmic metal mass density in stars and in gas, producing results in broad agreement with independent, higher-redshift observations of metal densities in the Universe.},

In addition, we present a compilation of ultraviolet, infrared and H α SFRFs and compare these with the predictions from the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the constraints implied by different indicators are inconsistent with each other for the highest star-forming objects at z \&lt; 2, a problem that is possibly related to selection biases and the uncertainties of dust attenuation effects. EAGLE's feedback parameters were calibrated to reproduce realistic galaxy sizes and stellar masses at z = 0.1. In this work we test if and why those choices yield realistic star formation rates (SFRs) for z ∼ 0–8 as well. We demonstrate that supernovae feedback plays a major role at setting the abundance of galaxies at all star-forming regimes, especially at high redshifts. On the contrary, active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback becomes more prominent at lower redshifts and is a major mechanism that affects only the highest star-forming systems. Furthermore, we find that galaxies with SFR ∼1–10 M⊙ yr−1 dominate the CSFRD at redshifts z ≤ 5, while rare high star-forming galaxies (SFR ∼10–100 M⊙ yr−1) contribute significantly only briefly around the peak era (z ∼ 2) and then are quenched by AGN feedback. In the absence of this prescription objects with SFR ∼10–100 M⊙ yr−1 would dominate the CSFRD, while the cosmic budget of star formation would be extremely high. Finally, we demonstrate that the majority of the cosmic star formation occurs in relatively rare high-mass haloes (MHalo ∼ 1011–13 M⊙) even at the earliest epochs.},

	abstract = {The clustering of dark haloes depends not only on their mass but also on their assembly history, a dependence we term ‘assembly bias’. Using a galaxy formation model grafted on to the Millennium Simulation of the ΛCDM cosmogony, we study how assembly bias affects galaxy clustering. We compare the original simulation to ‘shuffled’ versions where the galaxy populations are randomly swapped among haloes of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations between assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are ignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark matter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more realistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances two-point correlations by 10 per cent for galaxies with  brighter than −17, but suppresses them by a similar amount for galaxies brighter than −20. When such samples are split by colour, assembly bias is 5 per cent stronger for red galaxies and 5 per cent weaker for blue ones. Halo central galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of all types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central galaxies. Shuffling galaxies among haloes of fixed formation redshift or concentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much smaller than when mass alone is fixed. Assembly bias must reflect a correlation of environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of these parameters. It induces effects which could compromise precision measurements of cosmological parameters from large galaxy surveys.},

Most ICL luminosity increases come in short, discrete events which are highly correlated with group accretion events within the cluster. In evolved clusters we find that {\textasciitilde}10-15\% of the clusters' luminosity is at ICL surface brightness. The morphological structure of the ICL changes with time, evolving from a complex of filaments and small-scale, relatively high surface brightness features early in a cluster's history, to a more diffuse and amorphous cluster-scale ICL envelope at later times. Finally, we also see a correlation between the evolution of ICL at different surface brightnesses, including a time delay between the evolution of faint and extremely faint surface brightness features which is traced to the differing dynamical timescales in the group and cluster environment.},

We have implemented a friends-of-friends-type clustering algorithm which finds groups of particles correlated in both position and velocity space to identify substructures in the ICL, hereafter referred to as ``streams''. We find that {\textasciitilde}40\% of the cluster's ICL is generated in the form of these massive (M {\textgreater} 7.0x10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun), dynamically cold streams. The fraction of the ICL generated in streams is greater early in the cluster's evolution, when galaxies are interacting in the group environment, than later in its evolution when the massive cluster potential has been assembled. The production of streams requires the strong tidal fields associated with close interactions between pairs of galaxies, and is usually associated with merging pairs of galaxies, or fast, close encounters with the cluster's central galaxy. Once streams are formed, they begin to decay as they are disrupted by the tidal field of the cluster.

	abstract = {Using a suite of N-body simulations of galaxy clusters specifically tailored to study the intracluster light (ICL) component, we measure the quantity of ICL using a number of different methods previously employed in the literature for both observational and simulation data sets. By measuring the ICL of the clusters using multiple techniques, we identify systematic differences in how each detection method identifies the ICL. We find that techniques which define the ICL solely based on the current position of the cluster luminosity, such as a surface brightness or local density threshold, tend to find less ICL than methods utilizing time or velocity information, including stellar particles' density history or binding energy. The range of ICL fractions (the fraction of the clusters' total luminosity found in the ICL component) we measure at z=0 across all our clusters using any definition span the range from 9-36\%, and even within a single cluster different methods can change the measured ICL fraction by up to a factor of two. Separating the cluster's central galaxy from the surrounding ICL component is a challenge for all ICL techniques, and because the ICL is centrally concentrated within the cluster, the differences in the measured ICL quantity between techniques are largely a consequence of this central galaxy/ICL separation. We thoroughly explore the free parameters involved with each measurement method, and find that adjusting these parameters can change the measured ICL fraction by up to a factor of two. While for all definitions the quantity of ICL tends to increase with time, the ICL fraction does not grow at a uniform rate, nor even monotonically under some definitions. Thus, the ICL can be used as a rough indicator of dynamical age, where more dynamically advanced clusters will on average have higher ICL fractions.},

We find the transition radius to be independent of both BCG+ICL and halo masses, with an average of 60 ± 40 kpc, in good agreement with previous observational measurements, but given the large scatter it can be considered as a sort of physical separation between the two components only on a cluster scale. From the analysis of the M ICL-M BCG+ICL relation, we construct a method able to extract the ICL mass directly from knowledge of the BCG+ICL mass. Given the large scatter in low-mass systems, such a method under/overpredicts the true value of the ICL in a significant way, up to a factor of three in the worst cases. On the other hand, for \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BCG\}+{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ICL\}\} 12\$ or \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Halo\}\} 14\$ (where masses are in units of M ⊙), the difference between the true value and the one extracted from the M ICL-M BCG+ICL relation ranges between ±30\%. We therefore suggest this relation as a reliable test for observational works aiming to isolate the ICL from the BCG, for systems hosted by haloes on a cluster scale.},

	abstract = {We examine the outskirts of galaxy clusters in the C-EAGLE simulations to quantify the 'edges' of the stellar and dark matter distribution. The radius of the steepest slope in the dark matter, commonly used as a proxy for the splashback radius, is located at \${\textbackslash}sim {\textbackslash}, r\_\{200 {\textbackslash}rm m\}\$ ; the strength and location of this feature depends on the recent mass accretion rate, in good agreement with previous work. Interestingly, the stellar distribution (or intracluster light, ICL) also has a well-defined edge, which is directly related to the splashback radius of the halo. Thus, detecting the edge of the ICL can provide an independent measure of the physical boundary of the halo, and the recent mass accretion rate. We show that these caustics can also be seen in the projected density profiles, but care must be taken to account for the influence of substructures and other non-diffuse material, which can bias and/or weaken the signal of the steepest slope. This is particularly important for the stellar material, which has a higher fraction bound in subhaloes than the dark matter. Finally, we show that the 'stellar splashback' feature is located beyond current observational constraints on the ICL, but these large projected distances (≫1 Mpc) and low surface brightnesses (μ ≫ 32 mag arcsec-2) can be reached with upcoming observational facilities such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and Euclid.},

For example, the concept of stellar halos is generalized to weakly rotating structures that are composed of loosely bound stars, which can hence be associated to both disk and elliptical type morphologies. By applying this method to central galaxies with stellar mass 1010-11.5 M⊙ from the TNG50 simulation, we identify three broadly-defined types of galaxies: galaxies dominated by disk, by bulge, or by stellar halo structures. We then use the simulation to infer the underlying connection between the growth of structures and physical processes over cosmic time. By tracing galaxies back in time, we recognize three fundamental regimes: an early phase of evolution (z ≳ 2), and internal and external (mainly mergers) processes that act at later times. We find that disk- and bulge-dominated galaxies are not significantly affected by mergers since z {\textasciitilde} 2. The difference in their present-day structures originates from two distinct evolutionary pathways-extended versus compact-that are likely to be determined by their parent dark matter halos (i.e., nature). In contrast, slow rotator elliptical galaxies are typically halo-dominated, forming by external processes (e.g., mergers) in the later phase (i.e., nurture). This picture challenges the general idea that elliptical galaxies are the same objects as classical bulges. In observations, both bulge- and halo-dominated galaxies are likely to be classified as early-type galaxies with compact morphology and quiescent star formation. However, here we find them to have very different evolutionary histories.},

Employing careful treatment of potential systematic biases and using data at the largest radii to determine the background sky level, we reconstruct the surface brightness profile out to a radius of 2 Mpc. This radius is the largest to which the ICL has been measured for an individual cluster. Within this radius, we measure a total luminosity of 1.5 × 1013 L⊙ for the BCG plus ICL. From the profile and its logarithmic slope, we identify the transition from the BCG to ICL at r {\textasciitilde} 70 kpc. Remarkably, we also detect an apparent inflection in the profile centred in the 1.2-1.7 Mpc (0.37-0.52 r200m) radial bin, a signature of an infall caustic in the stellar distribution. Based upon the shape and strength of the feature, we interpret it as potentially being at the splashback radius, although the radius is smaller than theoretical predictions. If this is the splashback radius, then it is the first such detection in the ICL and the first detection of the splashback radius for an individual cluster. Similar analyses should be possible with the other Frontier Field clusters, and eventually with clusters observed by the Euclid and Roman missions.},

	abstract = {We use idealized N-body simulations of equilibrium stellar discs embedded within course-grained dark matter (DM) haloes to study the effects of spurious collisional heating on disc structure and kinematics. Collisional heating artificially increases the vertical and radial velocity dispersions of disc stars, as well as the thickness and size of discs; the effects are felt at all galacto-centric radii. The integrated effects of collisional heating are determined by the mass of DM halo particles (or equivalently, by the number of particles at fixed halo mass), their local density and characteristic velocity dispersion, but are largely insensitive to the stellar particle mass. The effects can therefore be reduced by increasing the mass resolution of DM in cosmological simulations, with limited benefits from increasing the baryonic (or stellar) mass resolution. We provide a simple empirical model that accurately captures the effects of spurious collisional heating on the structure and kinematics of simulated discs, and use it to assess the importance of disc heating for simulations of galaxy formation. We find that the majority of state-of-the-art zoom simulations, and a few of the highest-resolution, smallest-volume cosmological runs, are in principle able to resolve thin stellar discs in Milky Way-mass haloes, but most large-volume cosmological simulations cannot. For example, DM haloes resolved with fewer than ≈106 particles will collisionally heat stars near the stellar half-mass radius such that their vertical velocity dispersion increases by ≳ 10 per cent of the halo's virial velocity in approximately one Hubble time.},

Separating the BCG from the intracluster light (ICL) by means of a fixed 30 kpc aperture, we find that the fraction of stellar mass contributed by ex situ (i.e. accreted) stars at z = 0 is approximately 70, 80, and 90 per cent for the BCG, BCG + ICL, and ICL, respectively. Tracking our simulated BCGs back in time using the merger trees, we find that they became dominated by ex situ stars at z {\textasciitilde}1-2, and that half of the stars that are part of the BCG at z = 0 formed early (z {\textasciitilde} 3) in other galaxies, but 'assembled' onto the BCG until later times (z ≈ 0.8 for the whole sample, z ≈ 0.5 for BCGs in \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 200\}{\textbackslash}ge 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ haloes).

This progress has led to ground-breaking results in the field, such as pinpointing the origin of the ICL and its potential to map dark matter in clusters of galaxies. We now enter an era of deep and wide surveys that promise to uncover the faint Universe as never seen before, adding to our growing understanding of the properties of the ICL and, consequently, of the formation of the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. The goal of this Review is to summarize the most recent results on ICL, synthesizing the current knowledge in the field and providing a global perspective that may benefit future ICL studies.},

Here we present the first comprehensive study of the intracluster light (ICL) of the cluster SMACS J0723.3-7327 (z = 0.39) using the JWST Early Release Observations. These deep and high spatial resolution images allow the study of the ICL with a high signal-to-noise ratio up to a radial distance of {\textasciitilde}400 kpc, twice as far with respect to previous HST studies of intermediate-redshift clusters. This opens up the possibility of exploring the rich mixture of processes that are building the ICL. We find that the inner parts of this cluster (R {\textless} 100 kpc) are built through a major merger, while the outer parts (R {\textgreater} 100 kpc) are mainly produced by the tidal stripping of Milky Way-like satellites. We also find that the slope of the stellar mass density radial profile of the ICL of this cluster (α 3D = -2.47 ± 0.13) closely follows the predicted dark matter halo slope (α 3D,DM = -2.6 to -2), supporting the idea that both components have a similar shape and thus the potential of using the ICL as a tracer of the dark matter distribution in clusters of galaxies. Future JWST studies of the ICL are set to revolutionize our understanding of cluster formation and will be crucial to improve the gravitational lensing mass maps of these structures and thus accurately characterize the properties of the first galaxies.},

The richest clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse intracluster light. Haloes more massive than about 5 × 1014 M⊙ have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100 kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow as the dark matter's ( - 3.5 ≲ α3D ≲ -3). Total halo mass is a very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at z = 0, the 3D stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as ∝(M500c)0.49 with a ∼0.12 dex scatter. This is possibly too steep in comparison to the available observational constraints, even though the abundance of The Next Generation less-massive galaxies ( ≲ 1011 M⊙ in stars) is in good agreement with the measured galaxy stellar mass functions at recent epochs. The 3D sizes of massive galaxies fall too on a tight (∼0.16 dex scatter) power-law relation with halo mass, with r{\textasciicircum}stars\_0.5 ∝ (M\_200c){\textasciicircum}\{0.53\}. Even more fundamentally, halo mass alone is a good predictor for the whole stellar mass profiles beyond the inner few kiloparsecs, and we show how on average these can be precisely recovered given a single-mass measurement of the galaxy or its halo.},

We perform dark matter-only, zoomed simulations of two Milky Way-mass hosts and make targeted, controlled changes to their cosmological histories using the genetic modification technique. Populating each history's stellar halo with a semi-empirical, particle tagging approach then enables a controlled study, with all instances converging to the same large-scale structure, dynamical and stellar mass at z = 0 as their reference. These related merger scenarios alone generate an extended spread in stellar halo mass fractions (1.5 dex) comparable to the observed population, with the largest scatter achieved by growing late (z ≤ 1) major mergers that spread out existing stars to create massive, in-situ dominated stellar haloes. Increasing a last major merger at z {\textasciitilde} 2 brings more accreted stars into the inner regions, resulting in smaller scatter in the outskirts which are predominantly built by subsequent minor events. Exploiting the flexibility of our semi-empirical approach, we show that the diversity of stellar halo masses across scenarios is reduced by allowing shallower slopes in the stellar mass-halo mass relation for dwarf galaxies, while it remains conserved when central stars are born with hotter kinematics across cosmic time. The merger-dependent diversity of stellar haloes thus responds distinctly to assumptions in modelling the central and dwarf galaxies respectively, opening exciting prospects to constrain star formation and feedback at different galactic mass-scales with the coming generation of deep, photometric observatories.},

This combines the functionality of the recently released PROFOUND (for automatic source extraction), PROFIT (for extended source profiling), and PROSPECT (for stellar population modelling) software packages. The key novelty of PROFUSE is that it generates images using a self-consistent model for the star formation and metallicity history of the bulge and disc separately, and uses target images across a range of wavelengths to define the model likelihood and optimize our physical galaxy reconstruction. The first part of the paper explores the PROFUSE approach in detail, and compares results to published structural and stellar population properties. The latter part of the paper applies PROFUSE to 6664 z {\textless} 0.06 GAMA galaxies. Using re-processed ugriZYJHKs imaging we extract structural and stellar population properties for bulges and discs in parallel. As well as producing true stellar mass based mass-size relationships, we further extend this correlation to explore the third dimensions of age and gas phase metallicity. The discs in particular demonstrate strong co-dependency between mass-size-age in a well-defined plane, where at a given disc stellar mass younger discs tend to be larger. These findings are in broad agreement with work at higher redshift, suggesting discs that formed earlier are physically smaller.},

We show that the differentiation of blue star-forming and red quiescent galaxies using morphological diagnostics can be achieved with similar efficacy to the use of kinematical diagnostics, but only if one is able to measure both the flattening and the triaxiality of the galaxy. Flattened oblate galaxies exhibit greater rotational support than their spheroidal counterparts, but there is significant scatter in the relationship between morphological and kinematical diagnostics, such that kinematically similar galaxies can exhibit a broad range of morphologies. The scatter in the relationship between the flattening and the ratio of the rotation and dispersion velocities (v/σ) correlates strongly with the anisotropy of the stellar velocity dispersion: at fixed v/σ, flatter galaxies exhibit greater dispersion in the plane defined by the intermediate and major axes than along the minor axis, indicating that the morphology of simulated galaxies is influenced significantly by the structure of their velocity dispersion. The simulations reveal that this anisotropy correlates with the intrinsic morphology of the galaxy's inner dark matter halo, i.e. the halo's morphology that emerges in the absence of dissipative baryonic physics. This implies the existence of a causal relationship between the morphologies of galaxies and that of their host dark matter haloes.},

	abstract = {We present MORDOR (MORphological DecOmposeR), a new algorithm for structural decomposition of simulated galaxies based on stellar kinematics. The code measures the properties of up to five structural components (a thin/cold and a thick/warm disc, a classical and a secular bulge, and a spherical stellar halo), and determines the properties of a stellar bar (if present). A comparison with other algorithms presented in the literature yields overall good agreement, with MORDOR displaying a higher flexibility in correctly decomposing systems and identifying bars in crowded environments (e.g. with ongoing fly-bys, often observable in cosmological simulations). We use MORDOR to analyse galaxies in the TNG50 simulation and find the following: (i) the thick disc component undergoes the strongest evolution in the binding energy-circularity plane, as expected when disc galaxies decrease their turbulent-rotational support with cosmic time; (ii) smaller galaxies (with stellar mass, \$10{\textasciicircum}\{9\} {\textbackslash}lesssim M\_\{*\}/{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash}le 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$) undergo a major growth in their disc components after z {\textasciitilde} 1, whereas (iii) the most massive galaxies (\$5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}  M\_\{*\}/{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}{\textbackslash}le 5{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$) evolve towards more spheroidal dominated objects down to z = 0 due to frequent gravitational interactions with satellites; (iv) the fraction of barred galaxies grows rapidly at high redshift and stabilizes below z {\textasciitilde} 2, except for the most massive galaxies that show a decrease in the bar occupation fraction at low redshift; (v) galaxies with \$M\_\{*\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}{\textasciitilde}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ exhibit the highest relative occurrence of bars at z = 0, in agreement with observational studies.

	abstract = {We use simulated cluster member galaxies from Illustris TNG300-1 to develop a technique for measuring the galaxy cluster mass accretion rate (MAR) that can be applied directly to observations. We analyze 1318 IllustrisTNG clusters of galaxies with \$M\_\{200c\}{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$0.01{\textbackslash}leq z {\textbackslash}leq 1.04\$. The MAR we derive is the ratio between the mass of a spherical shell located in the infall region and the time for the infalling shell to accrete onto the cluster core. At fixed redshift, an \${\textbackslash}sim 1\$ order of magnitude increase in \$M\_\{200c\}\$ results in a comparable increase in MAR. At fixed mass, the MAR increases by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 5\$ from \$z=0.01\$ to \$z=1.04\$. The MAR estimates derived from the caustic technique are unbiased and lie within 20\% of the MAR's based on the true mass profiles. This agreement is crucial for observational derivation of the MAR. The IllustrisTNG results are also consistent with (i) previous merger tree approaches based on N-body dark matter only simulations and with (ii) previously determined MAR's of real clusters based on the caustic method. Future spectroscopic and photometric surveys will provide MAR's of enormous cluster samples with mass profiles derived from both spectroscopy and weak lensing. Combined with future larger volume hydrodynamical simulations that extend to higher redshift, the MAR promises important insights into evolution of massive systems of galaxies.},

	abstract = {We analyse the mass assembly of central galaxies in the Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) hydrodynamical simulations. We build merger trees to connect galaxies to their progenitors at different redshifts and characterize their assembly histories by focusing on the time when half of the galaxy stellar mass was assembled into the main progenitor. We show that galaxies with stellar mass M* \&lt; 1010.5 M⊙ assemble most of their stellar mass through star formation in the main progenitor (‘in situ’ star formation). This can be understood as a consequence of the steep rise in star formation efficiency with halo mass for these galaxies. For more massive galaxies, however, an increasing fraction of their stellar mass is formed outside the main progenitor and subsequently accreted. Consequently, while for low-mass galaxies, the assembly time is close to the stellar formation time, the stars in high-mass galaxies typically formed long before half of the present-day stellar mass was assembled into a single object, giving rise to the observed antihierarchical downsizing trend. In a typical present-day M* ≥ 1011 M⊙ galaxy, around 20 per cent of the stellar mass has an external origin. This fraction decreases with increasing redshift. Bearing in mind that mergers only make an important contribution to the stellar mass growth of massive galaxies, we find that the dominant contribution comes from mergers with galaxies of mass greater than one-tenth of the main progenitor's mass. The galaxy merger fraction derived from our simulations agrees with recent observational estimates.},

In several papers, we introduce our MillenniumTNG (MTNG) project that provides a comprehensive set of high-resolution, large volume simulations of cosmic structure formation aiming to better understand physical processes on large scales and to help interpreting upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys. We here focus on the full physics box MTNG740 that computes a volume of \$(740{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}){\textasciicircum}3\$ with a baryonic mass resolution of \$3.1{\textbackslash}times{\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ using {\textbackslash}textsc\{arepo\} with \$80.6\${\textasciitilde}billion cells and the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We verify that the galaxy properties produced by MTNG740 are consistent with the TNG simulations, including more recent observations. We focus on galaxy clusters and analyse cluster scaling relations and radial profiles. We show that both are broadly consistent with various observational constraints. We demonstrate that the SZ-signal on a deep lightcone is consistent with Planck limits. Finally, we compare MTNG740 clusters with galaxy clusters found in Planck and the SDSS-8 RedMaPPer richness catalogue in observational space, finding very good agreement as well. However, \{{\textbackslash}it simultaneously\} matching cluster masses, richness, and Compton-\$y\$ requires us to assume that the SZ mass estimates for Planck clusters are underestimated by \$0.2\${\textasciitilde}dex on average. Thanks to its unprecedented volume for a high-resolution hydrodynamical calculation, the MTNG740 simulation offers rich possibilities to study baryons in galaxies, galaxy clusters, and in large scale structure, and in particular their impact on upcoming large cosmological surveys.},

	abstract = {I use the abundance matching ansatz, which has proven to be successful in reproducing galaxy clustering and other statistics, to derive estimates of the virial radius, R 200, for galaxies of different morphological types and a wide range of stellar masses. I show that over eight orders of magnitude in stellar mass galaxies of all morphological types follow an approximately linear relation between half-mass radius of their stellar distribution, r 1/2, and virial radius, r 1/2 ≈ 0.015 R 200, with scatter of ≈0.2 dex. Such scaling is in remarkable agreement with the expectation of models that assume that galaxy sizes are controlled by halo angular momentum, r 1/2vpropλR 200, where λ is the spin of galaxy parent halo. The scatter about the relation is comparable with the scatter expected from the distribution of λ. Moreover, I show that when the stellar and gas surface density profiles of galaxies of different morphological types are rescaled by the radius rn = 0.015 R 200, the rescaled profiles follow approximately universal exponential (for late types) and de Vaucouleurs (for early types) form with scatter of only ≈30\%-50\% at R ≈ 1-3rn . Remarkably, both late- and early-type galaxies have similar mean stellar surface density profiles at R {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1rn . The main difference between their stellar distributions is thus at R {\textless} rn . The results of this study imply that galaxy sizes and radial distribution of baryons are shaped primarily by properties of their parent halos and that the sizes of both late-type disks and early-type spheroids are controlled by halo angular momentum.},

The algorithm has multiple attractive features: (1) it can iteratively self-train the red sequence model based on a minimal spectroscopic training sample, an important feature for high-redshift surveys. (2) It can handle complex masks with varying depth. (3) It produces cluster-appropriate random points to enable large-scale structure studies. (4) All clusters are assigned a full redshift probability distribution P(z). (5) Similarly, clusters can have multiple candidate central galaxies, each with corresponding centering probabilities. (6) The algorithm is parallel and numerically efficient: it can run a Dark Energy Survey-like catalog in ∼500 CPU hours. (7) The algorithm exhibits excellent photometric redshift performance, the richness estimates are tightly correlated with external mass proxies, and the completeness and purity of the corresponding catalogs are superb. We apply the redMaPPer algorithm to ∼10, 000 deg2 of SDSS DR8 data and present the resulting catalog of ∼25,000 clusters over the redshift range z ∈ [0.08, 0.55]. The redMaPPer photometric redshifts are nearly Gaussian, with a scatter σz ≈ 0.006 at z ≈ 0.1, increasing to σz ≈ 0.02 at z ≈ 0.5 due to increased photometric noise near the survey limit. The median value for {\textbar}Δz{\textbar}/(1 + z) for the full sample is 0.006. The incidence of projection effects is low (⩽5\%).

Our input galaxy models describe the stellar mass-halo mass relation, and the galaxy occupation fraction. The number of major and minor mergers depends on the type of dark matter; in particular, minor mergers are greatly suppressed in warm dark matter models. In addition, the number of mergers that bring in stars is strongly dependent on the galaxy occupation model. For example, minor mergers are negligible for stellar halo growth in models with a high mass threshold for galaxy formation (i.e. 10{\textasciicircum}9.3 M\_Sun at z=0). Moreover, this threshold for galaxy formation can also determine the relative difference (if any) between the stellar haloes of satellite and field dwarfs. Using isolated simulations of dwarf-dwarf mergers, we show that the relative frequency of major and minor mergers predict very different stellar haloes: Typically, "intermediate" dark matter merger ratios ({\textasciitilde}1:5) maximise the growth of distant stellar haloes. We discuss the observability of dwarf stellar haloes and find that the surface brightness of these features are incredibly faint. However, when several dwarfs are stacked together models that form particularly rich stellar haloes could be detectable. Finally, we show that stellar streams in the Galactic halo overlapping in phase-space with known dwarf satellites are likely remnants of their stripped stellar haloes. The mere existence of dwarf stellar haloes can already put constraints on some small-scale models, and thus observational probes should be a high priority.},

	abstract = {We show that discreteness effects related to classical two-body relaxation produce spurious heating of the gaseous component in numerical simulations of galaxy formation. A simple analytic calculation demonstrates that this artificial heating will dominate radiative cooling in any simulation where the mass of an individual dark matter particle exceeds a certain critical value. This maximum mass depends only on the cooling function of the gas, on the fraction of the material in gaseous form, and (weakly) on typical temperatures in the gas. It is comparable to, or smaller than, the dark matter particle masses employed in most published simulations of cosmological hydrodynamics and galaxy formation. Any simulation that violates this constraint will be unable to follow cooling flows, although catastrophic cooling of gas may still occur in regions with very short cooling times. We use a series of N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to explore this effect. In simulations that neglect radiative cooling, two-body heating causes a gradual expansion of the gas component. When radiative effects are included, we find that gas cooling is almost completely suppressed for dark matter particle masses above our limit. Although our test simulations use smoothed particle hydrodynamics, similar effects, and a similar critical mass, are expected in any simulation where the dark matter is represented by discrete particles.},

	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},
