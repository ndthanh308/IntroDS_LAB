  "abstract": "In this paper we investigate solutions to a linear Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the Wasserstein space of probability vectors on a finite simply connected graph. We prove that there exists a solution under the assumption that the initial value function $u_0:\\mathcal{P}(G)\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is Fréchet continuously differentiable.",
