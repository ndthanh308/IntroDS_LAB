In conclusion, we have presented a two-stage approach for conditional source separation with heterogeneous attributes. The first stage involves a completion module responsible for retrieving the missing attributes associated with the target source, given a partial condition vector and the input mixture. The second stage involves a separation module that takes as input the concatenation of the completed and original condition vectors as well as the input mixture and is trained to retrieve the target source. This proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art multi-condition separation method of heterogeneous condition training by leveraging the discriminative power of the different attributes associated with the target source. Our method could potentially enable users to complete their queries and obtain more accurate and informative separation results.
