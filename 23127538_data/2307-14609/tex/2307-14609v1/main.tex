\begin{abstract}
% Recent advances in audio tagging and conditional sound source separation have enabled the application of several neural network methods with outstanding performance. Despite this progress, only a limited number of studies have explored the usage of extraneous semantic concepts for conditionining the separation network. Specifically, heterogeneous condition training has provided fair separation performance for several discriminative concepts but it still lacked behind specialist single-condition models. In this paper, we leverage a source-aware classification model for audio mixtures which is able to discern and complete the missing attributes associated with a target sound waveform. In a later step, we use the pre-trained completion network to guide the conditional separation training process. Our experiments showcase that our attribute completion method and separation yields significantly higher performance than previous state-of-the-art conditional sound separation setups. Our method can also be viewed as an alternative training method to bridge the performance gap between a trained multi-conditional model and an oracle fully informed model by completing the partially missing query information.

Recent approaches in source separation leverage semantic information about their input mixtures and constituent sources that when used in conditional separation models can achieve impressive performance. Most approaches along these lines have focused on simple descriptions, which are not always useful for varying types of input mixtures. In this work, we present an approach in which a model, given an input mixture and partial semantic information about a target source, is trained to extract additional semantic data. We then leverage this pre-trained model to improve the separation performance of an uncoupled multi-conditional separation network. Our experiments demonstrate that the separation performance of this multi-conditional model is significantly improved, approaching the performance of an oracle model with complete semantic information. Furthermore, our approach achieves performance levels that are comparable to those of the best performing specialized single conditional models, thus providing an easier to use alternative.
