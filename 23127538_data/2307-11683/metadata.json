  "abstract": "The Ministry of Economy has an interest and demand in exploring how to increase the set of [legally registered] small family farmers in Ukraine and to examine more in details measures that could reduce the scale of the shadow agricultural market in Ukraine. Building upon the above political economy background and demand, we will be undertaking the analysis along the two separate but not totally independents streams of analysis, i.e. sustainable small scale (family) farming development and exploring the scale and measures for reducing the shadow agricultural market in Ukraine",
