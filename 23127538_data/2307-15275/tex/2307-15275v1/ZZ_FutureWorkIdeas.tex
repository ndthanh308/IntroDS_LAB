extension to nonzero D case for MIMO systems

Efficient algorithms to compute zeros of MIMO linear systems

the superset of invariant zeros can also be found from the values of s for which the rossenbrock matrix comming from the linear form of the Brunovsky normal realization drops rank

generalized eigenvalue problem
