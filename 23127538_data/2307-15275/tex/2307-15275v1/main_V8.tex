\section{INTRODUCTION}

Zeros are fundamental in the study of systems and control theory. 
While the poles affect the system stability, transients, and convergence rate, zeros affect the undershoot, overshoot, and zero crossings
\cite{macfarlane1976poles,desoer1974zeros,tokarzewski2006finite}.
Furthermore, nonminimum phase zeros, which are zeros in the open-right-half-plane, limit performance and bandwidth due to limited gain margin, exacerbate the tradeoff between the robustness and achievable performance of a feedback control system, and prevent input-output decoupling \cite{hoagg2007nonminimum,havre2001achievable,wonham1970decoupling}. 
Precise knowledge of zeros is thus crucial in the design of reliable control and estimation systems. 

In the transfer function representation of single-input, single-output (SISO) linear systems, 
zeros and poles are the roots of the numerator and the denominator polynomials, respectively.
% 
In the state-space form of a SISO as well as a MIMO linear system, the system's poles are a subset of the eigenvalues of the dynamics matrix.
% pole computation is thus an eigenvalue problem.  
% 
However, the zeros are not readily apparent in the state-space form. 
% 
Invariant zeros of a MIMO system with a state-space realization $(A,B,C,D)$, which are the complex numbers for which the rank of the Rosenbrock system matrix  
\begin{align}
    \SZ (\lambda) 
        =
            \matl 
                \lambda I - A & B \\C & -D
            \matr,
\end{align}
% where $(A,B,C,D)$ is a state-space realization of the system,
drops, are a subset of the generalized eigenvalues of the Rosenbrock system matrix \cite{laub1978calculation,tokarzewski2011invariant,tokarzewski2009zeros}. 
% 
% Since \eqref{eq:state_x}, \eqref{eq:output_y} is square, the zeros are given by the generalized eigenvalues of the systems's Rosenbrock matrix 
% 
% Since $\SZ(\lambda)$ is a regular pencil, its generalized eigenvalues are the zeros of the system \cite{laub1978calculation}.
% 
% The zeros of \eqref{eq:state_x}, \eqref{eq:output_y} thus can be alternatively obtained by computing the generalized eigenvalues of $\SZ(\lambda)$.


The generalized eigenvalues of the Rosenbrock system matrix can be computed by decomposing it into the generalized Schur form as shown in \cite{emami1982computation, misra1994computation,misra1989computation,misra1989minimal}. 
% 
However, this approaches yields extraneous zeros, which are removed heuristically. 
% The generalized Schur decomposition 
% Several computational techniques, all of which involve the decomposition of the Rosenbrock system matrix into the generalized Schur form, to solve this problem are described in \cite{emami1982computation, misra1994computation,misra1989computation,misra1989minimal}. 
% 
% In this paper, we consider the problem of computing the zeros of the system
% \begin{align}
%     \lambda x &= A x + Bu, \label{eq:state_x} \\
%     y &= Cx + Du, \label{eq:output_y}
% \end{align}
% where $x\in \BBR^{l_x}$ is the state, 
% $u \in \BBR$ is the input,  
% $y \in \BBR$ is the output, 
% $A,B,C,D$ are real matrices of appropriate dimensions, 
% and 
% the operator $\lambda$ is the time-derivative operator or the forward-shift operator. 
% 
Alternatively, since zeros are invariant under output feedback and the closed-loop poles approach the zeros of the system under high-gain output feedback, 
the zeros of $(A,B,C,D)$ are a subset of the eigenvalues of $\lim_{K \to \infty } A+ BK(I- D K)^{-1} C$ \cite{davison1978algorithm,garbow1977matrix}.
% 
% this approach can be used to approximate the zeros of the system \cite{davison1978algorithm}.  
% The zeros of $(A,B,C,D)$ are thus a subset of the eigenvalues of $\lim_{\rho \to \infty } A+\rho BK(I- \rho D K)^{-1} C.$
% The

Similar to the approach based on the Schur decomposition, this approach also yields extraneous zeros. 
Furthermore, both approaches are computationally expensive.

In this paper, we present a technique to compute the invariant zeros of a MIMO system that reduces the problem to an eigenvalue problem instead of a generalized eigenvalue problem. 
% 
Since the paper's main result does not depend on the minimality of the realization, the computed zeros are indeed the invariant zeros of the state-space realization. 
% 
This technique is motivated by and is closely related to the normal form of a dynamic system \cite{isidori1985nonlinear,Khalil:1173048}. 
% 
Specifically, we construct a diffeomorphism that isolates the zeros in a partition of the transformed dynamics matrix. 
Next, we show that the zeros of the system are precisely the eigenvalues of this partition.
Finally, we show that the partitioned system is in fact the zero dynamics of the system. 
% 
This observation is stated in \cite[p.~514]{Khalil:1173048}, however, the numerator polynomial of the transfer function is used to construct the state-space realization of the zero dynamics. 
% 
In contrast, in this paper, we construct the zero dynamics as well as compute the zeros using the system's state-space realization, without requiring its transfer function. 
% 
% 
 

A similar geometric approach, based on differential geometry, is described in \cite{basile1992controlled,morris2010invariant} to compute the invariant zeros of the system by solving an eigenvalue problem.  
In contrast, in this paper, we construct the eigenvalue problem, whose solution provides the invariant zeros, by constructing a simple state transformation matrix.
Furthermore, we present a simplified proof that does not require differential geometry concepts and is instead based on simple algebra.

Although all results presented in the paper are applicable to square MIMO systems as well, due to page limits, we restrict the proofs to the case of SISO systems. 
% 
The technique to compute the zeros can be easily extended to wide MIMO systems as shown in an example in Section \ref{sec:examples}.
However, the technique does not work in the case of tall MIMO systems since the construction of the zero-subspace form yields a singular transformation matrix. 
Ad-hoc techniques such as modifying the rows of the transformation matrix to make it nonsingular yield mixed and inconclusive results. 
The paper thus does not consider the case of tall MIMO systems.

The paper is organized as follows. 
Section \ref{sec:notation} presents the notation used in this paper,

Section \ref{sec:main_result} presents and proves the main result of the paper,

\section{Notation}
\label{sec:notation}
Let $A \in \BBR^{n\times m}.$
Then, $A_{[i,j]}$ is the matrix obtained by removing the $i$th row and $j$th column of $A.$
Note that, if $i=0,$ then only the $j$th column is removed.
Similarly, if $j=0,$ then only the $i$th row is removed.
That is, $A_{[0,0]} = A.$
% 
The set of integers between $n$ and $m$, where $n\leq m,$ that is, $\{n, n+1, \ldots, m\},$ is denoted by $\{ \iota \}_{n}^{m} .$ 
% 
$0_{n \times m}$ denotes the $n \times m$ zero matrix and 
$I_n$ denotes the $n\times n$ identity matrix.

\section{zero-subspace form}
\label{sec:ZSF}
This section introduces the \textit{zero-subspace form} of a linear system.
% of a SISO linear system.
% 
The zero-subspace form is a realization in which the zeros of the system are the eigenvalues of a partition of the dynamics matrix.
% of the system represented in the zero-subspace form. 
% 
% Specifically, zeros are the eigenvalues of the upper
% 

% 



% In the following, we construct a state-transformation matrix to transform a given state-space realization of a linear system to its zero-subspace form.
% 
% and show that the zeros of the system, which are invariant under state-transformation, are the eigenvalues of a partition of the transformed dynamics matrix.


Consider a linear system
\begin{align}
    \lambda x &= A x + Bu, \label{eq:state_x} \\
    y &= Cx, \label{eq:output_y}
\end{align}
where $x\in \BBR^{l_x}$ is the state, 
$u \in \BBR^{l_u}$ is the input, 
$y \in \BBR^{l_y}$ is the output, and 
the operator $\lambda$ is the time-derivative operator or the forward-shift operator. 
The relative degree of $y_i$ is denoted by $\rho_i,$ and the relative degree of $y,$ defined as $\sum_i^{l_y} \rho_i,$ is denoted by $\rho.$
% 
% Consider a linear system
% \begin{align}
%     \lambda x &= A x + Bu, \label{eq:state_x} \\
%     y &= Cx, \label{eq:output_y}
% \end{align}
% where $x\in \BBR^{l_x}$ is the state, 
% $u \in \BBR$ is the input,  
% $y \in \BBR$ is the output, and 
% the operator $\lambda$ is the time-derivative operator or the forward-shift operator. 
% Let the relative degree of $y$ be denoted by $\rho.$
% 
% 

Note that \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y} is a strictly proper system since $D = 0.$ 
Although the main result presented in this paper requires $\rho>0,$ that is, direct feedthrough term $D=0,$ it is not a restrictive condition since, without affecting the zeros of the system, the dynamic extension of the system with an additional pole renders the direct feedthrough term $D$ of the augmented system zero. 
Example \ref{exmp:D_nonzero} considers the case of an exactly proper system. 


Due to substantially lengthier and more complex proofs in the case of  multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) linear systems, we restrict our attention to single-input, single-output (SISO) linear systems in the following. 
% 
% In the following, we transform a realization of a single-input, single-output (SISO) linear system into its zero-subspace form. 
% 
However, the main result of this paper and the procedure to transform a realization of a MIMO system into its zero-subspace form is the same as that of a SISO system.
% 
% However, 



First, we construct a diffeomorphism to transform a realization into the zero-subspace form, as shown below.  
Let $\overline B \in \BBR^{l_x -1 \times l_x}$ be a full rank matrix such that $\overline B B = 0.$
% 
Note that $B \in \SN(\overline{B}),$ and thus, in MATLAB, $\overline B$ can be computed using \texttt{null(B')}.
Define 
\begin{align}
    \overline{C}
        \isdef 
            \matl
                C\\
                CA\\

and

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:Tbar_full_rank}
    Let $\overline T$ be given by \eqref{eq:Tbar_def}.
    Then, $\rank \ \overline T = l_x.$
\end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
\textbf{Proof.}
    Note that $\overline B$ has $l_x-1$ linearly independent rows. 
    % 
    Since the relative degree of $y$ is $\rho,$ it follows that, for 
    % $$i \in \{ 1, \ldots, \rho-1 \}, $$
    $ i \in \{ \iota \}_{\iota =1}^{\rho-1}, $
    $C A^{i-1} B = 0,$ which implies that each element of $\{ C, CA, \ldots, CA^{\rho-2} \}$ is in the row range space of $\overline B.$
    % 
    Furthermore, since $ C A^{\rho-1} B \neq 0,$ it follows that $C A^{\rho-1}$ is not linearly dependent on the rows of $\overline B,$ thus implying that $\rank \ \overline T = l_x.$
    \qed
% \end{proof}


% \subsection{Transformation Matrix}
Next, define $l_z \isdef l_x - \rho$ and  
\begin{align}
    T 
        \isdef 
            \matl 
                B_\rmz \\
                \overline C
            \matr 
            \in \BBR^{l_x \times l_x},
    \label{eq:T_def}
\end{align}
where 
$B_\rmz \in \BBR^{l_z \times l_x}$ is chosen such that rows of $B_\rmz$ and rows of $\overline C$ are linearly independent. 
% 
Consequently, $ T$ is full-rank and thus invertible. 
% 
Note that $\SR(B_\rmz^\rmT) \subseteq \SR(\overline B^\rmT).$ 
% 
% 
% \subsection{Transformed State Space}
    % where $T$ is given by \eqref{eq:T_def}.
    % state-transformation matrix
    Using the diffeomorphism $T,$ transform the realization $(A,B,C)$ into the zero-subspace form $(\SA,\SB,\SC),$ which implies that  
    \begin{align}
        \SA \isdef T A T^{-1}, \quad 
        \SB 
            \isdef
                TB, \quad 
        \SC 
            \isdef 
                C T^{-1}.
        \label{eq:ZSF_SS}
    \end{align}

    Next, define $\eta \in \BBR^{l_z}$ as the first $l_z$ components of $Tx$ and 
    $\xi \in \BBR^{\rho}$ as the rest of $Tx, $ that is, 
    \begin{align}
        \matl 
            \eta \\
            \xi 
        \matr 
            =
                T x.
        \label{eq:state_transformation}
    \end{align}
    Note that since $\eta \in \SR(B_\rmz),$ we call $\SR(B_\rmz)$ the \textit{zero subspace} of the system. 

%     Substituting \eqref{eq:state_transformation} in \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y} yields
%     \begin{align}
%         \matl 
%             \dot \eta \\
%             \dot \xi 
%         \matr 
%             &= 
%                 \SA 
%                 \matl 
%                     \eta \\
%                     \xi 
%                 \matr 
%                 + \SB u, \label{eq:state_chi} \\
%         y 
%             &=
%                 \SC \matl 
%                         \eta \\
%                         \xi 
%                     \matr  , \label{eq:output_y_chi}
%     \end{align}
%     where
%     \begin{align}
%     \SA \isdef T A T^{-1}, \quad 
%     \SB 
%         \isdef
%             TB, \quad 
%     \SC 
%         \isdef 
%             C T^{-1}.
%     \label{eq:ZSF_SS}
% \end{align}



    % With T defined as a section of Tbar, 
    % The new state space is this where A, B, C have special structures

Next, partition $\SA$ as
\begin{align}
    \SA 
        =
            \matl 
                \SA_{\eta} & \SA_{\eta \xi} \\
                \SA_{\xi \eta} & \SA_{\xi}
            \matr,
\end{align}
where $\SA_\eta$ is the $l_z \times l_z$ upper-left block,
$\SA_{\eta \xi}$ is the $l_z \times \rho$ upper-right block, 
$\SA_{\xi \eta}$ is the $\rho \times l_z$ lower-left block, and 
$\SA_\xi$ is the $\rho \times \rho$ lower-right block of $\SA.$
% 
% 

Finally, define $S \isdef T^{-1}$ and partition $S$ as $S = \matl S_\eta & S_\xi \matr,$ where $S_\eta \in \BBR^{l_x \times l_z}$ contains the first $l_z$ columns of $S$ and $S_\xi \in \BBR^{l_x \times \rho}$ contains the last $\rho$ columns of $S.$
% 
Substituting $T$ and $S$ in \eqref{eq:ZSF_SS} yields
\begin{align}
    \SA_\eta  &=  B_\rmz A S_\eta,
    \label{eq:SA_eta_def}
    \\ 
    \SA_{\eta \xi}  &= B_\rmz A S_\xi, \\ 
    \SA_{\xi \eta}  &= \overline C A S_\eta, \label{eq:SA_xi_eta_def} \\ 
    \SA_\xi  &= \overline C A S_\xi. \label{eq:SA_xi_def} 
\end{align}

As will be shown in the next section, the zeros of \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y} are the 
% eigenvalues of the partition of $\SA$ corresponding to $\eta$ dynamics, that is, the zeros of the system are the
eigenvalues of $\SA_\eta$ given by \eqref{eq:SA_eta_def}.
% 


\subsection{Sparse Structure of the zero-subspace form}
The following two facts about the zero-subspace form show that the matrices $\SA_{\xi\eta},$ $\SA_\xi,$ $\SB,$ and $\SC$ have \textit{sparse} structure. 

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:SA_xi_eta_form}
    Let $\SA_{\xi \eta}$ and $\SA_\xi$ be defined by \eqref{eq:SA_xi_eta_def} and \eqref{eq:SA_xi_def}.
    Then, 
    \begin{align}        
        A_{\xi \eta}
            &=
                \matl
                    0_{(\rho-1) \times l_z}\\
                    CA^{\rho} S_\eta
                \matr,
        \label{eq:SA_xi_eta_def_2}
    \\ 
        A_{\xi }
            &=
                \matl
                    \matl 
                        0_{(\rho-1) \times 1} & I_{\rho-1}
                    \matr \\
                    CA^{\rho} S_\xi
                \matr. 
    % \in \BBR^{\rho \times l_z},
    \label{eq:SA_xi_def_2}
    \end{align}
\end{proposition}
\textbf{Proof.}
Since $\matl B_\rmz \\ \overline C \matr \matl S_\eta & S_\xi \matr = I_{l_x},$ it follows that 
% $\overline C S_\eta = 0_{\rho \times l_z}$ and 
% $\overline C S_\xi = I_{\rho }$
% and thus
% $\overline C S_\eta = 0_{\rho \times \rho},$
% 
\begin{align}
    \overline C S_\eta         
        &=
            \matl 
                C \\
                \vdots\\
                C A^{\rho-1} 
            \matr 
            S_\eta  
        =
            0_{\rho \times l_z}, \nn
    \\
    \overline C S_\xi         
        &=
            \matl 
                C \\
                \vdots\\
                C A^{\rho-1} 
            \matr 
            S_\xi  
        =
            I_{\rho}, \nn
\end{align}
which implies that, for each 
% $j \in \{0, \ldots, \rho-1\},$ 
$ j \in \{ \iota \}_{\iota =0}^{\rho-1}, $ $C  A^{j} S_\eta = 0$
and 
$CA^j S_\xi = e_{j+1},$ where $e_j$ is the $j$th row of $I_\rho.$ 
% 
% 
Therefore, 
\begin{align*}
    \SA_{\xi \eta}  
        &=
            \overline C A S_\eta
        = 
            \matl 
                CA S_\eta\\
                \vdots\\
                C A^{\rho-1} S_\eta \\
                C A^{\rho} S_\eta
            \matr             
        =
            \matl
                0_{(\rho-1) \times l_z}\\
                C A^{\rho} S_\eta
            \matr,
        \\
    \SA_{\xi}  
        &=
            \overline C A S_\xi
        = 
            \matl 
                CA S_\xi\\
                \vdots\\
                C A^{\rho-1} S_\xi \\
                C A^{\rho} S_\xi
            \matr             
        =
            \matl
                \matl 
                    0_{(\rho-1) \times 1} & I_{\rho-1}
                \matr \\
                CA^{\rho} S_\xi
            \matr.
    \EndProofInEq
\end{align*}
    



\begin{proposition}
    Let $\SB$ and $\SC$ be defined by \eqref{eq:ZSF_SS}.
    Then, 
    \begin{align}
    \SB 
        =

                0_{1\times l_z} &
                1
                &
                0_{1\times (\rho-1)}
            \matr.
\end{align}
\end{proposition}
\textbf{Proof.}
Note that, for each 
% $j \in \{ 0, \ldots, \rho-1\},$
$ j \in \{ \iota \}_{\iota =0}^{\rho-1}, $
$C A^j B = 0,$ which implies 
\begin{align}
    \SB
        =
            TB
        =
            \matl
                B_\rmz B\\
                \overline C B
            \matr 
        =
            \matl
                0_{l_z \times l_u}\\
                \matl
                    C\\
                    CA\\
                    \vdots\\
                    CA^{\rho-1}
                \matr
                B
            \matr 
        =
            \matl
                0_{(l_x-1) \times 1}\\
                CA^{\rho-1} B
            \matr.
            \nn
\end{align}
Next, since $C$ is the $(l_z+1)$th row of $T,$ and
\begin{align*}
    C 
        =
            \SC T 
        =

        =
            \SC
            \matl
                B_\rmz \\
                C\\
                CA\\

            \matr, 
            % \EndProofInEq
\end{align*}
it follows that $\SC = \matl
                0_{1 \times l_z}
                &
                1
                & 
                \cdots 
                & 
                0_{1 \times \rho -1}

\section{Main Result}
\label{sec:main_result}
This section presents the paper's main result, that is, the zeros of a SISO linear system are the eigenvalues of a partition of the dynamics matrix represented in its zero-subspace form.
% 
Specifically, Theorem \ref{theorem:zeros} shows that the zeros of the system \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y} are exactly the eigenvalues of $A_\eta.$ 


The following lemma appears in \cite{powell2011calculating} and is used in the proof of Theorem \ref{theorem:zeros}.
\begin{lemma}
    Let $A = \matl A_{11} & A_{12} \\ A_{21} & A_{22} \matr,$ where $A_{11}$ is square and $A_{22}$ is nonsingular. 
    Then, 
    \begin{align}
        \det A
            =
                \det 
                \left( 
                    A_{11}  - A_{12} A_{22}^{-1} A_{21}
                \right)
                \det A_{22}.
    \end{align}
\end{lemma}


% \subsection{Useful Properties of the zero-subspace form}
The following two facts about the zero-subspace form are 
% used in the proof of the main result of the paper. 
 used in the proof of Theorem \ref{theorem:zeros}.

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:SA_xi_eta_rho0}
    Let $\SA_{\xi \eta}$ be defined by \eqref{eq:SA_xi_eta_def}.
    Then, 
    \begin{align}
        {\SA}_{\xi \eta_{[\rho,0]}} = 0_{(\rho-1) \times l_z}.
        \label{eq:SA_xi_eta_rho0}
    \end{align}
\end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
\textbf{Proof.}
    Note that $\SA_{\xi \eta}$ is given by \eqref{eq:SA_xi_eta_def_2}.
    % ${\SA}_{\xi \eta_{[\rho,0]}}$ is obtained by 
    Removing the $\rho$th row of ${\SA}_{\xi \eta}$ yields \eqref{eq:SA_xi_eta_rho0}.
    {\hfill {\qed}}
% \end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    \label{prop:sI-Axi_rho1}
    Let $\SA_\xi$ be defined by \eqref{eq:SA_xi_def}.
    Then, for all $s\in \BBC,$ 
    \begin{align}
        \det \left( (sI_\rho - \SA_\xi)_{[\rho,1]} \right)= \pm 1.
        \label{eq:sI-Axi_rho1}
    \end{align}
\end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}    
\textbf{Proof.}
Note that $\SA_{\xi}$ is given by \eqref{eq:SA_xi_def_2}.
Removing the $\rho$th row and the first column of $\SA_\xi$ yields
\begin{align}
    (sI_\rho - \SA_\xi)_{[\rho,1]}
        &=
            \matl
                -1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0\\
                s & -1 & \cdots & 0 & 0\\
                \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
                0 & 0 & \cdots & -1 & 0\\
                0 & 0 & \cdots & s & -1
            \matr, \nn
\end{align}
which implies \eqref{eq:sI-Axi_rho1}.
{\hfill {\qed}}

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:zeros}
Consider the system \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y}
and its zero-subspace form \eqref{eq:ZSF_eta_dot}-\eqref{eq:ZSF_y}.
Then, the zeros of the system \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y} are the eigenvalues of $\SA_\eta$. 
\end{theorem}
\textbf{Proof.}
Note that the zeros of the system \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y} satisfy
\begin{align}
   C \adj (sI-A) B=0. \nn 
\end{align}
Since the zeros are invariant under state transformation, it follows that the zeros also satisfies
\begin{align}
    \SC \adj (sI- \SA ) \SB=0. 
    \label{eq:zeros_adj_equation}
\end{align}
Next, note that

% Where $\overline{\SA}_{\eta \xi}$ is the $\SA_{\eta \xi}$ matrix without the $l_x-\rho-1$ column, $\overline{\SA}_{\xi \eta}$ is the $\SA_{\xi \eta}$ matrix without the last row, and $\overline{s I_{(\rho-1)} -\SA_{\xi}}$ is the $s I_{\rho} -\SA_{\xi}$ matrix without the last row and without the $l_x-\rho-1$ column.

Since the relative degree of the system is $\rho,$ $CA^{\rho-1}B \neq 0.$

Therefore, \eqref{eq:zeros_adj_equation} is satisfied if and only if $\det (sI_{l_z}-\SA_{\eta} ) = 0,$ thus implying that the zeros of the system \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y} are the eigenvalues of $\SA_{\eta}.$

\begin{remark}
    Note that $\SA_\eta$ has $l_z$ eigenvalues and thus \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y} has $l_z=l_x-\rho$ zeros, which is a well-known fact.

%     \section{Zeros of Transfer Function}
% \label{sec:ZerosTF}
% In this section, we use a well-known interpretation of the zeros of a transfer function to provide an alternate, \textit{albeit} simplistic motivation for the zeros being eigenvalues of the dynamics matrix partition.  
A simplistic proof of the zeros being the eigenvalues of a partition of the zero-subspace form can be motivated by the blocking property of zeros. 
% 
% The zeros of a SISO transfer function are the roots of the numerator of the transfer function, that is, ${\rm zeros}(G) = {\rm roots}(N),$ where 
% \begin{align}
%     G(s) 
%         =
%             \frac{N(s)}{D(s)}.
% \end{align}
% 
% The complete response of the system $G$ is given by
% \begin{align}
%     Y(s) 
%         =
%             G(s) U(s) 
%             +
%             \sum
% \end{align}
% 
% Consider the case where the system is asymptotically stable.
Let $z$ denote a zero of an asymptotically stable system. 
% 
% It is a well-known fact that 
% For each $z \in \zeros(G)$, 
It follows that the input $u(t) = e^{zt} u_0$ yields zero asymptotic output, that is, 
% Let $z \in \BBC$ be a zero of the system \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y}.
% It thus follows that for the input $u(t) = e^{zt} u_0,$ 
$
    \lim_{t \to \infty} y(t)= 0,
$
% Note that this is the \textit{blocking property} of the zero.
which implies that  
$
    \lim_{t \to \infty} \xi(t)= 0.
$
% since $\xi$ is a chain of integrators and the system is assumed to be asymptotically stable.
It follows from \eqref{eq:ZSF_xi_dot} that
\begin{align}
    \lim_{t \to \infty} \SA_{\xi \eta} \eta (t) + \SB_\xi u(t) = 0.
    \label{eq:eta_u_diverging}
\end{align}
Now, consider the case where $\real(z)>0.$
% Assume that $\real(z) > 0.$
Since $u(t) = e^{zt} u_0$ diverges, it follows that $\eta(t)$ must diverge to satisfy \eqref{eq:eta_u_diverging}.
In fact, $\eta(t)$ must grow exponentially as $e^{zt}$ to satisfy \eqref{eq:eta_u_diverging}.
Since $\xi(t) \to 0,$ it follows from \eqref{eq:ZSF_eta_dot} that $\eta(t)$ grows exponentially if and only if $z \in \text{spec}(A_\eta).$

Consider the square MIMO system \eqref{eq:state_x}, \eqref{eq:output_y}

\section{Normal Form of a Linear System}
\label{sec:normal_form}
This section shows the relation between the zero-subspace form \eqref{eq:ZSF_eta_dot}-\eqref{eq:ZSF_y} of a system and its normal form.
% 
In the nonlinear systems theory, the normal form is used to decompose a nonlinear system into its zero dynamics and the input-output feedback linearizable dynamics \cite{isidori1985nonlinear,Khalil:1173048}. 
% 
% We show that both the zero-subspace form and the normal form decompose a linear system into the same 
This section shows that a system's normal form can also be used to deduce its zeros.
% of the system by solving an eigenvalue problem. 
% 
% In fact, the normal form is the zero-subspace form. 

% and illuminate a connection between the zero dynamics of the system and the partition of the dynamics matrix of the zero-subspace form. 
% 

% In general, the normal form of a nonlinear affine system is used to construct input-output linearizing controllers \cite{isidori1985nonlinear}.
% % 
% In the normal form, the system is decomposed into its zero dynamics and a chain of integrators. 
% % 
% Arbitrary closed-loop input-output dynamics can then be imposed by cancellation using a full-state feedback control law.

% 
% In this paper, we use the normal form to expose the zero dynamics of the system and present its connection with the zero-subspace form. 
% 
To maintain consistent notation, the procedure to transform a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO), nonlinear affine system to its normal form is summarized in Appendix \hyperref[appndx:normalForm]{A}.
% 
In the case of a SISO linear system,
$
    f(x) = Ax, \
    g(x) = B, $ and $
    h(x) = Cx,
$
and thus it follows from \eqref{eq:alpha_def}, \eqref{eq:beta_def} that
\begin{align}
    \alpha(x) 
        &=
            L_f^\rho h(x)
        =
            CA^{\rho} x,
        \\
    \beta(x) 
        &=
            L_g L_f^{\rho-1} h(x)
        =
            CA^{\rho-1} B.
\end{align}
Furthermore, 
\begin{align}
    \psi(x)
        =
            \matl 
                C \\
                CA \\
                \vdots \\
                CA^{\rho-1}
            \matr x
        . 
\end{align}
Note that $\psi(x)  = \overline C x,$ where $\overline C$ is defined by \eqref{eq:Cbar_def}.
Finally, let $\phi(x) = B_\rmn x,$ where $B_\rmn$ is chosen to satisfy $L_g \phi(x) = B_\rmn B = 0.$ 
% 
Note that 
\begin{align}
        \matl 
            \eta \\
            \xi 
        \matr 
            =
                \matl 
                    \phi(x) \\
                    \psi(x) 
                \matr
            =
                \matl 
                    B_\rmn \\
                    \overline C
                \matr x,
        \label{eq:state_transformation_NF}
    \end{align}
and thus $x = R_\eta \eta + R_\xi \xi, $ where 
\begin{align}
    \matl R_\eta & R_\xi \matr
        =
            \matl 
                B_\rmn \\
                \overline C
            \matr^{-1}.
\end{align}
% 
Note that the state-transformation matrix in \eqref{eq:state_transformation_NF} is invertible.
The proof is similar to the proof of Proposition \ref{prop:Tbar_full_rank}.
% 
The normal form of \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y} is then
\begin{align}
    \dot \eta 
        &=
            B_\rmn A x
        =
            B_\rmn A R_\eta \eta + B_\rmn A R_\xi \xi
        ,
    \label{eq:NF_eta_dot}
        \\
    \dot \xi
        &=
            B_\rmc
            CA^{\rho} 
            A R_\eta \eta 
            + 
            (A_\rmc 
            +
            B_\rmc
            CA^{\rho} 
            A R_\xi) \xi
            +
            B_\rmc
            CA^{\rho-1} B u,
    \label{eq:NF_xi_dot}
    \\
    y
        &=
            \xi_1,
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
    A_{\rmc}
        &\isdef 
            \matl 
                0 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0  \\
                0 & 0 & 1 & \cdots & 0  \\
                \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots \\
                0 & \vdots & \ldots & 0 & 1  \\
                0 & \vdots & \ldots & 0 & 0  \\
            \matr
        \in \BBR^{\rho \times \rho},
    % \\
    \quad 
    B_{\rmc}
        \isdef 
            \matl 
                0\\
                \vdots \\
                1
            \matr
        \in \BBR^{\rho}.
\end{align}

Note that since $B_\rmz$ and $B_\rmn$ satisfy exactly the same conditions, it follows that  $\SR(B_\rmz) = \SR(B_\rmn)$ and therefore \eqref{eq:ZSF_eta_dot}, \eqref{eq:ZSF_xi_dot} are same as \eqref{eq:NF_eta_dot}, \eqref{eq:NF_xi_dot}.
In fact, if $B_\rmn$ is chosen to be equal to $B_\rmz,$ then the zero-subspace form \eqref{eq:ZSF_eta_dot}, \eqref{eq:ZSF_xi_dot} is exactly the normal form of \eqref{eq:state_x}-\eqref{eq:output_y}.
% 
% If $B_\rmn = B_\rmz,$ then \eqref{eq:NF_xi_dot} is exactly the same as \eqref{ }
% \begin{align}
%     \SA_\eta  &= B_\rmz A S_\eta = B_\rmn A R_\eta , \\ 
%     \SA_{\eta \xi}  &= B_\rmn A S_\xi, \\ 
%     \SA_{\xi \eta}  &= \overline C A S_\eta,  \\ 
%     \SA_\xi  &= \overline C A S_\xi. 
% \end{align}

In the normal form, \eqref{eq:NF_eta_dot} is called the \textit{zero dynamics} of the system.
Theorem \ref{theorem:zeros} thus shows that \textit{zeros are the eigenvalues of the dynamics matrix of the zero dynamics.}
% ; that is, \textit{the zeros are the poles of the zero dynamics}.

\section{Numerical Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

This section presents several examples verifying the main result of this paper. 
These examples, listed in Table \ref{tab:examples}, show that the technique presented in the paper to compute the zeros can be extended to exactly proper systems and nonsquare MIMO systems and is not affected by pole-zero cancellations.

    \textbf{[Strictly proper SISO system.]}
    Consider the system

    A controllable canonical realization of $G$ is

        A
            &=

    Letting $B_\rmz\footnote{Computed using \texttt{null(B')'} in MATLAB.} = \matl 0 & 1 & 0\\
    1 & 0 & 0\matr,$ it follows from \eqref{eq:T_def} that

\begin{exmp}
\label{exmp:SISOsystem_w_zero_rd}
{\textbf{[SISO System with zero relative degree.]}}
\label{exmp:D_nonzero}
Consider the system
    \begin{align}
        G(s)=\dfrac{s^3+21s^2+116s+96}{s^3+11s^2+38s+40}.\nn
    \end{align}
    Note that   $\rho=0$ and $\zeros (G) = \{ -1,-8,-12 \}$.
    % 
    Furthermore, $l_z = 3$ and thus $\SA_\eta$ is $3 \times 3,$ which implies that $\SA_\eta$ and the dynamics matrix of $G$ are similar, that is, they have same eigenvalues.
    Therefore, in the case where $\rho=0,$ eigenvalues of $\SA_\eta$ are the poles of $G.$
    % and $\poles (G) = \{ -2,-4,-5 \}$
    Note that Theorem \ref{theorem:zeros} is not applicable in this case since $D \neq 0.$

    However, consider the system 
    \begin{align}
        \overline G(s)
            \isdef 
                \dfrac{G(s)}{s}
            =
                \dfrac{s^3+21s^2+116s+96}{s^4+11s^3+38s^2+40s}.\nn
    \end{align}
    Note that $\overline G(s)$ has the same set of zeros as $G(s),$ but its relative degree $\rho=1$.
    Therefore, Theorem \ref{theorem:zeros} can be used to compute the zeros of $\overline G,$ and thus the zeros of $G.$
    % 
    % Finding the zeros from the former problem using the ZSF will be impossible since $l_x=\rho$, and thus, there is no $\SA_{\eta}$. To use ZSF, we can analyse another system with the original poles and zeros and including an extra pole to make the SISO transfer function strictly proper. From the point of view of zeros, there is no restriction on the extra pole included in the new system. Nevertheless, since the analysis of most dynamical systems does not end in the identification of zeros, it is recommended to include a much more faster stable pole. In this specific example we chose to include $-100$ as the extra pole. Then, the auxiliar systems is
    % 
    % \begin{align}
    %     G_{\text{aux}}(s)=\dfrac{s^3+21s^2+116s+96}{s^4+111s^3+1138s^2+3840s+4000}.\nn

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper showed that similar to the poles computation, zeros of a state-space realization of a linear system can be computed by solving an eigenvalue problem instead of a generalized eigenvalue problem.

% 
% This paper presented the zero-subspace form and its connection with the normal form. 
% 
% The zero-subspace form allows the computation of zeros by solving a simple eigenvalue problem. 
% 
By transforming the system into its zero-subspace form, it is shown that the zeros are the eigenvalues of a partition of the dynamics matrix represented in the zero-subspace form, which is also the dynamics matrix of the system's zero dynamics.

% 
Numerical examples validate the main result of the paper.

% Future research is focused on extending the main result of this paper to multi-input, multi-output systems. 
Future research is focused on extending the main result of this paper to nonsquare MIMO systems. 
% Numerical examples in this paper suggest that the main result is valid for square MIMO systems.
Although the technique is easily extended to the case of wide systems, where it provides spurious invariant zeros, which can be removed heuristically, it provides inconclusive results in tall systems. 
% 
% In the case of tall systems, the construction yields a singular 
% 
An alternative approach may be to consider random bordering to square the nonsquare system and thus compute invariant zeros of the MIMO system. 

% However, the nonsquare systems can be squared by random bordering.  




% We extended the zero-subspace form to MIMO systems and presented numerical examples supporting the conjecture that the set of eigenvalues of the zero dynamics contains all invariant zeros.
