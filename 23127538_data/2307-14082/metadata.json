  "abstract": "This study explores the possibility of discovering $H^{\\pm}$ through its bosonic decays, i.e. $H^{\\pm}\\rightarrow W^\\pmφ$ (where $φ$ = h or A), within the Type-I Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM). The main objective is to demonstrate the available parameter space after applying the recent experimental and theoretical exclusion limits. We suggest that for $m_{H^\\pm}$ = 150 GeV is the most probable mass for the $H^\\pm\\rightarrow W^\\pmφ$ decay channel in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8, 13 and 14 TeV. Therefore we propose that this channel may be used as an alternative to $H^\\pm\\rightarrow τ^\\pmν$.",
