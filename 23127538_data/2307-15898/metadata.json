  "abstract": "Multimodal large models have been recognized for their advantages in various performance and downstream tasks. The development of these models is crucial towards achieving general artificial intelligence in the future. In this paper, we propose a novel universal language representation learning method called UniBriVL, which is based on Bridging-Vision-and-Language (BriVL). Universal BriVL embeds audio, image, and text into a shared space, enabling the realization of various multimodal applications. Our approach addresses major challenges in robust language (both text and audio) representation learning and effectively captures the correlation between audio and image. Additionally, we demonstrate the qualitative evaluation of the generated images from UniBriVL, which serves to highlight the potential of our approach in creating images from audio. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of UniBriVL in downstream tasks and its ability to choose appropriate images from audio. The proposed approach has the potential for various applications such as speech recognition, music signal processing, and captioning systems.",
