  "abstract": "We present a novel method for mining opinions from text collections using generative language models trained on data collected from different populations. We describe the basic definitions, methodology and a generic algorithm for opinion insight mining. We demonstrate the performance of our method in an experiment where a pre-trained generative model is fine-tuned using specifically tailored content with unnatural and fully annotated opinions. We show that our approach can learn and transfer the opinions to the semantic classes while maintaining the proportion of polarisation. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of an insight mining system to scale up the discovery of opinion insights from a real text corpus.",
