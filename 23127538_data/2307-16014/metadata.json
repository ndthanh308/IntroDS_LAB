  "abstract": "This article has two interpenetrating motifs. One is an exposition of some major ideas and techniques behind the use of block matrices, and especially their positivity properties. This is done by focussing on one major problem: characterisation of operators whose numerical radius is bounded by one. So, the article could serve as an introduction to that topic as well.",
