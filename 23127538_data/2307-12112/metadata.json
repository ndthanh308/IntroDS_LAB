  "abstract": "We consider the powers of leading order eigenvalue of the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov~(BFKL) equation at zero conformal spin. Using reflection identities of harmonic sums we demonstrate how involved generalized polygamma functions are introduced by pole separation of a rather simple digamma function. This generates higher weight generalized polygamma functions at any given order of perturbative expansion. As a byproduct of our analysis we develop a general technique for calculating powers of the real part of digamma function in a pole separated form.",
