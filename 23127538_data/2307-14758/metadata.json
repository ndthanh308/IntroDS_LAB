  "abstract": "There is a growing awareness of the harmful effects of distribution shift on the performance of deployed machine learning models. Consequently, there is a growing interest in detecting these shifts before associated costs have time to accumulate. However, desiderata of crucial importance to the practicable deployment of sequential shift detectors are typically overlooked by existing works, precluding their widespread adoption. We identify three such desiderata, highlight existing works relevant to their satisfaction, and recommend impactful directions for future research.",
