% \AP{Fundamental advantages of non-half-wavelength spaced array}
\begin{abstract}\vspace{0cm}
Holographic MIMO refers to an array (possibly large) with a massive number of antennas that are individually controlled and densely deployed. The aim of this paper is to provide further insights into the advantages (if any) of having closely spaced antennas in the uplink and downlink of a multi-user Holographic MIMO system. To this end, we make use of the multiport communication theory, which ensures physically consistent uplink and downlink models. We first consider a simple uplink scenario with two side-by-side half-wavelength dipoles, two users and single path line-of-sight propagation, and show both analytically and numerically that the \textcolor{blue}{array gain} and average spectral efficiency depend strongly on the directions from which the signals are received and on the array matching network used. The numerical results are subsequently leveraged to extend the analysis into more practical scenarios involving larger arrays of dipoles \textcolor{blue}{(arranged in a uniform linear array)} and a greater number of users. \textcolor{red}{The case where the antennas are densely packed in a space-constrained factor form is also considered. It is found that the spectral efficiency increases with decreasing antenna spacing only for arrays of moderate size, e.g. in the order of a few wavelengths. Comparatively, larger arrays exhibit only marginal improvements in spectral efficiency when compared to arrays with half-wavelength spacing.}

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

Building on the multiport communication theory (e.g.,~\cite{Nossek2014,Nossek2010}), a physically-consistent representation of MIMO channels can be derived and directly used by communication theorists as a baseline for modelling the uplink and downlink of holographic MIMO communications, with closely spaced antennas. Particularly, we used it to study the effects of mutual coupling on the spectral efficiency and to gain insights into interplay between antenna spacing and impedance matching network designs. \textcolor{blue}{We focused on side-by-side half-wavelength dipoles in a LoS scenario.} Numerical and analytical results showed that for the investigated scenarios, a fixed number of closely spaced antennas with impedance matching can provide spectral efficiency benefits, but only for specific directions of the incident signals. On average, the spectral efficiency gains may be marginal or even non-existent. We explored a scenario where antennas were closely packed in a space-constrained form, and we showed that reducing the antenna distance led to an increase in spectral efficiency. However, this increase becomes negligible as the array aperture size grows (in the order of tens of wavelengths). The uplink and duality duality was also investigated for different matching network designs. \textcolor{blue}{We limited our study to uniform linear arrays of side-by-side half-wavelength dipoles operating in LoS conditions. However, we notice that the analytical framework can be used to extend the results to different array configurations and non-LoS propagation conditions.}
