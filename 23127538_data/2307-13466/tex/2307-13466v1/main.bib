abstract = {Yields of crops must increase substantially over the coming decades to keep pace with global food demand driven by population and income growth. Ultimately global food production capacity will be limited by the amount of land and water resources available and suitable for crop production, and by biophysical limits on crop growth. Quantifying food production capacity on every hectare of current farmland in a consistent and transparent manner is needed to inform decisions on policy, research, development and investment that aim to affect future crop yield and land use, and to inform on-ground action by local farmers through their knowledge networks. Crop production capacity can be evaluated by estimating potential yield and water-limited yield levels as benchmarks for crop production under, respectively, irrigated and rainfed conditions. The differences between these theoretical yield levels and actual farmers’ yields define the yield gaps, and precise spatially explicit knowledge about these yield gaps is essential to guide sustainable intensification of agriculture. This paper reviews methods to estimate yield gaps, with a focus on the local-to-global relevance of outcomes. Empirical methods estimate yield potential from 90 to 95th percentiles of farmers’ yields, maximum yields from experiment stations, growers’ yield contests or boundary functions; these are compared with crop simulation of potential or water-limited yields. Comparisons utilize detailed data sets from western Kenya, Nebraska (USA) and Victoria (Australia). We then review global studies, often performed by non-agricultural scientists, aimed at yield and sometimes yield gap assessment and compare several studies in terms of outcomes for regions in Nebraska, Kenya and The Netherlands. Based on our review we recommend key components for a yield gap assessment that can be applied at local to global scales. Given lack of data for some regions, the protocol recommends use of a tiered approach with preferred use of crop growth simulation models applied to relatively homogenous climate zones for which measured weather data are available. Within such zones simulations are performed for the dominant soils and cropping systems considering current spatial distribution of crops. Need for accurate agronomic and current yield data together with calibrated and validated crop models and upscaling methods is emphasized. The bottom-up application of this global protocol allows verification of estimated yield gaps with on-farm data and experiments.}

Metamodels are sometimes called emulators because they emulate complex computer codes, and can be seen as simplified codes that behave (almost) like the original codes. When a complex model cannot be conveniently used in some circumstances, a metamodel may be run as a substitute for the original model. Metamodels are currently used in various research areas, for example, in hydrology (Razavi et al., 2012) or in ecology (Conti and O’Hagan, 2010). Recently, metamodels were used to emulate an ensemble of crop models and study the effect of climate change on crop yield (Makowski et al., 2015).}

abstract = {Surrogate modeling, also called metamodeling, has evolved and been extensively used over the past decades. A wide variety of methods and tools have been introduced for surrogate modeling aiming to develop and utilize computationally more efficient surrogates of high-fidelity models mostly in optimization frameworks. This paper reviews, analyzes, and categorizes research efforts on surrogate modeling and applications with an emphasis on the research accomplished in the water resources field. The review analyzes 48 references on surrogate modeling arising from water resources and also screens out more than 100 references from the broader research community. Two broad families of surrogates namely response surface surrogates, which are statistical or empirical data-driven models emulating the high-fidelity model responses, and lower-fidelity physically based surrogates, which are simplified models of the original system, are detailed in this paper. Taxonomies on surrogate modeling frameworks, practical details, advances, challenges, and limitations are outlined. Important observations and some guidance for surrogate modeling decisions are provided along with a list of important future research directions that would benefit the common sampling and search (optimization) analyses found in water resources.},

abstract = {Abstract A new and relatively simple equation for the soil-water content-pressure head curve, θ(h), is described in this paper. The particular form of the equation enables one to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the relative hydraulic conductivity, Kr, when substituted in the predictive conductivity models of N.T. Burdine or Y. Mualem. The resulting expressions for Kr(h) contain three independent parameters which may be obtained by fitting the proposed soil-water retention model to experimental data. Results obtained with the closed-form analytical expressions based on the Mualem theory are compared with observed hydraulic conductivity data for five soils with a wide range of hydraulic properties. The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is predicted well in four out of five cases. It is found that a reasonable description of the soil-water retention curve at low water contents is important for an accurated prediction of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.},

abstract = {Abstract Rainfall in the northeastern United States can be erratic, causing fluctuations in the supply and quality of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). To address these problems, yield and quality of potato were studied during three growing seasons to determine their response to soil management treatments designed to increase soil organic matter. The soil management treatments, consisting of rotation crop [oat (Avena sativa L. cv. Porter vs. green manure] and annual soil amendment applications [none vs. 22 t ha−1 compost and 45 t ha−1 manure from beef cattle (Bos taurus L.)], were tested in combination with supplemental irrigation treatments (none, reduced, and moderate) on a Caribou gravelly loam (fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Haplorthod). The green manure consisted of pea (Pisum sativum L. cv. Trapper), oat, and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) seeded at 168, 56, and 34 kg ha−1, respectively. After a single season, the amendments increased soil organic matter, K, Mg, Ca, cation exchange capacity, and aggregation. Modified-Morgan soil-test P increased and bulk density decreased after two amendment applications. Total yields were significantly increased by the amendment treatment [8.6 t ha−1 (23\%), 1993; 8.1 t ha−1 (27\%), 1994; and 4.0 t ha−1 (11\%) for 1995], and U.S. No. 1 yields were similarly affected. The amendments increased tuber decay incidence during all 3 yr. Irrigation treatments significantly increased total yields by 10 t ha−1 (36\%) in 1994 and 11.6 t ha−1 (37\%) in 1995, while significantly reducing specific gravity and increasing tuber size. Irrigation also increased tuber decay incidence in 2 of 3 yr. During the time course and under the conditions of this study, the green manure rotation crop had no significant effect on yields or tuber quality compared with the oat rotation. In contrast, soil amendment and supplemental irrigation proved to be management tools that could rapidly affect productivity in this agricultural system.},

               contains many different types of models with parameters learned
               from the data themselves and where domain knowledge is only used
               to select the predictors and engineer features. In the second
               category, models are based upon biophysical principles, whose
               structure and parameters are derived primarily from domain
               knowledge. Here we investigate if the integration of the two
               approaches can be beneficial as it allows to overcome the
               limitations of the two approaches taken individually - lack of
               sufficiently large, reliable and orthogonal datasets for
               data-driven approaches and the need of many inputs for
               process-based models. The applications of the two categories of

               engineer features and expand the predictors space, (2) use
               data-driven approaches to estimate missing inputs for
               process-based models (3) using data-driven approaches to produce

  abstract  = "Many studies have applied machine learning to crop yield
               prediction with a focus on specific case studies. The data and
               methods they used may not be transferable to other crops and
               locations. On the other hand, operational large-scale systems,
               such as the European Commission's MARS Crop Yield Forecasting
               System (MCYFS), do not use machine learning. Machine learning is
               a promising method especially when large amounts of data are
               being collected and published. We combined agronomic principles
               of crop modeling with machine learning to build a machine
               learning baseline for large-scale crop yield forecasting. The
               baseline is a workflow emphasizing correctness, modularity and
               reusability. For correctness, we focused on designing
               explainable predictors or features (in relation to crop growth
               and development) and applying machine learning without
               information leakage. We created features using crop simulation
               outputs and weather, remote sensing and soil data from the MCYFS
               database. We emphasized a modular and reusable workflow to
               support different crops and countries with small configuration
               changes. The workflow can be used to run repeatable experiments
               (e.g. early season or end of season predictions) using standard
               input data to obtain reproducible results. The results serve as
               a starting point for further optimizations. In our case studies,
               we predicted yield at regional level for five crops (soft wheat,
               spring barley, sunflower, sugar beet, potatoes) and three
               countries (the Netherlands (NL), Germany (DE), France (FR)). We
               compared the performance with a simple method with no prediction
               skill, which either predicted a linear yield trend or the
               average of the training set. We also aggregated the predictions
               to the national level and compared with past MCYFS forecasts.
               The normalized RMSE (NRMSE) for early season predictions (30
               days after planting) were comparable for NL (all crops), DE (all
               except soft wheat) and FR (soft wheat, spring barley,
               sunflower). For example, NRMSE was 7.87 for soft wheat (NL)
               (6.32 for MCYFS) and 8.21 for sugar beet (DE) (8.79 for MCYFS).
               In contrast, NRMSEs for soft wheat (DE), sugar beet (FR) and
               potatoes (FR) were twice as much compared to MCYFS. NRMSEs for
               end of season were still comparable to MCYFS for NL, but worse
               for DE and FR. The baseline can be improved by adding new data
               sources, designing more predictive features and evaluating
               different machine learning algorithms. The baseline will
               motivate the use of machine learning in large-scale crop yield
               forecasting.",
