Our approach synthesizes recent advances in materials growth with tools commonly used in quantum-dot experiments, including gate control of tunnel barriers and Coulomb effects, charge sensing, and charge pumping. We outline a sequence of milestones interpolating between zero-mode detection and quantum computing that includes (1) detection of fusion rules for non-Abelian anyons using either proximal charge sensors or pumped current, (2) validation of a prototype topological qubit, and (3) demonstration of non-Abelian statistics by braiding in a branched geometry. The first two milestones require only a single wire with two islands, and additionally enable sensitive measurements of the system's excitation gap, quasiparticle poisoning rates, residual {Majorana} zero-mode splittings, and topological-qubit coherence times. These pre-braiding experiments can be adapted to other manipulation and read out schemes as well.},

This occurs as an external magnetic field tunes the wire into the topological regime and the energy splitting of the emergent {Majorana} modes oscillates around zero energy owing to their wave function spatial overlap in finite-length wires. In particular, we discuss how these {Majorana} oscillations, and the concomitant fermion parity switches in the ground state of the junction, result in distinct spectroscopic features --in the form of an intermitent visibility of absorption lines-- that strongly deviate from standard transmon behavior. In contrast, non-oscillating zero modes, such as topologically trivial {Andreev} bound states resulting from sufficiently smooth potentials, exhibit an overall standard transmon response. These differences in the MW response could help determine whether the junction contains topological {Majorana}s or not.},

  abstract      = {We theoretically study superconducting islands based on semiconductor-nanowire {Josephson} junctions and take into account the presence of subgap quasiparticle excitations in the spectrum of the junction. Our method extends the standard model Hamiltonian for a superconducting charge qubit and replaces the {Josephson} potential by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian of the nanowire junction, projected onto the relevant low-energy subgap subspace. This allows us to fully incorporate the coherent dynamics of subgap levels in the junction. The combined effect of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman energy in the nanowires forming the junction triggers a topological transition, where the subgap levels evolve from finite-energy {Andreev} bound states into near-zero-energy {Majorana} bound states. The interplay between the microscopic energy scales governing the nanowire junction (the {Josephson} energy, the {Majorana} coupling, and the {Majorana} energy splitting), with the charging energy of the superconducting island, gives rise to a great variety of physical regimes. Based on this interplay of different energy scales, we fully characterize the microwave response of the junction, from the Cooper pair box to the transmon regimes, and show how the presence of {Majorana}s can be detected through distinct spectroscopic features. In split-junction geometries, the plasma mode couples to the phase-dispersing subgap levels resulting from {Majorana} hybridization via a Jaynes-Cummings-like interaction. As a consequence of this interaction, higher order plasma excitations in the junction inherit {Majorana} properties, including the 4$\pi$ effect.},

  abstract      = {Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowires with {Rashba} spin-orbit coupling are arguably becoming the leading platform for the search of {Majorana} bound states (MBSs) in engineered topological superconductors. We perform a systematic numerical study of the low-energy {Andreev} spectrum and supercurrents in short and long superconductor-normal-superconductor junctions made of nanowires with strong {Rashba} spin-orbit coupling, where an external Zeeman field is applied perpendicular to the spin-orbit axis. In particular, we investigate the detailed evolution of the {Andreev} bound states from the trivial into the topological phase and their relation with the emergence of MBSs. Due to the finite length, the system hosts four MBSs, two at the inner part of the junction and two at the outer one. They hybridize and give rise to a finite energy splitting at a superconducting phase difference of p, a wellvisible effect that can be traced back to the evolution of the energy spectrum with the Zeeman field: from the trivial phase with {Andreev} bound states into the topological phase with MBSs. Similarly, we carry out a detailed study of supercurrents for short and long junctions from the trivial to the topological phases. The supercurrent, calculated from the {Andreev} spectrum, is 2p-periodic in the trivial and topological phases. In the latter it exhibits a clear sawtooth profile at a phase difference of p when the energy splitting is negligible, signalling a strong dependence of current-phase curves on the length of the superconducting regions. Effects of temperature, scalar disorder and reduction of normal transmission on supercurrents are also discussed. Further, we identify the individual contribution of MBSs. In short junctions the MBSs determine the current-phase curves, while in long junctions the spectrum above the gap (quasi-continuum) introduces an important contribution.},

This is done by probing the relation between the {Josephson} current and the superconducting phase difference of a carbon nanotube junction whose Kondo energy and superconducting gap are of comparable size. It exhibits distinctively anharmonic behavior, revealing a phase-mediated singlet-to-doublet transition. We obtain an excellent quantitative agreement with numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo calculations. This provides strong support that we indeed observed the finite-temperature signatures of the phase-controlled zero temperature level crossing transition originating from strong local electronic correlations.},

  abstract      = {In a $\pi$-Josephson junction, the supercurrent's sign is reversed due to the dephasing of superconducting pairs upon their traversal of the nonsuperconducting part. 0-$\pi$ quantum transitions are extremely sensitive to electronic and magnetic correlations, providing powerful exploration tools of competing orders. In a quantum dot connected to superconducting reservoirs, the transition is governed by gate voltage. As shown recently, it can also be controlled by the superconducting phase in the case of strong competition between the superconducting proximity effect and Kondo correlations. We investigated here the current-phase relation in a clean carbon nanotube quantum dot, close to orbital degeneracy, in a regime of strong competition between local electronic correlations and superconducting proximity effect. We show that the nature of the transition depends crucially on the occupation and the width of the orbital levels, which determine their respective contribution to transport. When the transport of Cooper pairs takes place through only one of these levels, we find that the phase diagram of the phase-dependent 0-$\pi$ transition is a universal characteristic of a discontinuous level-crossing quantum transition at zero temperature. In the case where the two levels are involved, the nanotube {Josephson} current exhibits a continuous 0-$\pi$ transition, independent of the superconducting phase, revealing a different physical mechanism of the transition.},

  abstract = {We investigate two serially aligned quantum dots in the molecular regime of large tunnel couplings t. A Zeeman field B is used to tune the energy difference of singlet and triplet spin configurations. Attaching this geometry to BCS source and drain leads with gap $\Delta$ and phase difference $\phi$ gives rise to an equilibrium supercurrent J. To compute J in the presence of Coulomb interactions U between the dot electrons, we employ the functional renormalization group (FRG). For B≈t, where the singlet and (one out of a) triplet spin states are equal in energy, the current exhibits characteristics of a 0-$\pi$ transition similar to a single impurity. Its magnitude in the $\pi$ phase, however, jumps discontinuously at B=t, being smaller on the triplet side. By exploiting the flexibility of the FRG, we demonstrate that this effect is generic and calculate J for realistic experimental parameters $\Delta$, U, and gate voltages $\epsilon$. To obtain a more thorough understanding of the discontinuity, we analytically treat the limit $\Delta$=∞, where one can access the exact many-particle states. Finally, carrying out perturbation theory in the dot-lead couplings substantiates the intuitive picture that Cooper-pair tunneling is favored by a singlet spin configuration while inhibited by a triplet one. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

This material combination allows spin degeneracy to be lifted without destroying superconductivity. We show that a spin-split {Andreev} level crossing the {F}ermi energy results in a quantum phase transition to a spin-polarized state, which implies a change in the fermionic parity of the system. This crossing manifests itself as a zero-bias conductance anomaly at finite magnetic field with properties that resemble those expected for {Majorana} modes in a topological superconductor. Although this resemblance is understood without evoking topological superconductivity, the observed parity transitions could be regarded as precursors of {Majorana} modes in the long-wire limit. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

  abstract     = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are not intrinsically superconducting but they can carry a supercurrent when connected to superconducting electrodes 1-4 . This supercurrent is mainly transmitted by discrete entangled electron-hole states confined to the nanotube, called {Andreev} bound states (ABS). These states are a key concept in mesoscopic superconductivity as they provide a universal description of {Josephson}-like effects in quantum-coherent nanostructures (for example molecules, nanowires, magnetic or normal metallic layers) connected to superconducting leads 5 . We report here the first tunnelling spectroscopy of individually resolved ABS, in a nanotube-superconductor device. Analysing the evolution of the ABS spectrum with a gate voltage, we show that the ABS arise from the discrete electronic levels of the molecule and that they reveal detailed information about the energies of these levels, their relative spin orientation and the coupling to the leads. Such measurements hence constitute a powerful new spectroscopic technique capable of elucidating the electronic structure of CNT-based devices, including those with well-coupled leads. This is relevant for conventional applications (for example, superconducting or normal transistors, superconducting quantum interference devices 3 (SQUIDs)) and quantum information processing (for example, entangled electron pair generation 6,7 , ABS-based qubits 8 ). Finally, our device is a new type of d.c.-measurable SQUID. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {We perform microwave spectroscopy of {Andreev} states in superconducting weak links tailored in an InAs-Al (core-full shell) epitaxially grown nanowire. The spectra present distinctive features with bundles of four lines crossing when the superconducting phase difference across the weak link is 0 or $\pi$. We interpret these features as arising from zero-field spin-split {Andreev} states. A simple analytical model, which takes into account the {Rashba} spin-orbit interaction in a nanowire containing several transverse subbands, explains these features and their evolution with magnetic field. Our results show that the spin degree of freedom is addressable in {Josephson} junctions and constitute a first step towards its manipulation.},

  abstract  = {A semiconducting nanowire fully wrapped by a superconducting shell has been proposed as a platform for obtaining {Majorana} modes at small magnetic fields. In this study, we demonstrate that the appearance of subgap states in such structures is actually governed by the junction region in tunneling spectroscopy measurements and not the full-shell nanowire itself. Short tunneling regions never show subgap states, whereas longer junctions always do. This can be understood in terms of quantum dots forming in the junction and hosting {Andreev} levels in the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov regime. The intricate magnetic field dependence of the {Andreev} levels, through both the Zeeman and Little-Parks effects, may result in robust zero-bias peaks-features that could be easily misinterpreted as originating from {Majorana} zero modes but are unrelated to topological superconductivity.},

  abstract     = {When two superconductors are electrically connected by a weak link - such as a tunnel barrier - a zero-resistance supercurrent can flow. This supercurrent is carried by Cooper pairs of electrons with a combined charge of twice the elementary charge, e. The 2e charge quantum is clearly visible in the height of voltage steps in {Josephson} junctions under microwave irradiation, and in the magnetic flux periodicity of h/2e (where h is Planck's constant) in superconducting quantum interference devices. Here we study supercurrents through a quantum dot created in a semiconductor nanowire by local electrostatic gating. Owing to strong Coulomb interaction, electrons only tunnel one-by-one through the discrete energy levels of the quantum dot. This nevertheless can yield a supercurrent when subsequent tunnel events are coherent. These quantum coherent tunnelling processes can result in either a positive or a negative supercurrent, that is, in a normal or a $\pi$-junction, respectively. We demonstrate that the supercurrent reverses sign by adding a single electron spin to the quantum dot. When excited states of the quantum dot are involved in transport, the supercurrent sign also depends on the character of the orbital wavefunctions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract      = {We present a theoretical analysis of the equilibrium {Josephson} current-phase relation in hybrid devices made of conventional s-wave spin-singlet superconductors (S) and topological superconductor (TS) wires featuring {Majorana} end states. Using Green's function techniques, the topological superconductor is alternatively described by the low-energy continuum limit of a Kitaev chain or by a more microscopic spinful nanowire model. We show that for the simplest S-TS tunnel junction, only the s-wave pairing correlations in a spinful TS nanowire model can generate a {Josephson} effect. The critical current is much smaller in the topological regime and exhibits a kink-like dependence on the Zeeman field along the wire. When a correlated quantum dot (QD) in the magnetic regime is present in the junction region, however, the {Josephson} current becomes finite also in the deep topological phase as shown for the cotunneling regime and by a mean-field analysis. Remarkably, we find that the S-QD-TS setup can support ϕ0-junction behavior, where a finite supercurrent flows at vanishing phase difference. Finally, we also address a multi-terminal S-TS-S geometry, where the TS wire acts as tunable parity switch on the {Andreev} bound states in a superconducting atomic contact.},

  abstract  = {Quantum-mechanical effects at the macroscopic level were first explored in {Josephson}-junction-based superconducting circuits in the 1980s. In recent decades, the emergence of quantum information science has intensified research toward using these circuits as qubits in quantum information processors. The realization that superconducting qubits can be made to strongly and controllably interact with microwave photons, the quantized electromagnetic fields stored in superconducting circuits, led to the creation of the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), the topic of this review. While atomic cavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the latter has now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right. Circuit QED allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the quantum level in unprecedented detail. It also plays an essential role in all current approaches to gate-based digital quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. In addition, circuit QED provides a framework for the study of hybrid quantum systems, such as quantum dots, magnons, Rydberg atoms, surface acoustic waves, and mechanical systems interacting with microwave photons. Here the coherent coupling of superconducting qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators focusing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model, its dispersive limit, and the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system are reviewed. Also discussed is coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is necessary for coherent control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also invariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive qubit readout, a central ingredient in almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following an introduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit QED, important use cases of these ideas in quantum information processing and in quantum optics are discussed. Circuit QED realizes a broad set of concepts that open up new possibilities for the study of quantum physics at the macro scale with superconducting circuits and applications to quantum information science in the widest sense.},

  abstract  = {Hybrid nanowires combining semiconductor and superconductor materials appear well suited for the creation, detection, and control of {Majorana} bound states (MBSs). We demonstrate the emergence of MBSs from coalescing {Andreev} bound states (ABSs) in a hybrid InAs nanowire with epitaxial Al, using a quantum dot at the end of the nanowire as a spectrometer. Electrostatic gating tuned the nanowire density to a regime of one or a few ABSs. In an applied axial magnetic field, a topological phase emerges in which ABSs move to zero energy and remain there, forming MBSs. We observed hybridization of the MBS with the end-dot bound state, which is in agreement with a numerical model. The ABS/MBS spectra provide parameters that are useful for understanding topological superconductivity in this system.},

  abstract     = {Short dephasing times pose one of the main challenges in realizing a quantum computer. Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at optimal working points, so-called "sweet spots." This latter approach led to significant improvement of $T_2$ times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et al., Science 296, 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting qubit called the "transmon." Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of {Josephson} energy and charging energy $E_J/E_C$. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge dispersion decreases exponentially with $E_J/E_C$, while its loss in anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full system shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other known channels.},

Quantum information can be manipulated according to a measurement-only protocol, which is facilitated by tunable couplings between {Majorana} zero modes and nearby semiconductor quantum dots. Our proposed architecture designs have the following principal virtues: (1) the magnetic field can be aligned in the direction of all of the topological superconducting wires since they are all parallel; (2) topological T junctions are not used, obviating possible difficulties in their fabrication and utilization; (3) quasiparticle poisoning is abated by the charging energy; (4) Clifford operations are executed by a relatively standard measurement: detection of corrections to quantum dot energy, charge, or differential capacitance induced by quantum fluctuations; (5) it is compatible with strategies for producing good approximate magic states.},

This is achieved by splitting the system into a chain of quantum dots, which are then tuned to the conditions under which the chain can be viewed as an effective Kitaev model, so that it is in a robust topological phase with well-localized {Majorana} states in the outermost dots. The tuning algorithm that we develop involves controlling the gate voltages and the superconducting phases. Resonant {Andreev} spectroscopy allows us to make the tuning adaptive, so that each pair of dots may be tuned independently of the other. The calculated quantized zero bias conductance serves then as a natural proof of the topological nature of the tuned phase.},

  abstract      = {Utilizing dispersive gate sensing (DGS), we investigate the spin-orbit field ($\textbf{B}_{SO}$) orientation in a many-electron double quantum dot (DQD) defined in an InSb nanowire. While characterizing the inter-dot tunnel couplings, the measured dispersive signal depends on the electron charge occupancy, as well as on the amplitude and orientation of the external magnetic field. The dispersive signal is mostly insensitive to the external field orientation when a DQD is occupied by a total odd number of electrons. For a DQD occupied by a total even number of electrons, the dispersive signal is reduced when the finite external magnetic field aligns with the effective $\textbf{B}_{SO}$ orientation. This fact enables the identification of $\textbf{B}_{SO}$ orientations for different DQD electron occupancies. The $\textbf{B}_{SO}$ orientation varies drastically between charge transitions, and is generally neither perpendicular to the nanowire nor in the chip plane. Moreover, $\textbf{B}_{SO}$ is similar for pairs of transitions involving the same valence orbital, and varies between such pairs. Our work demonstrates the practicality of DGS in characterizing spin-orbit interactions in quantum dot systems, without requiring any current flow through the device.},

abstract={Spin qubits in quantum dots define an attractive platform for quantum information because of their compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing, their long coherence times, and the ability to operate above one Kelvin. However, despite demonstrations of SWAP oscillations, the integration of this two-qubit gate together with single-qubit control to create a universal gate set as originally proposed for single spins in quantum dots has remained elusive. Here, we show that we can overcome these limitations and execute a multitude of native two-qubit gates, together with single-qubit control, in a single device, reducing the operation overhead to perform quantum algorithms. We demonstrate single-qubit rotations, together with the two-qubit gates CROT, CPHASE, and SWAP, on a silicon double quantum dot. Furthermore, we introduce adiabatic and diabatic composite sequences that allow the execution of CPHASE and SWAP gates on the same device, despite the finite Zeeman energy difference. Both two-qubit gates can be executed in less than 100 ns and, by theoretically analyzing the experimental noise sources, we predict control fidelities exceeding 99{\%}, even for operation above one Kelvin.},

abstract={Quantum computers are expected to outperform conventional computers in several important applications, from molecular simulation to search algorithms, once they can be scaled up to large numbers---typically millions---of quantum bits (qubits)1--3. For most solid-state qubit technologies---for example, those using superconducting circuits or semiconductor spins---scaling poses a considerable challenge because every additional qubit increases the heat generated, whereas the cooling power of dilution refrigerators is severely limited at their operating temperature (less than 100 millikelvin)4--6. Here we demonstrate the operation of a scalable silicon quantum processor unit cell comprising two qubits confined to quantum dots at about 1.5 kelvin. We achieve this by isolating the quantum dots from the electron reservoir, and then initializing and reading the qubits solely via tunnelling of electrons between the two quantum dots7--9. We coherently control the qubits using electrically driven spin resonance10,11 in isotopically enriched silicon12 28Si, attaining single-qubit gate fidelities of 98.6 per cent and a coherence time of 2 microseconds during `hot' operation, comparable to those of spin qubits in natural silicon at millikelvin temperatures13--16. Furthermore, we show that the unit cell can be operated at magnetic fields as low as 0.1 tesla, corresponding to a qubit control frequency of 3.5 gigahertz, where the qubit energy is well below the thermal energy. The unit cell constitutes the core building block of a full-scale silicon quantum computer and satisfies layout constraints required by error-correction architectures8,17. Our work indicates that a spin-based quantum computer could be operated at increased temperatures in a simple pumped 4He system (which provides cooling power orders of magnitude higher than that of dilution refrigerators), thus potentially enabling the integration of classical control electronics with the qubit array18,19.},

abstract={The greatest challenge in quantum computing is achieving scalability. Classical computing, which previously faced such issues, currently relies on silicon chips hosting billions of fin field-effect transistors. These devices are small enough for quantum applications: at low temperatures, an electron or hole trapped under the gate can serve as a spin qubit. Such an approach potentially allows the quantum hardware and its classical control electronics to be integrated on the same chip. However, this requires qubit operation at temperatures above 1{\thinspace}K, where the cooling overcomes heat dissipation. Here we show that silicon fin field-effect transistors can host spin qubits operating above 4{\thinspace}K. We achieve fast electrical control of hole spins with driving frequencies up to 150{\thinspace}MHz, single-qubit gate fidelities at the fault-tolerance threshold and a Rabi-oscillation quality factor greater than 87. Our devices feature both industry compatibility and quality, and are fabricated in a flexible and agile way that should accelerate further development.},

volume={11},
number={1},
pages={1144},
abstract={While single-shot detection of silicon spin qubits is now a laboratory routine, the need for quantum error correction in a large-scale quantum computing device demands a quantum non-demolition (QND) implementation. Unlike conventional counterparts, the QND spin readout imposes minimal disturbance to the probed spin polarization and can therefore be repeated to extinguish measurement errors. Here, we show that an electron spin qubit in silicon can be measured in a highly non-demolition manner by probing another electron spin in a neighboring dot Ising-coupled to the qubit spin. The high non-demolition fidelity (99{\%} on average) enables over 20 readout repetitions of a single spin state, yielding an overall average measurement fidelity of up to 95{\%} within 1.2{\thinspace}ms. We further demonstrate that our repetitive QND readout protocol can realize heralded high-fidelity (>99.6{\%}) ground-state preparation. Our QND-based measurement and preparation, mediated by a second qubit of the same kind, will allow for a wide class of quantum information protocols with electron spins in silicon without compromising the architectural homogeneity.},

abstract={Semiconductor spins are one of the few qubit realizations that remain a serious candidate for the implementation of large-scale quantum circuits. Excellent scalability is often argued for spin qubits defined by lithography and controlled via electrical signals, based on the success of conventional semiconductor integrated circuits. However, the wiring and interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are completely different from those for classical circuits, as individual direct current, pulsed and in some cases microwave control signals need to be routed from external sources to every qubit. This is further complicated by the requirement that these spin qubits currently operate at temperatures below 100{\thinspace}mK. Here, we review several strategies that are considered to address this crucial challenge in scaling quantum circuits based on electron spin qubits. Key assets of spin qubits include the potential to operate at 1 to 4{\thinspace}K, the high density of quantum dots or donors combined with possibilities to space them apart as needed, the extremely long-spin coherence times, and the rich options for integration with classical electronics based on the same technology.},

abstract={Circuit quantum electrodynamics has proven to be a powerful tool to probe mesoscopic effects in hybrid systems and is used in several quantum computing (QC) proposals that require a transmon qubit able to operate in strong magnetic fields. To address this we integrate monolayer graphene Josephson junctions into microwave frequency superconducting circuits to create graphene based transmons. Using dispersive microwave spectroscopy we resolve graphene's characteristic band dispersion and observe coherent electronic interference effects confirming the ballistic nature of our graphene Josephson junctions. We show that the monoatomic thickness of graphene renders the device insensitive to an applied magnetic field, allowing us to perform energy level spectroscopy of the circuit in a parallel magnetic field of 1T, an order of magnitude higher than previous studies. These results establish graphene based superconducting circuits as a promising platform for QC and the study of mesoscopic quantum effects that appear in strong magnetic fields.},

abstract={The ability to control the quantum state of a single electron spin in a quantum dot is at the heart of recent developments towards a scalable spin-based quantum computer. In combination with the recently demonstrated controlled exchange gate between two neighbouring spins, driven coherent single spin rotations would permit universal quantum operations. Here, we report the experimental realization of single electron spin rotations in a double quantum dot. First, we apply a continuous-wave oscillating magnetic field, generated on-chip, and observe electron spin resonance in spin-dependent transport measurements through the two dots. Next, we coherently control the quantum state of the electron spin by applying short bursts of the oscillating magnetic field and observe about eight oscillations of the spin state (so-called Rabi oscillations) during a microsecond burst. These results demonstrate the feasibility of operating single-electron spins in a quantum dot as quantum bits.},

We specifically use Cryoscope to measure the step response of the dedicated flux control lines of two-junction transmon qubits in circuit QED processors with the temporal resolution of the room-temperature arbitrary waveform generator producing the control pulses. As a first application, we iteratively improve this step response using optimized real-time digital filters to counter the linear-dynamical distortion in the control line, as needed for high-fidelity repeatable one- and two-qubit gates based on dynamical control of qubit frequency.}",
