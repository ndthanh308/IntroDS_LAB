  "abstract": "The notions and certain fundamental characteristics of the proximal and limiting normal cones with respect to a set are first presented in this paper. We present the ideas of the limiting coderivative and subdifferential with respect to a set of multifunctions and singleton mappings, respectively, based on these normal cones. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the Aubin property with respect to a set of multifunctions are then described by using the limiting coderivative with respect to a set. As a result of the limiting subdifferential with respect to a set, we offer the requisite optimality criteria for local solutions to optimization problems. In addition, we also provide examples to demonstrate the outcomes.",
