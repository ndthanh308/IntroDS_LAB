  "abstract": "Coordination of radars can be performed in various ways. To be more resilient radar networks can be coordinated in a decentralized way. In this paper, we introduce a highly resilient algorithm for radar coordination based on decentralized and collaborative bundle auctions. We first formalize our problem as a constrained optimization problem and apply a market-based algorithm to provide an approximate solution. Our approach allows to track simultaneously multiple targets, and to use up to two radars tracking the same target to improve accuracy. We show that our approach performs sensibly as well as a centralized approach relying on a MIP solver, and depending on the situations, may outperform it or be outperformed.",
