We fully discuss the challenges, significance, and potential research directions of 3D human-centric scene understanding in this paper. Specifically, we propose the first related large-scale dataset with rich fine-grained annotations, which can facilitate the research for many 3D tasks and has the potential to boost the development of assistive robots, surveillance, etc. Moreover, we provide benchmarks for various tasks and propose novel methods for human-centric 3D segmentation and human-centric action recognition to facilitate further research.
