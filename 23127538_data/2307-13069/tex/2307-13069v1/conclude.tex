\section{Conclusions}
In this paper we developed WOOD, a general-purpose multi-modal and weakly-supervised OOD detection framework that combines contrastive learning and a binary classifier in a weakly-supervised fashion. To achieve this, we employ  Hinge loss in contrastive learning to maximize the difference in similarity scores between ID and OOD pairs. In addition, we introduced a Feature Sparsity Regularizer to combine important features from the two data modalities in the binary classifier. We also incorporated a new scoring metric to fuse the prediction results from both components. The evaluation results demonstrated that the integration of the binary classifier and contrastive learning can achieve high accuracy in detecting all three anomaly scenarios.
