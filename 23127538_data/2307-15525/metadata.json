  "abstract": "We study the gradient regularity of solutions to measure data elliptic systems with Uhlenbeck-type structure and Orlicz growth. For any bounded Borel measure, pointwise estimates for the gradient of solutions are provided in terms of the truncated Riesz potential. This allows us to show a precise transfer of regularity from data to solutions on various scales.",
