  "abstract": "This paper focuses on investigating generalized relative interior notions for sets in locally convex topological vector spaces with particular attentions to graphs of set-valued mappings and epigraphs of extended-real-valued functions. We introduce, study, and utilize a novel notion of quasi-near convexity of sets that is an infinite-dimensional extension of the widely acknowledged notion of near convexity. Quasi-near convexity is associated with the quasi-relative interior of sets, which is investigated in the paper together with other generalized relative interior notions for sets, not necessarily convex. In this way, we obtain new results on generalized relative interiors for graphs of set-valued mappings in convexity and generalized convexity settings.",
