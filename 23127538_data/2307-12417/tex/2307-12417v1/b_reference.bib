abstract = {As video calls and personal broadcasting become popular, the demand for mobile live streaming over cellular uplink channels is growing fast. However, current live streaming solutions are known to suffer from frequent uplink throughput fluctuations causing unnecessary video stalls and quality drops. As a remedy to this problem, we propose PERCEIVE, a deep learning-based uplink throughput prediction framework. PERCEIVE exploits a 2-stage LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) design and makes throughput predictions for the next 100ms. Our extensive evaluations show that PERCEIVE, trained with LTE network traces from three major operators in the U.S., achieves high accuracy in the uplink throughput prediction with only 7.67% mean absolute error and outperforms existing prediction techniques. We integrate PERCEIVE with WebRTC, a popular video streaming platform from Google, as a rate adaptation module. Our implementation on the Android phone demonstrates that it can improve PSNR by up to 6dB (4x) over the default WebRTC while providing less streaming latency.},

abstract = {The goal of precipitation nowcasting is to predict the future rainfall intensity in a local region over a relatively short period of time. Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.},

abstract = {Client-side video players employ adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms to optimize user quality of experience (QoE). Despite the abundance of recently proposed schemes, state-of-the-art ABR algorithms suffer from a key limitation: they use fixed control rules based on simplified or inaccurate models of the deployment environment. As a result, existing schemes inevitably fail to achieve optimal performance across a broad set of network conditions and QoE objectives.We propose Pensieve, a system that generates ABR algorithms using reinforcement learning (RL). Pensieve trains a neural network model that selects bitrates for future video chunks based on observations collected by client video players. Pensieve does not rely on pre-programmed models or assumptions about the environment. Instead, it learns to make ABR decisions solely through observations of the resulting performance of past decisions. As a result, Pensieve automatically learns ABR algorithms that adapt to a wide range of environments and QoE metrics. We compare Pensieve to state-of-the-art ABR algorithms using trace-driven and real world experiments spanning a wide variety of network conditions, QoE metrics, and video properties. In all considered scenarios, Pensieve outperforms the best state-of-the-art scheme, with improvements in average QoE of 12%--25%. Pensieve also generalizes well, outperforming existing schemes even on networks for which it was not explicitly trained.},

abstract = {Many commercial video players rely on bitrate adaptation logic to adapt the bitrate in response to changing network conditions. Past measurement studies have identified issues with today's commercial players with respect to three key metrics---efficiency, fairness, and stability---when multiple bitrate-adaptive players share a bottleneck link. Unfortunately, our current understanding of why these effects occur and how they can be mitigated is quite limited.In this paper, we present a principled understanding of bitrate adaptation and analyze several commercial players through the lens of an abstract player model. Through this framework, we identify the root causes of several undesirable interactions that arise as a consequence of overlaying the video bitrate adaptation over HTTP. Building on these insights, we develop a suite of techniques that can systematically guide the tradeoffs between stability, fairness and efficiency and thus lead to a general framework for robust video adaptation. We pick one concrete instance from this design space and show that it significantly outperforms today's commercial players on all three key metrics across a range of experimental scenarios.},

abstract = {We study interactive video calls between two users, where at least one of the users is connected over a cellular network. It is known that cellular links present highly-varying network bandwidth and packet delays. If the sending rate of the video call exceeds the available bandwidth, the video frames may be excessively delayed, destroying the interactivity of the video call. In this paper, we present Rebera, a cross-layer design of proactive congestion control, video encoding and rate adaptation, to maximize the video transmission rate while keeping the one-way frame delays sufficiently low. Rebera actively measures the available bandwidth in real-time by employing the video frames as packet trains. Using an online linear adaptive filter, Rebera makes a history-based prediction of the future capacity, and determines a bit budget for the video rate adaptation. Rebera uses the hierarchical-P video encoding structure to provide error resilience and to ease rate adaptation, while maintaining low encoding complexity and delay. Furthermore, Rebera decides in real time whether to send or discard an encoded frame, according to the budget, thereby preventing self-congestion and minimizing the packet delays. Our experiments with real cellular link traces demonstrate Rebera can, on average, deliver higher bandwidth utilization and shorter packet delays than Apple's FaceTime.},

abstract = {Despite the pervasive use of real-time video telephony services, the users' quality of experience (QoE) remains unsatisfactory, especially over the mobile Internet. Previous work studied the problem via controlled experiments, while a systematic and in-depth investigation in the wild is still missing. To bridge the gap, we conduct a large-scale measurement campaign on appname, an operational mobile video telephony service. Our measurement logs fine-grained performance metrics over 1 million video call sessions. Our analysis shows that the application-layer video codec and transport-layer protocols remain highly uncoordinated, which represents one major reason for the low QoE. We thus propose name, a machine learning based framework to resolve the issue. Instead of blindly following the transport layer's estimation of network capacity, name reviews historical logs of both layers, and extracts high-level features of codec/network dynamics, based on which it determines the highest bitrates for forthcoming video frames without incurring congestion. To attain the ability, we train name with the aforementioned massive data traces using a custom-designed imitation learning algorithm, which enables name to learn from past experience. We have implemented and incorporated name into appname. Our experiments show that name outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, improving video quality while reducing stalling time by multi-folds under various practical scenarios.},

abstract = {User-perceived quality-of-experience (QoE) is critical in Internet video applications as it impacts revenues for content providers and delivery systems. Given that there is little support in the network for optimizing such measures, bottlenecks could occur anywhere in the delivery system. Consequently, a robust bitrate adaptation algorithm in client-side players is critical to ensure good user experience. Previous studies have shown key limitations of state-of-art commercial solutions and proposed a range of heuristic fixes. Despite the emergence of several proposals, there is still a distinct lack of consensus on: (1) How best to design this client-side bitrate adaptation logic (e.g., use rate estimates vs. buffer occupancy); (2) How well specific classes of approaches will perform under diverse operating regimes (e.g., high throughput variability); or (3) How do they actually balance different QoE objectives (e.g., startup delay vs. rebuffering). To this end, this paper makes three key technical contributions. First, to bring some rigor to this space, we develop a principled control-theoretic model to reason about a broad spectrum of strategies. Second, we propose a novel model predictive control algorithm that can optimally combine throughput and buffer occupancy information to outperform traditional approaches. Third, we present a practical implementation in a reference video player to validate our approach using realistic trace-driven emulations.},

abstract = {This paper presents Mahimahi, a framework to record traffic from HTTP-based applications, and later replay it under emulated network conditions. Mahimahi improves upon prior record-and-replay frameworks in three ways. First, it is more accurate because it carefully emulates the multi-server nature of Web applications, present in 98\% of the Alexa US Top 500 Web pages. Second, it isolates its own network traffic, allowing multiple Mahimahi instances emulating different networks to run concurrently without mutual interference. And third, it is designed as a set of composable shells, providing ease-of-use and extensibility.We evaluate Mahimahi by: (1) analyzing the performance of HTTP/1.1, SPDY, and QUIC on a corpus of 500 sites, (2) using Mahimahi to understand the reasons why these protocols are suboptimal, (3) developing Cumulus, a cloud-based browser designed to overcome these problems, using Mahimahi both to implement Cumulus by extending one of its shells, and to evaluate it, (4) using Mahimahi to evaluate HTTP multiplexing protocols on multiple performance metrics (page load time and speed index), and (5) describing how others have used Mahimahi.},

In this work, we suggest an alternative approach: rather than presuming that capacity estimation is required, it is perhaps better to begin by using only the buffer, and then ask when capacity estimation is needed. We test the viability of this approach through a series of experiments spanning millions of real users in a commercial service. We start with a simple design which directly chooses the video rate based on the current buffer occupancy. Our own investigation reveals that capacity estimation is unnecessary in steady state; however using simple capacity estimation (based on immediate past throughput) is important during the startup phase, when the buffer itself is growing from empty. This approach allows us to reduce the rebuffer rate by 10-20% compared to Netflix's then-default ABR algorithm, while delivering a similar average video rate, and a higher video rate in steady state.},
