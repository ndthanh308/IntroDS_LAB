  "abstract": "Handwriting recognition is a challenging and critical problem in the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning, with applications spanning a wide range of domains. In this paper, we focus on the specific issue of recognizing offline Arabic handwritten text. Existing approaches typically utilize a combination of convolutional neural networks for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks for temporal modeling, with connectionist temporal classification used for text generation. However, these methods suffer from a lack of parallelization due to the sequential nature of recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, these models cannot account for linguistic rules, necessitating the use of an external language model in the post-processing stage to boost accuracy. To overcome these issues, we introduce two alternative architectures, namely the Transformer Transducer and the standard sequence-to-sequence Transformer, and compare their performance in terms of accuracy and speed. Our approach can model language dependencies and relies only on the attention mechanism, thereby making it more parallelizable and less complex. We employ pre-trained Transformers for both image understanding and language modeling. Our evaluation on the Arabic KHATT dataset demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches for recognizing offline Arabic handwritten text.",
