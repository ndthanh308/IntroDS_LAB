\section{Discussion}

The choice between score and energy parameterisation remains intriguing.
We have added empirical evidence for the argument that the score parameterisation performs well, but the question remains open.
Even if an energy parameterisation can be found which surpasses the performance of a score parameterisation, our contribution is still important since it enables the HM-like correction step for standard diffusion models, the vast majority of which use the score parameterisation.
With our method, large pre-trained diffusion models can be used in compositions, without the need to learn an energy parameterised model from scratch.

Particularly interesting is that our trick of using a curve only containing the score evaluations from the standard HMC method seems to perform just as well as the straight line.
This means that we achieve the correction at practically no extra cost, while the energy parameterisation always require an extra differentiaion to obtain the score.

The score parameterisation is in general not a proper score function, in the sense that the vector field it produces is not guaranteed to be conservative.
This issue is ignored in score-based diffusion and sampling with the estimated score seems to work well in practice.
Likewise, using it for the MH-like correction step proposed in \cite{du2023reduce} for the energy parameterisation and extended to the score parameterisation in our work, seems to achieve better sampling in practice.
