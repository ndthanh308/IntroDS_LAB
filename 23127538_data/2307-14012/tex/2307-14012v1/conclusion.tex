\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a method for extending the reverse diffusion process with MCMC-sampling, based on a MH-like correction step.
Such extended sampling is vital for composition of pre-trained diffusion models.
The MH-like correction was first presented in \cite{du2023reduce}, where it requires a diffusion model parameterised by an energy function.
We propose a method for estimating the energy through numerical integration of the score.
This allows us to retain the more common score parameterisation and still perform the MH-like correction.
Furthermore, it allows us to use any pre-trained diffusion model in model compositions.
We presented an experiment where the score parameterised models performs similarly to the energy parameterisation, perhaps even performing slightly better.
