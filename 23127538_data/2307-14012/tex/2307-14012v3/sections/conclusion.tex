\section{Conclusion}
We have introduced a method for extending the reverse diffusion process with MCMC sampling based on an MH-like correction step computed from the score function. This approach enables improved sampling for composed diffusion models without requiring an energy-based parameterization.

While previous work~\citet{du2023reduce} demonstrated the benefits of MH correction under an energy parameterization, our method instead defines a pseudo-energy difference derived from the score, estimated via numerical integration. This allows us to apply MH-like corrections in the score-based setting—by far the most common in practice—and thereby make use of existing pre-trained diffusion models for composition tasks.

Our method can reuse intermediate evaluations from samplers such as HMC to compute the correction with little to no additional cost. In general, the accuracy of the MH-like correction depends on the numerical integration of the score, which may require more intermediate points as the dimensionality increases. While this can introduce some overhead, energy-based methods incur their own costs, such as differentiating the energy function. In practice, our corrected score-based samplers consistently match the performance of energy-based methods across a range of tasks, making them a practical alternative in settings where score-based models are already available.

Overall, our work extends the applicability of corrected MCMC sampling to the broad class of score-based diffusion models and opens the door to more flexible and modular composition of generative models.
