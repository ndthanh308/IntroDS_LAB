\section{Conclusion}
We have presented a method for extending the reverse diffusion process with MCMC sampling based on an MH-like correction step.
Such extended sampling is vital for the composition of pre-trained diffusion models.
The MH correction was first presented in \cite{du2023reduce}, where it requires a diffusion model parameterised by an energy function.
We propose a method for defining a pseudo-energy difference, which reduces to proper energy differences in the case of a proper score function, and approximating it by numerical integration.
This allows us to retain the more common score parameterisation and still perform the MH-like correction.
Furthermore, it allows us to use any pre-trained diffusion model in model compositions.
MCMC methods that compute internal points, such as HMC, can compute this MH-like correction essentially without any overhead. However, our experiments seem to indicate that the overhead introduced appears to increase with the dimensionality of the diffusion process.
We have also presented experiments where the score-parameterised models achieve results comparable to the energy parameterization, indicating that our defined pseudo-energies, although in principle ill-defined, are sufficient to replicate the results from \cite{du2023reduce} for any diffusion model.
