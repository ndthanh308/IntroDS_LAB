  "abstract": "We present a whole-body model of human metabolism that utilizes a system of organs and blood vessels to simulate the enzymatic reactions. The model focuses on key organs, including the brain, heart and lungs, liver, gut, and kidney, as well as muscle and adipose tissue. The model equations are formulated using stoichiometry and Michaelis-Menten kinetics to describe the enzymatic reactions. We demonstrate how the model can be used to simulate the effects of prolonged fasting and intermittent fasting on selected metabolite concentrations and glucose flux. Furthermore, by simulating intermittent fasting the effect on the carbohydrate, the protein and the lipid storage is examined. We propose this method as a simple and intuitive approach for modeling the human metabolism, which is general, systematic and easy to incorporate. This could have potential applications in PK/PD drug development and in understanding metabolic disorders.",
