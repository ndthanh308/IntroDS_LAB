\section{Failure Cases}
\label{sec:failure}
In this section, we provide some failure cases and investigate possible reasons. We perform the analysis on single-agent predictions on Argoverse, since the miss rate in single-agent prediction is relatively higher than multi-agent predictions on Interaction. We identify three sources of error for failure cases: erroneous data, missing rare behaviors, and inaccurate predictions. 



\boldparagraph{Erroneous Data} The accuracy of the provided input trajectories in the past directly affects the future predictions, since the future predictions are trained to be consistent with the past ones. Thus, defective or unstable history data causes incorrect future predictions as shown in \figref{fig:argo_fail_input_supp}. Moreover, defects in the future steps result in inaccurate evaluations of the predictions~(\figref{fig:argo_fail_output_supp}). Some problems such as id-switch and position-oscillation, resulting in unstable and incorrect ground truth future locations, are addressed in previous works as well~\cite{Ye2021CVPR, Song2021CoRL}. 



Additionally, accurate map information plays an important role in future predictions because it directly affects the reasoning of the model about drivable areas. In the example shown in~\figref{fig:argo_fail_lane_supp}, predictions are intensified on a single mode \ie left turn, because of the missing lane that the ground truth trajectory follows.


\boldparagraph{Missing a Peculiar Mode} Despite the large number of scenarios on Argoverse, some behaviors are less frequently observed such as a u-turn or an abrupt lane change. These behaviors that are rare on the training set cause the model to miss the relevant mode at test time as shown in~\figref{fig:argo_fail_behaviour_supp}.


\boldparagraph{Precision of Predictions} Some predictions result in an error due to a lack of precision in the predicted trajectories despite correctly identifying intention. For example, in~\figref{fig:argo_fail_inaccurate_supp}, all possible paths are covered by the predictions but the difference between the closest endpoint and the ground truth endpoint is higher than the miss rate threshold.
