\section{Qualitative Results}
\label{sec:qual}
In this section, we provide additional qualitative results for both single-agent~(\figref{fig:argo_qual_supp}) and multi-agent~(\figref{fig:interaction_qual_supp}) predictions of ADAPT on Argoverse and Interaction validation sets, respectively.

\boldparagraph{Focus of Attention Heads}
In~\figref{fig:attention_supp}, we visualize attention scores from different MHAB heads that are used to update an agent (red) in scenes from the validation split of the Interaction dataset. The attention scores are gathered from \textbf{AA} and \textbf{LA} modules for agents and lanes, respectively. In the first layer of interaction (the first row), attention heads do not focus on any specific scene elements yet as this is the first step where the agent is informed by the scene. As the agent has no prior information, attending to all scene elements without focusing on any is a reasonable choice in the first layer. On the other hand, in the next layer, each attention head specializes in some part of the map. For example, in the scene given in the upper set of rows, head 2 attends to lanes in the upper left of the map whereas head 4 attends to the upper right lanes. Some \textbf{AA} heads attend only to the agent itself and do not consider any other agents, \eg head 3 and head 4. In the last layer, heads still attend to some specific parts of the map and a subset of the agents. These visualizations confirm that different types of interactions are captured with the multi-head attention blocks of our model.
