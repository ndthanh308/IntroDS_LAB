\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We propose a novel efficient framework for predicting future trajectories in both multi-agent and single-agent settings where switching between the two requires only changing the endpoint prediction head. We propose dynamic weight learning to accurately predict the endpoints of multiple agents in the same scene reference frame. We demonstrate that our model reaches state-of-the-art performance in both single-agent and multi-agent settings without increasing the model size and consequently without sacrificing efficiency in inference time.

An interesting direction for future work might be incorporating stochastic latent variables into the endpoint prediction to improve the uncertainty in future predictions, \eg with separate latent variables for short-term and long-term goals. Another promising direction is learning the temporal dynamics of the scene to understand the relations better and improve efficiency without limiting assumptions of factorized attention. 
Like most of the existing work in trajectory forecasting, we assume the availability of an HD map where the past locations of agents are marked. The effect of imperfect perception on predicting future trajectories needs to be studied in future work to deploy these solutions.
