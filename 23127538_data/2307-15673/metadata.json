  "abstract": "We describe a numerical technique and accompanying open-source Python software package called RydIQule. RydIQule uses a directional graph, relying on adjacency matrices and path-finding to generate a Hamiltonian for multi-level atomic systems. RydIQule then constructs semi-classical equations of motion (Bloch equations) into a tensor which can store an entire simulation consisting of varied system parameters. Using this framework, RydIQule returns solutions significantly faster than typical for interpreted programming languages. RydIQule extends beyond the capabilities of currently-available tools, facilitating rapid development in atomic and Rydberg spectroscopy. To demonstrate its utility, we use RydIQule to simulate a Doppler-broadened Rydberg atomic sensor that simultaneously demodulates five rf tones spanning from 1.7 to 116 GHz. Using RydIQule, this simulation can be solved in several hours on a commercial off-the-shelf desktop computer.",
