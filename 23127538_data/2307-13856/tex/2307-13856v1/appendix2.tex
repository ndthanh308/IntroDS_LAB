\section{Additional Results}
\label{appendix:results}
We provide sample reconstructed images from all considered networks under adversarial attacks.
Figure~\ref{fig:cospgd_attack} shows reconstructed images from GoPro test dataset~\cite{gopro} after the CosPGD attack~\cite{agnihotri2023cospgd} on the models.
Whereas Figure.~\ref{fig:pgd_attack} shows reconstructed images from GoPro test dataset~\cite{gopro} after the PGD attack~\cite{pgd} on the models.


\subsection{Intermediate networks}
In Table~\ref{tab:intermediate} we report the performance of the \emph{Intermediate network} and \emph{Intermediate + ReLU}.
Please note, the performance of the Intermediate network on the clean (unperturbed) samples is marginally lower than that reported by \cite{chen2022simple}.
As \cite{chen2022simple} does not provide the code, pre-trained weights, or training configuration for this intermediate step between the Baseline network and NAFNet, our implementation is limited to the best of our understanding.
