    \caption{Performance of the different considered networks and their counterparts on clean~(unperturbed) GoPro test images. While NAFNet has highest PSNR value, Restormer is slightly better in terms of SSIM. All models slightly suffer from adversarial training when evaluated on clean data, which is to be expected.}
