  "abstract": "Real extreme/intermediate mass ratio inspiral(E/IMRI) systems are likely to contain large accretion disks which could be as massive as the central supermassive black hole. Therefore, contrary to its ideal model, a real E/IMRI system contains a third important component: the accretion disk. We study the influence of these disks on the emitted GW profile and its detectability through proposed LISA observation. We use a semi-relativistic formalism in the Kerr background (Gair & Glampedakis 2006; Barausse & Rezzolla 2008) for the case of transonic accretion flow which is a potential candidate to describe the accretion flows around AGN. The hydrodynamic drag of the disks modified the motion of the companion as a result the emitted wave changes in amplitude and phase. We found that these changes are detectable through the last few years of observation by LISA (in some cases as small as six months) for EMRIs residing within 3 GPc from the detector and for the accretion rate of the primary black hole of the order of $\\dot{M}=1 \\dot{M}_{Edd}$. These choices of parameter values are consistent with real systems. The drag effect and hence the detectability of the emitted GW is sensitive to the hydrodynamical model of the disk. Therefore such observations will help one to identify the nature of the accretion flow and verify various paradigms of accretion physics.",
