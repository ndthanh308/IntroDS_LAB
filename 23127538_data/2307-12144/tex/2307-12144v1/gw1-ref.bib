	abstract = {The upcoming detection of gravitational waves by terrestrial interferometers will usher in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. This will be particularly true when space-based detectors will come of age and measure the mass and spin of massive black holes with exquisite precision and up to very high redshifts, thus allowing for better understanding of the symbiotic evolution of black holes with galaxies, and for high-precision tests of General Relativity in strong-field, highly dynamical regimes. Such ambitious goals require that astrophysical environmental pollution of gravitational-wave signals be constrained to negligible levels, so that neither detection nor estimation of the source parameters are significantly affected. Here, we consider the main sources for space-based detectors - the inspiral, merger and ringdown of massive black-hole binaries and extreme mass-ratio inspirals - and account for various effects on their gravitational waveforms, including electromagnetic fields, cosmological evolution, accretion disks, dark matter, “firewalls” and possible deviations from General Relativity. We discover that the black-hole quasinormal modes are sharply different in the presence of matter, but the ringdown signal observed by interferometers is typically unaffected. The effect of accretion disks and dark matter depends critically on their geometry and density profile, but is negligible for most sources, except for few special extreme mass-ratio inspirals. Electromagnetic fields and cosmological effects are always negligible. We finally explore the implications of our findings for proposed tests of General Relativity with gravitational waves, and conclude that environmental effects will not prevent the development of precision gravitational-wave astronomy.}

Part I discusses the theory of GWs, re-deriving afresh and in a coherent way all the results presented. Both the geometrical and the field-theoretical approach to general relativity are discussed. The generation of GWs is discussed first in linearized theory (including the general multipole expansion) and then within the post-Newtonian formalism. Many important calculations (inspiral of compact binaries, GW emission by rotating or precessing bodies, infall into black holes, etc.) are presented. The observation of GWs emission from the change in the orbital period of binary pulsar, such as the Hulse-Taylor pulsar and the double pulsar, is also explained, and the pulsar timing formula is derived. Part II discusses the principles of GW experiments, going into the detail of the functioning of both interferometers and resonant-mass detectors. One chapter is devoted to the data analysis techniques relevant for GW experiments.}",

abstract = {We linearize the field equations for higher order theories that contain scalar invariants other than the Ricci scalar. We find that besides a massless spin-2 field (the standard graviton), the theory contains also spin-0 and spin-2 massive modes. Then, we investigate the possible detectability of such additional polarization modes of a stochastic gravitational wave by ground-based and space interferometric detectors. Finally, we extend the formalism of the cross-correlation analysis, including the additional polarization modes, and calculate the detectable energy density of the spectrum for a stochastic background of the relic gravity waves that corresponds to our model. For the situation considered here, we find that these massive modes are certainly of interest for direct detection by the LISA experiment.}

abstract="We give here a brief review of the works studying the signatures of accretion disks on the gravitational wave signals generated by extreme mass ratio binary systems of compact objects. An example of such a system is a stellar mass compact star (typically a neutron star or a black hole) orbiting a central super-massive black hole embedded in a massive accretion disk. We particularly focus on the effects produced by hydrodynamic drag of the disk on the orbiting companion and find that the drag effects produced by the disk matter are indeed capable of modifying the companion's motion and, hence, the gravitational wave signal emitted from the system. The nature and significance of the effect depends crucially on the flow parameters of the disk, e.g. velocity, density profiles of the flow. Therefore, on one hand, one needs to incorporate these effects while theoretically modelling the gravitational wave signal emitted from such systems. On the other hand, by studying the emitted gravitational wave signals profile, one could infer about the nature of the accretion disk, which has been, till date, done only by observing the electro-magnetic signals coming from it. This multi-messenger astronomy was for the first time conceived and worked out during our research work.",

abstract = {We discuss the results of long-term hard X-ray monitoring of Galactic black hole candidates 1E 1740.7-2942, GRS 1758-258, Cyg X-1, GX 339-4, and Cyg X-3 with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. The objects divide into two classes. In the first class, exemplified by Cyg X-1, luminosity and spectral hardness evolve simultaneously. In the second class, the relation is more complicated: the softest spectra occur while the count rate is dropping. Most models of accretion, tailored to Cyg X-1, do not predict the second sort of behavior. One interpretation is a simple model with two simultaneous, independent accretion flows: a thin disk and a hot halo. A drop in the accretion rate affecting both flows would propagate through the halo immediately but might take up to several weeks to propagate through the disk. While the inner halo is thus temporarily depleted compared to the disk, a temporary soft state is expected. This picture is supported by the observation that those sources that show delays (1E 1740.7-2942, GRS 1758-258, and GX 339-4) are expected to have low-mass companions, and those that do not (Cyg X-1, Cyg X-3) are known or thought to have high-mass companions. Low-mass companions imply accretion by Roche lobe overflow, with a high specific angular momentum in the accreting material, and therefore a large disk with a long viscous timescale. Wind accretion from massive companions is expected to result in a much smaller disk and thus little viscous delay.}

The spectral variations are explained from the changes in the accretion dynamics; (b) the X-ray time delay between 0.2–2 and 3–10 keV light-curves exhibited zero-delay in 2003, positive delay of 4.71 ± 2.1 ks in 2013, and negative delay of 2.90 ± 1.26 ks in 2014. The delays are explained considering Comptonization, reflection, and light-crossing time; (c) the long-term intrinsic luminosities, obtained using nthcomp, of the soft-excess and the primary continuum show a correlation with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.90. This indicates that the soft-excess and the primary continuum originate from the same physical process. From a physical model fitting, we infer that the soft excess for Ark 120 could be due to a small number of scatterings in the Compton cloud. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that indeed the spectra corresponding to fewer scatterings could provide a steeper soft-excess power law in the 0.2–3 keV range. Simulated luminosities are found to be in agreement with the observed values.}",

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Relativistic outflows (jets) of matter are commonly observed from systems containing black holes. The strongest outflows occur in the radio-loud systems, in which the accretion disk is likely to have an advection-dominated structure. In these systems, it is clear that the binding energy of the accreting gas is emitted primarily in the form of particles rather than radiation. However, no comprehensive model for the disk structure and the associated outflows has yet been produced. In particular, none of the existing models establish a direct physical connection between the presence of the outflows and the action of a microphysical acceleration mechanism operating in the disk. In this paper we explore the possibility that the relativistic protons powering the jet are accelerated at a standing, centrifugally supported shock in the underlying accretion disk via the first-order Fermi mechanism. The theoretical analysis employed here parallels the early studies of cosmic-ray acceleration in supernova shock waves, and the particle acceleration and disk structure are treated in a coupled, self-consistent manner based on a rigorous mathematical approach. We find that first-order Fermi acceleration at standing shocks in advection-dominated disks proves to be a very efficient means for accelerating the jet particles. Using physical parameters appropriate for M87 and Sgr A*, we verify that the jet kinetic luminosities computed using our model agree with estimates based on observations of the sources.}

abstract = {Accretion flows onto compact astronomical sources are likely to be supersonic, and shock waves may therefore be common in such flows. Plasma passing through a shock front will be compressed and heated according to the jump conditions across the shock discontinuity. Shocks in accretion flows may therefore have important consequences for the flow structure and emission characteristics. The equations governing adiabatic (nonradiative) shocks in relativistic plasmas are presented. Relativistically correct equations of state are used that include the effects of radiation pressure and energy density, and pair equilibria are calculated for the postshock flow. Postshock states are determined for accretion flows with typical accretion-driven astronomical sources, and possible dynamics of the postshock flow are suggested. In particular, we find that cool, optically thick accretion flows undergoing shocks may become radiation or pair dominated and that the postshock plasma will likely become optically thin before returning to steady state conditions.}

We find the solution topologies and give special attention to the solutions containing shocks. We draw the parameter space where standing shocks are possible and where the shocks could be oscillating and could produce quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of X-rays observed from black hole candidates. In this model, the extreme locations of the shocks give the upper limits of the QPO frequencies (νQPO) which could be observed. We show that both the viscosity of the flow and the spin of the black hole a increase the QPO frequency while, as expected, the black hole mass reduces the QPO frequencies. Our major conclusion is that the highest observed frequency gives a strict lower limit of the spin. For instance, a black hole exhibiting νQPO∼ 400 and 700 Hz must have the spin parameters of a \\&gt; 0.25 and \\&gt;0.75, respectively, provided viscosity of the flow is small. We discuss the implications of our results in the light of observations of QPOs from black hole candidates.}",

However, this barrier is weakened in presence of viscosity, more so, if there are explicit energy dissipations at the boundary layer itself. We study effects of viscosity and energy dissipation theoretically on the outflow rate and show that, as the viscosity or energy dissipation (or both) rises, the prospect of formation of outflows is greatly reduced, thereby verifying results obtained through observations and numerical simulations. Indeed, we find that in a dissipative viscous flow, shocks in presence of outflows can be produced only if the Shakura–Sunyaev viscosity parameter α is less than 0.2. This is a direct consequence of modification of the Rankine–Hugoniot relation across the shock in a viscous flow, when the energy dissipation and mass-loss in the form of outflows from the post-shock region are included. If we ignore the effects of mass-loss altogether, the standing dissipative shocks in viscous flows may occur only if α \\&lt; 0.27. These limits are tighter than the absolute limit of α = 0.3 valid for a situation when the shock itself neither dissipates energy nor any outflow is formed. We compute typical viscosity parameters required to understand spectral and temporal properties of several black hole candidates such as GX399-4, MAXI J1659-152 and MAXI J1836-194 and find that required α are indeed well within our prescribed limit.}",

In this paper, we show results of rigorous numerical simulations of a transonic flow having vertically varying viscosity parameter (being highest on the equatorial plane) and optical depth dependent cooling processes to show that the flow indeed segregates into two distinct components as it approaches a black hole. The component on the equatorial plane has properties of a standard Keplerian disc, though the flow is not truncated at the innermost stable circular orbit. This component extends till the horizon as a sub-Keplerian flow. This standard disc is found to be surrounded by a hot, low angular momentum component forming a centrifugal barrier dominated oscillating shock wave, consistent with the Chakrabarti–Titarchuk two-component advective flow configuration.}",

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The photons released by the viscosity process in a disk with accretion rate exceeding the Eddington critical value will be trapped and restored as entropy in the accreting gas rather than being radiated from the disk surface, since the advection cooling dominates the diffusion cooling in such a flow. In this paper a self-similar solution of optically thick advection-dominated flow has been obtained. This kind of flow shows some interesting characteristics that differ from both the optically thin advection-dominated disk and the standard disk. Such a flow is thermally stable. The Bernoulli number is not positive in a wide range of parameters unless the viscosity α is extremely small. The shape always stays slim and is independent of the accretion rate (H/r≈1/√5). The gas rotates with sub-Keplerian angular velocity Ω≈ΩK/√5 (for smaller viscosity). The luminosity of the disk weakly depends on the accretion rate, and the maximum luminosity is about 4.0 × 1037 (ergs s-1) (M/M☉) (less than the Eddington luminosity), although the accretion rate is super-Eddington. This provides a method for estimating the mass of a black hole. The validity of this solution has been tested and found to be suitable in most of the accretion disk (within the photon trapping radius). Its potential applications to the saturated accreting systems are pointed out.}
