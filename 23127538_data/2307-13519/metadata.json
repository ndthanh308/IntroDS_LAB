  "abstract": "Logically constrained term rewriting systems (LCTRSs) are a program analyzing formalism with native support for data types which are not (co)inductively defined. As a first-order formalism, LCTRSs have accommodated only analysis of imperative programs so far. In this paper, we present a higher-order variant of the LCTRS formalism, which can be used to analyze functional programs. Then we study the termination problem and define a higher-order recursive path ordering (HORPO) for this new formalism.",
