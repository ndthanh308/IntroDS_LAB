With ChatGPT as a representative, tons of companies have began to provide services based on large Transformers models. However, using such a service inevitably leak users' prompts to the model provider. Previous studies have studied secure inference for Transformer models using secure multiparty computation (MPC), where model parameters and clients' prompts are kept secret. Despite this, these frameworks are still limited in terms of model performance, efficiency, and deployment. To address these limitations, we propose framework \puma\ to enable fast and secure Transformer model inference. 
Our framework designs high quality approximations for expensive functions, such as $\gelu$ and $\softmax$, which significantly reduce the cost of secure inference while preserving the model performance. Additionally, we design secure Embedding and LayerNorm procedures that faithfully implement the desired functionality without undermining the Transformer architecture. \puma\ is about $2\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art MPC framework \mpcformer (ICLR 2023) and has similar accuracy as plaintext models without fine-tuning (which the previous works failed to achieve).  
One more thing, \puma\ can evaluate LLaMA-7B in around 5 minutes to generate $1$ token. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that a model with such a parameter size is able to be evaluated under MPC. \puma\ has been open-sourced in the Github repository of SecretFlow-SPU\footnote{https://github.com/secretflow/spu/blob/main/examples/python/ml/flax\_llama7b/flax\_llama7b.py}.
