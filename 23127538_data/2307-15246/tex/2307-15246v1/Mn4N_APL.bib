abstract = {Mn4N is a typical transition metal nitride with antiperovskite structure. Mn4N films and Mn4N based heterostructures have attracted much attention for potential applications due to their ferrimagnetism, high thermal stability, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and low saturation magnetization. The fascinating physical properties promise a series of novel applications in next-generation electronic, memory and energy-efficient devices. In this review, the progress of Mn4N films and its heterostructures are systematically summarized and discussed. In the 1st part, the various Mn-N compounds with different phases are introduced, and the basic properties of manganese nitrides are emphasized in details, especially for the properties, superiorities and applications in spintronics of Mn4N. The 2nd part summarizes the fabrication methods, structure and physical properties of Mn4N films. Besides, the underlying mechanisms of Mn4N films and other similar materials are briefly reviewed. In the 3rd part, the tunable magnetic properties of Mn4N films are discussed, including the manipulations methods of different Mn4N heterostructures in recent years. The 4th part highlights the physical properties of Mn4N films doped with other metals, including Co, Ni, and other heavy metal elements. The 5th part illustrates the potential applications of Mn4N films based on the physical properties discussed before. Finally, challenges and future prospects for Mn4N films are discussed, which could provide guidance for developing novel applications and designing functional devices.},

The high-quality growth of Mn4N films was confirmed by x-ray $\theta$-2$\theta$, pole figures and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The Mn4N films exhibit ferrimagnetic with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The saturation magnetization of Mn4N films decreases with increasing temperature, following the Bloch's spin wave theory. The resistivity of Mn4N films exhibits metallic conductance mechanism. Debye temperature of Mn4N is estimated to be 85 K. The calculated residual resistivity $\rho$ xx0 of the 78.8 nm-thick Mn4N film is 30.56 $\mu$$\Omega$ cm. The magnetoresistances of Mn4N films display a negative signal and butterfly shape. The sign of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) is positive, which infers that the AMR is dominated by the spin-up conduction electrons. Moreover, the transformation of fourfold to twofold symmetry for AMR and twofold to onefold symmetry for planar Hall resistivity is attributed to tetragonal crystal field effect.},

abstract = {The rare-earth-free ferrimagnet Mn4N has attractive features for spintronics applications, because it possesses a perpendicular magnetization, due to a relatively large magnetic anisotropy constant of ∼105 J m−3 and a small spontaneous magnetization of ∼100 kA m−1, and a large spin polarization (P = 0.8). More crucially, it is possible to reach the magnetic compensation at room temperature, by tuning its constituent elements in compounds such as Mn4−xNixN and Mn4−xCoxN. This is particularly interesting for spin-torque-based spintronics applications, because at the vicinity of the magnetization and=or angular momentum compensation points, the switching currents can be reduced significantly, thereby leading to lower switching energies and higher switching speed. In this review article, we emphasize the importance of epitaxial growth of Mn4N films by comparing the results obtained on two different substrates, MgO(001) and SrTiO3(001). We then present the achievement of ultrafast current-induced domain wall motion (CIDWM) in Mn4N microstrips, and study the magnetic compensations in Mn4−xNixN and Mn4−xCoxN at room temperature, proved by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements. Finally, we offer future prospects for such Mn4N-based compensated ferrimagnets.},

abstract = {Piezomagnetism couples strain linearly to magnetic order, implying that it can produce and control magnetization. However, unlike magnetostriction, which couples magnetization quadratically to strain, it enables bidirectional control of a net magnetic moment. If this effect becomes large at room temperature, it may be technologically relevant, similar to its electric analogue, piezoelectricity. However, current studies of the piezomagnetic effect have been primarily restricted to antiferromagnetic insulators at cryogenic temperatures. Here we report the observation of large piezomagnetism in the antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Mn3Sn at room temperature. This material is known for its nearly magnetization-free anomalous Hall effect. We find that a small uniaxial strain on the order of 0.1% can control both the sign and size of the anomalous Hall effect. Our experiment and theory show that the piezomagnetism can control the anomalous Hall effect, which will be useful for spintronics applications.},

abstract = {Mn4N films have been prepared on the glass substrate by reactive magnetron sputtering, using Mn3N2 as the seed layer. Compared with Mn4N film directly grown on the glass substrate, the crystallinity and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of the Mn4N film with the seed layer are significantly enhanced. By varying the thickness of the Mn3N2 seed layer, the structural and magnetic properties are systematically investigated. It is shown that the seed layer thickness is pivotal in the growth of Mn4N with good crystallinity. The crystallinity of Mn4N first improves with the increase in the layer thickness of Mn3N2, and degrades after an optimal thickness; this is related to the change in the surface roughness of the Mn3N2 layers. The Mn3N2 layer not only promotes the growth of Mn4N film with c-axis orientation, but also provides additional N atoms to the growing surface to prevent Mn4N from being oxidized. This simple method can be used to prepare high-quality Mn4N films on a glass substrate, which show strong PMA and are suitable for spintronics applications.},

abstract = {Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and coercive fields (Hc) are governed by the degree of order of N (S) in ferrimagnetic Mn4N thin films. However, in this study, we observed non-negligible modulation of Hc extending from 10 to 7.5 kOe for three Mn4N films grown at a substrate temperature (Tsub) in the range of 400–500 °C, even with identical S, which has not been discussed to date. The possible mechanisms for this phenomenon were explored by transport properties and fine structural analysis. The results indicated that longitudinal resistivity and anomalous Hall resistivity remain unchanged for three Mn4N films. Conversely, the number of dislocations and in-plane grain size (D) increased, whereas the residual strain ($\epsilon$) decreased with increasing Tsub. This indicates that Hc of the Mn4N film with the same S is sensitive to the variation in dislocations, D and $\epsilon$. Tunable Hc of this type can be effectively applied in magnetic and spintronic devices using ferrimagnetic Mn4N films, because Hc is an important determinant of the thermal stability of magnetization and working power consumption.},

The thin film is prepared by ultra-high vacuum radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. The growth, the structure, and the magnetic properties are investigated. A fully epitaxial VN/Mn4N/VN film with sharp interfaces is formed on the substrate. The Mn4N film has low out-of-plane and in-plane orientation dispersions of about 1° and high N site order degree of 0.88. The lattice of Mn4N film is slightly deformed along the perpendicular direction (c/a = 0.9872) possibly due to accommodation of the lattice mismatch at Mn4N/VN interfaces. The film shows a low saturation magnetization of 85 kA/m (85 emu/cm3) and a strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The present study has shown that introduction of VN underlayer and caplayer is useful for preparation of well-defined Mn4N thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.},

As such, aiming to shed light on the magnetostructural behavior, related to the magnetic ordering and crystalline structure of this type of materials, we studied theoretically, based-on first-principles calculations, the lattice dynamics and spin–phonon coupling in the Manganese-based antiperovskite Mn3NiN, as a prototype in the Mn3BN family. We found a strong spin–lattice coupling by means of the understanding of the phonon-dispersion curves obtained when including the chiral noncollinear magnetic structures. To do so, we highlight the importance of the exchange–correlation scheme selected and its influence on the structural, electronic, magnetic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. Finally, we found two unstable vibrational modes at the M- and R-points when the magnetic ordering is switched to ferromagnetic from the chiral $\Gamma$4g and $\Gamma$5g. These octahedral-associated modes with spin–phonon coupling parameters, $\lambda$, as large as 10.74 cm−1 and −2.53 cm−1 for the R5−, and M2+, respectively. The latter coupling is observed as a key signature of the strong spin–lattice interaction.},

Here we study the modification of the noncollinear triangular ferrimagnetic spin structure of Mn4N by a variety of metallic substitutions Z (Z = Cu — Ge and Ag — Sn) to achieve compensation at room temperature. The noncollinear frustrated 2.35µB moments of Mn on 3c sites of the (111) kagome planes tilt about 20° out-of-plane in Mn4N and are easily influenced by the substitutions on 1a sites, leading to an efficiency of compensation in Mn4-xZxN that increases gradually from group 11 (Cu, Ag) to group 14 (Ge, Sn) with increasing number of valence electrons. Elements from the 5th period are more efficient for compensation than those from the 4th period due to lattice expansion. The manganese site moments analyzed by constrained density functional theory are determined by Z, orbital hybridization, charge transfer and the tilt angle. The Ga compound with compensation at room temperature for x ≈ 0.26 is recommended for high-frequency spintronic applications.},

abstract = {Ferrimagnets are the magnetic materials with the fastest current-induced dynamics reported so far. Among them, rare-earth transition-metal (RE-TM) alloys offer a fertile playground for studying the behavior of multi-sublattice systems with tunable composition and magnetic interactions. This review provides a survey of the magnetic dynamics excited by current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) in RE-TM ferrimagnets coupled to heavy-metal layers. It summarizes the magnetic properties of RE-TM alloys and discusses how interfacial SOTs result in efficient magnetization switching and fast domain-wall motion close to the magnetization and angular momentum compensation points. Recent work shows that the switching is a multiphase process affected by significant stochastic fluctuations. However, strong SOTs results in fast and deterministic sub-ns switching with minimal energy dissipation. In addition, the RE and TM magnetizations can respond asynchronously to SOTs during the reversal. This asynchronous dynamics pinpoints the different strength of the SOTs acting on the two sublattices and challenges the usual assumption of rigid inter-sublattice antiferromagnetic coupling. Overall, the ability to tailor the timescale and reversal mode of RE-TM alloys allows for optimizing the speed of ferrimagnetic spintronic devices and provides insight into the current-induced transfer of angular momentum in systems with synergistic ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions.},

abstract = {The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the magneto-optical effect (MOE) are two prominent manifestations of time-reversal symmetry breaking in magnetic materials. Noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) have recently attracted a lot of attention owing to the potential emergence of exotic spin orders on geometrically frustrated lattices, which can be characterized by corresponding spin chiralities. By performing first-principles density functional calculations together with group-theory analysis and tight-binding modeling, here we systematically study the spin-order dependent AHE and MOE in representative noncollinear AFMs Mn3XN(X=Ga, Zn, Ag, and Ni). The symmetry-related tensor shape of the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (IAHC) for different spin orders is determined by analyzing the relevant magnetic point groups. We show that while only the xy component of the IAHC tensor is nonzero for right-handed spin chirality, all other elements - $\sigma$xy,$\sigma$yz, and $\sigma$zx - are nonvanishing for a state with left-handed spin chirality owing to lowering of the symmetry. Our tight-binding arguments reveal that the magnitude of IAHC relies on the details of the band structure and that $\sigma$xy is periodically modulated as the spin rotates in-plane. The IAHC obtained from first principles is found to be rather large, e.g., it amounts to 359 S/cm in Mn3AgN, which is comparable to other well-known noncollinear AFMs such as Mn3Ir and Mn3Ge. We evaluate also the magnetic anisotropy energy and find that the evolution of spin order is related to the number of valence electrons in the X ion. Interestingly, the left-handed spin chirality could exist in Mn3XN with some particular spin configurations. By extending our analysis to finite frequencies, we calculate the optical isotropy [$\sigma$xx($\omega$)≈$\sigma$yy($\omega$)≈$\sigma$zz($\omega$)] and the magneto-optical anisotropy [$\sigma$xy($\omega$)≠$\sigma$yz($\omega$)≠$\sigma$zx($\omega$)] of Mn3XN. Similar to the IAHC, the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday spectra depend strongly on the spin order. The Kerr rotation angles in Mn3XN are in the range of 0.3 ∼0.4 , which is large and comparable to other noncollinear AFMs like Mn3Pt and Mn3Sn. Our finding of large AHE and MOE in Mn3XN suggests that these materials present an excellent antiferromagnetic platform for realizing novel spintronics and magneto-optical devices. We argue that the spin-order dependent AHE and MOE are indispensable in detecting complex spin structures in noncollinear AFMs.},

Reflection high-energy electron diffraction and out-of-plane X-ray diffraction measurements are taken for each sample in order to determine the in- and out-of-plane strain for each sample. Vibrating sample magnetometry and superconducting quantum interference device measurements, which are performed on the thin and ultrathin films respectively, are used to plot the magnetization of each sample versus both in- and out-of-plane H→-fields and to determine the magnitude of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in these films. Three significant components of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are observed in these films and are attributed to sample strain (1 component) and shape (2 components). Among these components, the most significant component 0.8–4.9 [Formula presented] is identified as a second term of shape anisotropy, which possesses a negative linear relationship with sample thickness over the range from 9 nm to 310 nm. Atomic (magnetic) force microscopy measurements show the presence of a surface localized magnetic polarization (22–82%), which increases with decreasing thickness, when the net magnetizations of the films are zero. The second term of shape anisotropy as well as the surface localized polarization, which each depend on sample thickness, are each regarded as a consequence of Ising domains overlapping out-of-plane in these films.},

The Hall resistivity shows a reversed magnetic hysteresis loop with the magnetic field. The magnitude of the anomalous Hall resistivity sharply decreases with decreasing temperature from 300 K to 150 K. The AHE scaling law in Mn4N films is influenced by the temperature-dependent magnetization, carrier concentration and interfacial scattering. Different scaling laws are used to distinguish the various contributions of AHE mechanisms. The scaling exponent $\gamma$ < 2 for the conventional scaling in Mn4N films could be attributed to the residual resistivity $\rho$xx0. The longitudinal conductivity $\sigma$xx falls into the dirty regime. The scaling of $\rho$AH = $\alpha$$\rho$xx0 + b$\rho$ n xx is used to separate out the temperature-independent $\rho$xx0 from extrinsic contribution. Moreover, the relationship between $\rho$AH and $\rho$xx is fitted by the proper scaling to clarify the contributions from extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms of AHE, which demonstrates that the dominant mechanism of AHE in the Mn4N films can be ascribed to the competition between skew scattering, side jump and the intrinsic mechanisms.},

Mn4N can be doped to have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and a small spontaneous magnetization. However, the origin of the PMA of Mn4N has yet to be fully understood. Here, we investigated the relationship between the ratios of the perpendicular lattice constant c to the in-plane lattice constant a of Mn4N epitaxial thin films (c/a) and the uniaxial magnetic anisotropic constant (Ku) in Mn4N thin films grown on MgO(001), SrTiO3(001), and LaAlO3(001) substrates. The lattice mismatches between Mn4N and these substrates are approximately -6%, -0.1%, and +2%, respectively. All the Mn4N thin films had PMA and in-plane tensile distortion (c/a < 1) regardless of the Mn4N thickness and substrate. Although the magnitude of c/a depended on several factors, such as the Mn4N layer thickness and substrate, we found a strong correlation between c/a and Ku; Ku increased markedly when c/a deviated from 1. This result indicates that the origin of PMA is tensile distortion in Mn4N films; hence, it might be possible to control the magnitude of Ku by tuning c/a through the Mn4N layer thickness and the substrate.},

We experimentally and theoretically investigated the ANE and anomalous Hall effect in sputter-deposited Mn4N films. It was revealed that the observed negative anomalous Hall conductivity ($\sigma$xy) could be explained by two different coexisting magnetic structures, that is, a dominant magnetic structure with high Ku, contaminated by another structure with negligible Ku, owing to an imperfect degree of order of N. The observed transverse thermoelectric power (SANE) of +0.5 $\mu$V/K at 300 K yielded a transverse thermoelectric coefficient ($\alpha$xy) of +0.34 A/(m {\textperiodcentered} K), which was smaller than the value predicted from the first-principles calculation. The interpretation for $\alpha$xy based on the first-principles calculations led us to conclude that the realization of single magnetic structure with high Ku and optimal adjustment of the Fermi level are promising approaches to enhance SANE in Mn4N through the sign reversal of $\sigma$xy and the enlargement of $\alpha$xy up to a theoretical value of 1.77 A/(m {\textperiodcentered} K).},

Here, we studied the magnetic compensation of Mn4 - xNixN epitaxial films by performing x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements at the L2,3 absorption edges of Mn and Ni atoms and compared them with those of Ni3FeN films. The XAS spectrum of the Ni3FeN films exhibits shoulders at approximately 2 eV above the Ni L2,3 main peaks, originating from orbitals hybridization between Ni 3d at face-centered (II) sites and N 2p at body-centered sites. However, such shoulders are not observed at the Ni L2,3 edges of the Mn4 - xNixN films (x = 0.1 and 0.25). These results indicate that the orbitals of Ni atoms do not hybridize with those of N atoms. Hence, Ni atoms preferentially occupy corner (I) sites, where hybridization is weak because of the relatively long distance between Ni at I sites and N atoms. The XMCD signals of Mn and Ni atoms reverse sign between x = 0.1 and 0.25. This shows that the directions of the magnetic moments carried by Mn and Ni atoms are reversed, indicating that the magnetic compensation occurs in the range 0.1 < x < 0.25. In addition, the signs of Mn(I) XMCD signals are opposite to those of Mn(II) and Ni for each composition. Thus, the magnetic moments of Ni atoms are aligned parallel to those of Mn(II) regardless of whether x is below or above the compensation point.},

abstract = {Thin films of Mn4N and related ternary metallic perovskites with perpendicular anisotropy are interesting for spintronics, but their magnetic structures differ from the triangular ferrimagnetism of the bulk. A temperature-independent anomalous Hall conductivity of -90$\omega$-1cm-1 was found in Mn4N films, in addition to the normal temperature-dependent contribution. Based on known spin structures of bulk Mn3ZN compounds and the distance dependence of the Mn-Mn exchange for first- and second-neighbor Mn-Mn pairs, we propose a topological noncollinear spin structure for the Mn4N films with perpendicular anisotropy. The Letter shows how a small change in symmetry of the spin structure can influence the magnetotransport properties of frustrated ferrimagnetic films.},

abstract = {It is widely known that the switching time is determined by the thermal stability parameters and external perturbations such as magnetic field and/or spin polarized current in magnetic nano-structures. Since the thermal stability parameter and switching time are crucial values in the design of spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory, the measurement of the switching time is important in the study of the switching behavior of ferromagnetic nano-structures. In this study, we focus on the distribution of the switching time. Within the limit of a large energy barrier, a simple analytical expression between damping constant and anisotropy field with switching time distribution is obtained and confirmed by numerically solving the Fokker-Planck equation. We show that the damping constant and anisotropy field can be extracted by measuring the full width half maximum of the switching time distribution in the magnetic nano-structure devices. Furthermore, the present method can be applied to not only single nano-structure, but also inhomogeneous nano-structure arrays.},

These studies reveal large and anisotropic values of both the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect and spin Hall effect. The Mn3X materials exhibit a noncollinear antiferromagnetic order which, to avoid geometrical frustration, forms planes of Mn moments that are arranged in a Kagome-type lattice. With respect to these Kagome planes, we find that both the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) are quite anisotropic for any of these materials. Based on our calculations, we propose how to maximize AHC and SHC for different materials. The band structures and corresponding electron filling, that we show are essential to determine the AHC and SHC, are compared for these different compounds. We point out that Mn3Ga shows a large SHC of about 600 (/e)($\Omega$cm)-1. Our work provides insights into the realization of strong anomalous Hall effects and spin Hall effects in chiral antiferromagnetic materials.},

abstract = {The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a well-known fundamental property of ferromagnetic metals, commonly associated with the presence of a net magnetization. Recently, an AHE has been discovered in noncollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) metals. Driven by nonvanishing Berry curvature of AFM materials with certain magnetic space-group symmetry, anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is very sensitive to the specific type of magnetic ordering. Here, we investigate the appearance of AHC in antiperovskite materials family ANMn3(A=Ga,Sn,Ni), where different types of noncollinear magnetic ordering can emerge. Using symmetry analyses and first-principles density-functional theory calculations, we show that with almost identical band structure the nearly degenerate noncollinear AFM $\Gamma$5g and $\Gamma$4g phases of GaNMn3 have zero and finite AHC, respectively. In a noncollinear ferrimagnetic M-1 phase, GaNMn3 exhibits a large AHC due to the presence of a sizable net magnetic moment. In the noncollinear antiperovskite magnets, transitions between different magnetic phases, exhibiting different AHC states, can be produced by doping, strain, or spin transfer torque, which makes these materials promising for novel spintronic applications.},

Our results show that the Mn atoms prefer to align antiferromagnetic configuration in the ground state. Two nonequivalent Mn atoms (NEMAS) are identified in Mn6N octahedral unit. The Mn-3d orbitals with longer Mn-N bond length in the octahedron split into one doublet and three singlets, and the 3d orbitals of other Mn atoms with shorter Mn-N bond length split in five singlets, i.e. the degeneracy is completely relieved. These findings certainly offer an insight into clarifying the magnetic and electronic properties of these antipervoskites.},

The Hall resistivity of Pt/Mn4N bilayers is strongly dependent on temperature, applied current intensity, Mn4N and Pt layer thicknesses. The temperature-dependent sign reversal of anomalous Hall resistivity appears in Pt/Mn4N bilayers, which is dominated by the competition between the magnetic proximity and spin Hall effects.
