  "abstract": "Simulations of magneto-optical Kerr effect in biaxially strained Mn$_4$N are performed using density functional theory and linear response theory. We consider three ferrimagnetic phases, two collinear and one noncollinear, which have been corroborated separately by earlier studies. The simulated spectra are compared to magneto-optical data available in recent literature. A collinear ferrimagnetic phase with a small saturation magentization, a large perpendicular anisotropy, and Curie temperature above 700~K is found to be consistent with the measured spectra. We hypothesise that an admixture of the noncollinear phase, which could explain the lower than predicted net moment and magnetic anisotropy observed experimentally, is also present.",
