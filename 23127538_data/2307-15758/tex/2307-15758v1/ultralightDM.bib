We show that mechanical sensors with masses around or below the milligram scale, operating around the standard quantum limit, would enable novel searches for DM with natural frequencies around the kHz scale. This would complement existing strategies based on torsion balances, atom interferometers, and atomic clock systems.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We compare new maps of the hot gas, dark matter, and galaxies for 1E 0657-56, a cluster with a rare high-velocity merger occurring nearly in the plane of the sky. The X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like gas subcluster just exiting the collision site. A prominent bow shock gives an estimate of the subcluster velocity, 4500 km s-1, which lies mostly in the plane of the sky. The optical image shows that the gas lags behind the subcluster galaxies. The weak-lensing mass map reveals a dark matter clump lying ahead of the collisional gas bullet but coincident with the effectively collisionless galaxies. From these observations, one can directly estimate the cross section of the dark matter self-interaction. That the dark matter is not fluid-like is seen directly in the X-ray-lensing mass overlay; more quantitative limits can be derived from three simple independent arguments. The most sensitive constraint, σ/m &lt; 1 cm2 g-1, comes from the consistency of the subcluster mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster (and universal) value, which rules out a significant mass loss due to dark matter particle collisions. This limit excludes most of the 0.5-5 cm2 g-1 interval proposed to explain the flat mass profiles in galaxies. Our result is only an order-of-magnitude estimate that involves a number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions; stronger constraints may be derived using hydrodynamic simulations of this cluster.}

Evidences from many different directions now all imply that five sixths of the material content of the Universe is in this mysterious form, separate from and beyond the ordinary ‘baryonic’ particles in the standard model of particle physics. Dark matter appears not to interact via the electromagnetic force, and therefore neither emits nor reflects light. However, it definitely does interact via gravity, and has played the most important role in shaping the Universe on large scales. The most successful technique with which to investigate it has so far been the effect of gravitational lensing. The curvature of space–time near any gravitating mass (including dark matter) deflects passing rays of light—observably shifting, distorting and magnifying the images of background galaxies. Measurements of such effects currently provide constraints on the mean density of dark matter, and its density relative to baryonic matter; the size and mass of individual dark matter particles and its cross-section under various fundamental forces.}

They also appear in models of inflation, dark radiation, or even dark energy, and could solve some long-standing astrophysical anomalies. The physics case of these particles has been considerably developed in recent years, and there are now useful guidelines and powerful motivations to attempt experimental detection. Admittedly, the lack of a positive signal of new physics at the high energy frontier, and in underground detectors searching for weakly interacting massive particles, is also contributing to the increase of interest in axion searches. The experimental landscape is rapidly evolving, with many novel detection concepts and new experimental proposals. An updated account of those initiatives is lacking in the literature. In this review we attempt to provide such an update. We will focus on the new experimental approaches and their complementarity, but will also review the most relevant recent results from the consolidated strategies and the prospects of new generation experiments under consideration in the field. We will also briefly review the latest developments of the theory, cosmology and astrophysics of axions and we will discuss the prospects to probe a large fraction of relevant parameter space in the coming decade.}

	abstract = {I review current efforts to measure the mean density of dark matter near the Sun. This encodes valuable dynamical information about our Galaxy and is also of great importance for ‘direct detection’ dark matter experiments. I discuss theoretical expectations in our current cosmology; the theory behind mass modelling of the Galaxy; and I show how combining local and global measures probes the shape of the Milky Way dark matter halo and the possible presence of a ‘dark disc’. I stress the strengths and weaknesses of different methodologies and highlight the continuing need for detailed tests on mock data—particularly in the light of recently discovered evidence for disequilibria in the Milky Way disc. I collate the latest measurements of ρdm and show that, once the baryonic surface density contribution Σb is normalized across different groups, there is remarkably good agreement. Compiling data from the literature, I estimate Σb = 54.2 ± 4.9 M⊙pc−2, where the dominant source of uncertainty is in the H i gas contribution. Assuming this contribution from the baryons, I highlight several recent measurements of ρdm in order of increasing data complexity and prior, and, correspondingly, decreasing formal error bars. Comparing these measurements with spherical extrapolations from the Milky Way’s rotation curve, I show that the Milky Way is consistent with having a spherical dark matter halo at R0 ∼ 8 kpc. The very latest measures of ρdm based on ∼10 000 stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey appear to favour little halo flattening at R0, suggesting that the Galaxy has a rather weak dark matter disc, with a correspondingly quiescent merger history. I caution, however, that this result hinges on there being no large systematics that remain to be uncovered in the SDSS data, and on the local baryonic surface density being Σb ∼ 55 M⊙pc−2. I conclude by discussing how the new Gaia satellite will be transformative. We will obtain much tighter constraints on both Σb and ρdm by having accurate 6D phase space data for millions of stars near the Sun. These data will drive us towards fully three dimensional models of our Galactic potential, moving us into the realm of precision measurements of ρdm.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We measure the Milky Way's rotation curve over the Galactocentric range 4 kpc ≲ R ≲ 14 kpc from the first year of data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. We model the line-of-sight velocities of 3365 stars in 14 fields with b = 0° between 30° ⩽ l ⩽ 210° out to distances of 10 kpc using an axisymmetric kinematical model that includes a correction for the asymmetric drift of the warm tracer population (σR ≈ 35 km s−1). We determine the local value of the circular velocity to be Vc(R0) = 218 ± 6 km s−1 and find that the rotation curve is approximately flat with a local derivative between −3.0 km s−1 kpc−1 and 0.4 km s−1 kpc−1. We also measure the Sun's position and velocity in the Galactocentric rest frame, finding the distance to the Galactic center to be 8 kpc &lt; R0 &lt; 9 kpc, radial velocity VR, ☉ = −10 ± 1 km s−1, and rotational velocity Vϕ, ☉ = 242+10− 3 km s−1, in good agreement with local measurements of the Sun's radial velocity and with the observed proper motion of Sgr A*. We investigate various systematic uncertainties and find that these are limited to offsets at the percent level, ∼2 km s−1 in Vc. Marginalizing over all the systematics that we consider, we find that Vc(R0) &lt; 235 km s−1 at &gt;99 % confidence. We find an offset between the Sun's rotational velocity and the local circular velocity of 26 ± 3 km s−1, which is larger than the locally measured solar motion of 12 km s−1. This larger offset reconciles our value for Vc with recent claims that Vc ≳ 240 km s−1. Combining our results with other data, we find that the Milky Way's dark-halo mass within the virial radius is ∼8 × 1011 M☉.}

SDSS–Gaia is an astrometric catalogue that exploits SDSS data release 9 to provide first epoch photometry for objects in the Gaia source catalogue. We use a version of the catalogue containing 245 316 stars with all phase-space coordinates within a heliocentric distance of ∼10 kpc. We devise a method to assess the significance of halo substructures based on their clustering in velocity space. The two most substantial structures are multiple wraps of a stream which has undergone considerable phase mixing (S1, with 94 members) and a kinematically cold stream (S2, with 61 members). The member stars of S1 have a median position of (X, Y, Z) = (8.12, −0.22, 2.75) kpc and a median metallicity of [Fe/H] = −1.78. The stars of S2 have median coordinates (X, Y, Z) = (8.66, 0.30, 0.77) kpc and a median metallicity of [Fe/H] = −1.91. They lie in velocity space close to some of the stars in the stream reported by Helmi et al. By modelling, we estimate that both structures had progenitors with virial masses ≈1010M⊙ and infall times ≳ 9 Gyr ago. Using abundance matching, these correspond to stellar masses between 106 and 107M⊙. These are somewhat larger than the masses inferred through the mass–metallicity relation by factors of 5 to 15. Additionally, we identify two further substructures (S3 and S4 with 55 and 40 members) and two clusters or moving group (C1 and C2 with 24 and 12) members. In all six cases, clustering in kinematics is found to correspond to clustering in both configuration space and metallicity, adding credence to the reliability of our detections.}",

journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {Advanced Virgo is the project to upgrade the Virgo interferometric detector of gravitational waves, with the aim of increasing the number of observable galaxies (and thus the detection rate) by three orders of magnitude. The project is now in an advanced construction phase and the assembly and integration will be completed by the end of 2015. Advanced Virgo will be part of a network, alongside the two Advanced LIGO detectors in the US and GEO HF in Germany, with the goal of contributing to the early detection of gravitational waves and to opening a new window of observation on the universe. In this paper we describe the main features of the Advanced Virgo detector and outline the status of the construction.}

keywords = {Gravitational wave detectors, Suspensions, Seismic isolation},
abstract = {Each mirror of the interferometric gravitational wave antenna Virgo is attached to a Superattenuator, a chain of mechanical filters designed to suppress seismic vibrations, starting from a few Hz. The filter chain attenuation has been measured by exciting its suspension point with sinuisodal forces and using the interferometer as sensor. The attenuation, measured at different frequencies, is compliant with the requirements of the next generation antenna Advanced Virgo. In the third generation detector Einstein Telescope, the attenuation is sufficient above 3Hz, independently of the underground site choice.}
