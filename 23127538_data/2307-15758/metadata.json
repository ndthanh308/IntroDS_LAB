  "abstract": "Among several dark matter candidates, bosonic ultralight (sub meV) dark matter is well motivated because it could couple to the Standard Model (SM) and induce new forces. Previous MICROSCOPE and Eot Wash torsion experiments have achieved high accuracy in the sub-1 Hz region, but at higher frequencies there is still a lack of relevant experimental research. We propose an experimental scheme based on the diamagnetic levitated micromechanical oscillator, one of the most sensitive sensors for acceleration sensitivity below the kilohertz scale. In order to improve the measurement range, we used the sensor whose resonance frequency could be adjusted from 0.1Hz to 100Hz. The limits of the coupling constant are improved by more than 10 times compared to previous reports, and it may be possible to achieve higher accuracy by using the array of sensors in the future.",
