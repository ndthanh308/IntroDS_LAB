\section{Appendix organization}
\label{sec:appendix_org}

In this appendix, we provide the supplemental material to the paper: Composite Diffusion:  $whole >= \Sigma parts$. It is organized into the following four main parts:

\begin{description}
    \item [1. Background for methods]
    Appendix-\ref{sec:background} provides the mathematical background for image generation using diffusion models relevant to this paper.

    \item [2. Our base setup and serial inpainting method] 
    Appendix-\ref{sec:experimental_setup} provides the details of our experimental setup, the features and details of the base implementation model, and text-to-image generation through the base model which also serves as our baseline 1. Appendix-\ref{sec:serial_inpainting} provides the details of our implementation of the serial inpainting method which also serves as our baseline 2.

    \item [3. Our method: details and features] Appendix-\ref{sec:our_method_implementation} covers the additional implementation details of our Composite Diffusion method discussed in the main paper. Appendix-\ref{sec:personalizing_at_scale} discusses the implication of Composite Diffusion in personalizing content generation at a scale. Appendix-\ref{sec:limitations} discusses some of the limitations of our approach and Appendix-\ref{sec:societal_impact} discusses the possible societal impact of our work.

    \item [4. Evaluation details] Appendix-\ref{sec:survey_results} provides the additional details of the surveys in the human evaluation, Appendix-\ref{sec:automated_evaluation_methods_details} of the automated methods for evaluation, and Appendix-\ref{appendix_sec:artworks} of the validation exercise with an external artist.
