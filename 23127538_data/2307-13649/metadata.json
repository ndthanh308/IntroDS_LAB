  "abstract": "Thin films have found a wide variety of applications because of the substantial improvement in their properties as compared to bulk metals. Metal oxide thin films are increasingly being used in various fields and are especially important in functional applications. They can be either p- or n-type in nature depending on the materials, dopants, and preparation route. Copper oxide is an example of a p-type metal oxide, which finds application in solar cells, photo-electrochemical cells, gas sensors, supercapacitors, and thermoelectric touch detectors. Both copper (I) and copper (II) oxides can be grown with the lower valence state oxide stable at low temperature and the higher valence state obtained by annealing at higher temperatures. In this work, we modify the optical and electrical properties of copper oxide thin films, by doping of silver through a thermal evaporation process route. Copper is thermally evaporated onto the substrate and silver is co-evaporated during this process. The films are then annealed in ambient under various conditions to obtain copper oxide. Structural and functional comparison is made between undoped and silver doped copper oxide thin films, prepared under the same conditions. Thermal evaporation is a simple route for obtaining doped metal oxides and the process can be extended to a variety of other systems as well.",
