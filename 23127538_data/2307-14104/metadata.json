  "abstract": "We present an estimation of the noise induced by scattered light inside the main arms of the Einstein Telescope (ET) gravitational wave detector. Both ET configurations for high- and low-frequency interferometers are considered, for which we propose baffle layouts. The level of scattered light and the ET laser beam clipping losses are intimately related to the baffle inner aperture. We discuss how this translates into minimum requirements on the vacuum pipe radius, a critical parameter in the ET design. The noise estimations are computed using analytical calculations complemented with numerical tools, and depend on a number of baseline parameters we use as input in the calculations. We conclude that the scattered light noise can be maintained at acceptable levels such that does not compromise the ET performance, provided some requirements are met.",
