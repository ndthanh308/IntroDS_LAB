  "abstract": "We prove that the two point correlation matrix $ \\textbf{M}= (\\langle σ_i ; σ_j\\rangle)_{1\\leq i,j\\leq N} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}$ of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model has the property that for every $ε>0$ there exists $K_ε>0$, that is independent of $N$, such that\n  \\[ \\mathbb{P}\\big( \\| \\textbf{M} \\|_{\\text{op}} \\leq K_ε\\big) \\geq 1- ε\\] for $N$ large enough, for suitable interaction and external field parameters $(β,h)$ in the replica symmetric region. In other words, the operator norm of $\\textbf{M}$ is of order one with high probability. Our results are in particular valid for all $ (β,h)\\in (0,1)\\times (0,\\infty) $ and thus complement recently obtained results in \\cite{EAG,BSXY} that imply the operator norm boundedness of $\\textbf{M}$ for all $β<1$ in the special case of vanishing external field.",
