  abstract = {Negative ions are not accurately represented in density functional approximations (DFAs) such as (semi)local density functionals (LDA or GGA or meta-GGA). This is caused by the much too high orbital energies (not negative enough) with these DFAs compared to the exact Kohn\textendash Sham values. Negative ions very often have positive DFA HOMO energies, hence they are unstable. These problems do not occur with the exact Kohn\textendash Sham potential, the anion HOMO energy then being equal to minus the electron affinity. It is therefore desirable to develop sufficiently accurate approximations to the exact Kohn\textendash Sham potential. There are further beneficial effects on the orbital shapes and the density of using a good approximation to the exact KS potential. Notably the unoccupied orbitals are not unduly diffuse, as they are in the Hartree\textendash Fock model, with hybrid functionals, and even with (semi)local density functional approximations (LDFAs). We show that the recently developed B-GLLB-VWN approximation [Gritsenko et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 144, 204114] to the exact KS potential affords stable negative ions with HOMO orbital energy close to minus the electron affinity.},

The idea is to use the ``constrained-local-density-approximation'' Hubbard parameter U as the quantity relating the single-particle potentials to the magnetic- (and orbital-) order parameters. Our energy functional is that of the local-density approximation plus the mean-field approximation to the remaining part of the U term. We argue that such a method should make sense, if one accepts the Hubbard model and the success of constrained-local-density-approximation parameter calculations. Using this ab initio scheme, we find that all late-3d-transition-metal monoxides, as well as the parent compounds of the high-Tc compounds, are large-gap magnetic insulators of the charge-transfer type. Further, the method predicts that LiNiO2 is a low-spin ferromagnet and NiS a local-moment p-type metal. The present version of the scheme fails for the early-3d-transition-metal monoxides and for the late 3d transition metals.},

Specifically, E[N+P/Q] =~ (1-P/Q)E[N] +~(P/Q)E[N+1]. This paper extends that analysis, showing that the same result holds for irrational numbers of electrons. This proves that the energy is a continuous function of the number of electrons, and justifies differentiation with respect to electron number, providing a rigorous justification or the density-functional theoretic approaches to chemical concepts like the electronegativity and the Fukui function. Similar results hold for properties other than the energy. Specific emphasis is placed on molecular response properties associated with the density-functional theory of chemical reactivity.},

However, in certain situations, popular density-functional approximations (DFAs) have the potential to give substantial quantitative, and even qualitative, errors. The most common class of error is delocalization error, which is an overarching term that also encompasses the one-electron self-interaction error. In our opinion, its resolution remains the greatest outstanding challenge in DFT development. In this paper, we review the history of delocalization error and provide several complimentary conceptual pictures for its interpretation, along with illustrative examples of its various manifestations. Approaches to reduce delocalization error are discussed, as is its interplay with other shortcomings of popular DFAs, including treatment of non-bonded repulsion and neglect of London dispersion.

The electronic energy levels position singlet exciton fission to be endothermic, similar to tetracene despite the triphenylenes. TTBP exhibits rapid early time singlet fission with quantitative yield of triplet pairs within 100\,ps followed by thermally activated separation to free triplet excitons over 65\,ns. TTBP exhibits high photoluminescence quantum efficiency, close to 100\% when dilute and 20\% for solid films, arising from triplet-triplet annihilation. In using such a system for exciton multiplication in a solar cell, maximum thermodynamic performance requires radiative decay of the triplet population, observed here as emission from the singlet formed by recombination of triplet pairs. Combining chemical stabilisation with efficient endothermic fission provides a promising avenue towards singlet fission materials for use in photovoltaics.},

The latter is normally used for open-shell systems because its approximations appear to model better the exchange and correlation (xc) functional, but also because, so far the application of DFT implied a closed-shell-like approximation. In the first part of this Communication, we show that correcting this error for open shells allows the approximate DFT xc functionals to become as accurate as those in SDFT. In the second part, we consider the behavior of SDFT for zero magnetic field. We show that the KS equations of SDFT emerge as the generalized KS equations of DFT in this limit, thus establishing a so far unknown link between the two theories.},

  abstract = {Energy gaps are crucial aspects of the electronic structure of finite and extended systems. Whereas much is known about how to define and calculate charge gaps in density-functional theory (DFT), and about the relation between these gaps and derivative discontinuities of the exchange-correlation functional, much less is known about spin gaps. In this paper we give density-functional definitions of spin-conserving gaps, spin-flip gaps and the spin stiffness in terms of many-body energies and in terms of single-particle (Kohn-Sham) energies. Our definitions are as analogous as possible to those commonly made in the charge case, but important differences between spin and charge gaps emerge already on the single-particle level because unlike the fundamental charge gap spin gaps involve excited-state energies. Kohn-Sham and many-body spin gaps are predicted to differ, and the difference is related to derivative discontinuities that are similar to, but distinct from, those usually considered in the case of charge gaps. Both ensemble DFT and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) can be used to calculate these spin discontinuities from a suitable functional. We illustrate our findings by evaluating our definitions for the Lithium atom, for which we calculate spin gaps and spin discontinuities by making use of near-exact Kohn-Sham eigenvalues and, independently, from the single-pole approximation to TDDFT. The many-body corrections to the Kohn-Sham spin gaps are found to be negative, i.e., single-particle calculations tend to overestimate spin gaps while they underestimate charge gaps.},

Many of these inaccuracies can be traced to the lack of derivative discontinuity that leads to a curvature in the energy with electron addition or removal. Over a dataset of nearly one thousand transition metal complexes typical of VHTS applications, we computed and analyzed the average curvature (i.e., deviation from piecewise linearity) for 23 density functional approximations spanning multiple rungs of ``Jacob's ladder''. While we observe the expected dependence of the curvatures on Hartree-Fock exchange, we note limited correlation of curvature values between different rungs of ``Jacob's ladder''. We train ML models (i.e., artificial neural networks or ANNs) to predict the curvature and the associated frontier orbital energies for each of these 23 functionals and then interpret differences in curvature among the different DFAs through analysis of the ML models. Notably, we observe spin to play a much more important role in determining the curvature of range-separated and double hybrids in comparison to semi-local functionals, explaining why curvature values are weakly correlated between these and other families of functionals. Over a space of 187.2k hypothetical compounds, we use our ANNs to pinpoint DFAs for which representative transition metal complexes have near-zero curvature with low uncertainty, demonstrating an approach to accelerate screening of complexes with targeted optical gaps.},

Similar problems have been observed earlier in classical transition-metal oxides such as FeO, CoO, and NiO. In this work we present the method which delivers the correct insulating antiferromagnet ground state in the correlated oxides preserving other properties as well as the efficiency of the standard LDA. The method embeds the relevant (for a given system of electrons) part of the Hubbard Hamiltonian into the Kohn-Sham LDA equation. The resulting Hamiltonian attempts to fix two intrinsic problems of the LDA: the deficiency in forming localized (atomiclike) moments and the lack of discontinuity of the effective one-particle potential when going from occupied to unoccupied states. We present the detailed study of La2CuO4 and LaCuO3. In the case of La2CuO4 the energy gap and the value of the localized magnetic moment in the stable insulating antiferromagnetic solution are in good agreement with experiment. We compare our results with standard local spin density approximation calculation and multiband Hubbard model calculations, as well as with results of spectroscopy: inverse photoemission, valence photoemission, and x-ray absorption at the K edge of oxygen. In the case of LaCuO3 such an extensive comparison is limited due to the limited data available for this compound. We discuss, however, the electric and magnetic properties and the insulator-metal-insulator transitions upon increase of oxygen deficiency.},

However, such errors can only be characterized sufficiently in terms of those redistributions if exact energies are available for many possible (spin)population redistributions at different bonding distances. In this study, we propose to model such redistributions by imposing (spin)populations on atomic domains by constraining full configuration interaction wave functions. The resulting N-representable descriptions of small hydrogen chains at different bonding distances allow us to computationally illustrate the effects of the flat-plane conditions in the limit to infinite bond distances, leading to more chemical insight into those flat-plane conditions. As the proposed methodology is able to capture the effects of the flat plane conditions, it could be used to generate the reference data that is required to measure the extent to which approximate methods violate the requirements of the exact functional, leading to a quantification of the delocalization and static correlation error of such methods.},

  abstract = {To explore the formation of noncollinear magnetic configurations in materials with strongly correlated electrons, we derive a noncollinear LSDA+U model involving only one parameter U, as opposed to the difference between the Hubbard and Stoner parameters U-J. Computing U in the constrained random phase approximation, we investigate noncollinear magnetism of uranium dioxide UO2 and find that the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) stabilizes the 3k ordered magnetic ground state. The estimated SOC strength in UO2 is as large as 0.73 eV per uranium atom, making spin and orbital degrees of freedom virtually inseparable. Using a multipolar pseudospin Hamiltonian, we show how octupolar and dipole-dipole exchange coupling help establish the 3k magnetic ground state with canted ordering of uranium f orbitals. The cooperative Jahn-Teller effect does not appear to play a significant part in stabilizing the noncollinear 3k state, which has the lowest energy even in an undistorted lattice. The choice of parameter U in the LSDA+U model has a notable quantitative effect on the predicted properties of UO2, in particular on the magnetic exchange interaction and, perhaps trivially, on the band gap: The value of U=3.46eV computed fully ab initio delivers the band gap of 2.11 eV in good agreement with experiment, and a balanced account of other pertinent energy scales.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to advocate the usefulness of the spin-density-functional (SDF) formalism. The generalization of the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham scheme to and SDF formalism is presented in its thermodynamic version. The ground-state formalism is extended to more general Hamiltonians and to the lowest excited state of each symmetry. A relation between the exchange-correlation functional and the pair correlation function is derived. It is used for the interpretation of approximate versions of the theory, in particular the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation, which is formally valid only in the limit of slow and weak spatial variation in the density. It is shown, however, to give good account for the exchange-correlation energy also in rather inhomogeneous situations, because only the spherical average of the exchange-correlation hole influences this energy, and because it fulfills the sum rule stating that this hole should contain only one charge unit. A further advantage of the LSD approximation is that it can be systematically improved. Calculations on the homogeneous spin-polarized electron liquid are reported on. These calculations provide data in the form of interpolation formulas for the exchange-correlation energy and potentials, to be used in the LSD approximation. The ground-state properties are obtained from the Galitskii-Migdal formula, which relates the total energy to the one-electron spectrum, obtained with a dynamical self-energy. The self-energy is calculated in an electron-plasmon model where the electron is assumed to couple to one single mode. The potential for excited states is obtained by identifying the quasiparticle peak in the spectrum. Correlation is found to significantly weaken the spin dependence of the potentials, compared with the result in the Hartree-Fock approximation. Charge and spin response functions are calculated in the long-wavelength limit. Correlation is found to be very important for properties which involve a change in the spinpolarization. For atoms, molecules, and solids the usefulness of the SDF formalism is discussed. In order to explore the range of applicability, a few applications of the LSD approximation are made on systems for which accurate solutions exist. The calculated ionization potentials, affinities, and excitation energies for atoms propose that the valence electrons are fairly well described, a typical error in the ionization energy being 1/2 eV. The exchange-correlation holes of two-electron ions are discussed. An application to the hydrogen molecule, using a minimum basis set, shows that the LSD approximation gives good results for the energy curve for all separations studied, in contrast to the spin-independent local approximation. In particular, the error in the binding energy is only 0.1 eV, and bond breaking is properly described. For solids, the SDF formalism provides a framework for band models of magnetism. An estimate of the splitting between spin-up and spin-down energy bands of a ferromagnetic transition metal shows that the LSD approximation gives a correction of the correct sign and order of magnitude to published X{$\alpha$} results. To stimulate further use of the SDF formalism in the LSD approximation, the paper is self-contained and describes the necessary formulas and input data for the potentials.},

This reparameterization process is based on range-separated functionals with 100\% exact exchange for long-range interelectronic interactions. The functionals developed here, CAM-QTP-02 and LC-QTP, show mitigated self-interaction error, correctly predict vertical ionization potentials as the negative of eigenvalues for occupied orbitals, and provide nice excitation energies, even for challenging charge-transfer excited states. Moreover, some improvements are observed for reaction barrier heights with respect to the other functionals belonging to the quantum theory project (QTP) family. Finally, the most important achievement of these new functionals is an excellent description of vertical electron affinities (EAs) of atoms and molecules as the negative of appropriate virtual orbital eigenvalues. In this case, the mean absolute deviations for EAs in molecules are smaller than 0.10 eV, showing that physical interpretation can indeed be ascribed to some unoccupied orbitals from DFT.},

This deviation causes excess charge delocalization, which leads to incorrect densities, molecular properties, barrier heights, band gaps, and excitation energies. We present a simple delocalization function for characterizing this error and find it to be almost perfectly linear vs the fractional electron number for systems spanning in size from the H atom to the C12H14 polyene. This causes the delocalization energy error to be a quadratic polynomial in the fractional electron number, which permits us to assess the comparative performance of 47 popular and recent functionals through the curvature. The quadratic form further suggests that information about a single fractional charge is sufficient to eliminate the principal source of delocalization error. Generalizing traditional two-point information like ionization potentials or electron affinities to account for a third, fractional charge-based data point could therefore permit fitting/tuning of functionals with lower delocalization error.},

This insulating state results from a fine balance between the tendency of Cu to complete its d-shell and Hund's rule magnetism. Starting from the ground state for the cubic phase, we also study tetragonal distortions of the unit cell (recently reported in experiments) and identify the equilibrium structure.

  abstract = {It is shown that the majority of commonly used exchange-correlation potentials in Kohn-Sham density functional theory describe anions as having only a fraction of the extra electron bound, while the remaining fraction drifts off to infinity when sufficiently flexible basis sets are employed. For systems with both cationic and anionic sites, this leads to fractional electron transfer, even when standard basis sets are used, and thus a qualitative incorrect description of the electronic structure. Exchange functionals without Hartree-Fock exchange display the largest effects, but hybrid functionals also show the phenomenon, except for strongly bound anions. The source of the error is the incorrect long-range behavior of the exchange potential and can be avoided by employing the long-range correction method. The results have consequences for density functional descriptions of systems with localized anionic or strong electron donor sites for almost all of the commonly employed exchange-correlation functionals.},

Three conditions that must be obeyed by the exact energy functional, but may or may not be obeyed by approximate ones, are often pointed out as important in general and for accurate computation of spectroscopic observables in particular. These are: (1) piecewise linearity as a function of the fractional particle number, (2) freedom from one-electron self-interaction, and (3) for a finite system, the functional derivative with respect to the density results in an asymptotic -1/r potential (in Hartree atomic units), where r is the distance from the system center. In this overview, we explain what these conditions are, what they address, and why each one is of importance for spectroscopy. We then show, using specific examples from the literature, that these three properties are related, but are not equivalent and need to be assessed individually.},

We provide a detailed treatment of spin within the linear-response framework, demonstrating that the conventional Hubbard U formula, unlike the conventional DFT+U corrective functional, incorporates interactions that are off-diagonal in the spin indices and places greater weight on one spin channel over the other. We construct alternative definitions for Hubbard and Hund's parameters that are consistent with the contemporary DFT+U functional, expanding upon the minimum-tracking linear-response method. This approach allows Hund's J and spin-dependent U parameters to be calculated with the same ease as for the standard Hubbard U. Our methods accurately reproduce the experimental band gap, local magnetic moments, and the valence band edge character of manganese oxide, a canonical strongly correlated system. We also apply our approach to a complete series of transition-metal complexes [M(H2O)6]n+ (for M=Ti to Zn), showing that Hubbard corrections on oxygen atoms are necessary for preserving bond lengths, and demonstrating that our methods are numerically well behaved even for near-filled subspaces such as in zinc. However, spectroscopic properties appear to be beyond the reach of standard DFT+U. Collectively, these results shed new light on the role of spin in the calculation of the corrective parameters U and J, and point the way toward avenues for further development of DFT+U and related methods.},

  abstract = {In the framework of density functional theory (DFT), the lowest triplet excited state (T1) can be evaluated using multiple formulations, the most straightforward of which are unrestricted density functional theory (UDFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). Assuming the exact exchange\textendash correlation (XC) functional is applied, UDFT and TDDFT provide identical energies for T1 (ET), which is also a constraint that we require our XC functionals to obey. However, this condition is not satisfied by most of the popular XC functionals, leading to inaccurate predictions of low-lying, spectroscopically and photochemically important excited states, such as T1 and the lowest singlet excited state (S1). Inspired by the optimal tuning strategy for frontier orbital energies [T. Stein, L. Kronik, and R. Baer, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 2818], we proposed a novel and nonempirical prescription of constructing an XC functional in which the agreement between UDFT and TDDFT in ET is strictly enforced. Referred to as ``triplet tuning'', our procedure allows us to formulate the XC functional on a case-by-case basis, using the molecular structure as the exclusive input, without fitting to any experimental data. The first triplet tuned XC functional, TT-{$\omega$}PBEh, is formulated as a long-range-corrected (LRC) hybrid of Perdew\textendash Burke\textendash Ernzerhof (PBE) and Hartree\textendash Fock (HF) functionals [M. A. Rohrdanz, K. M. Martins, and J. M. Herbert, J. Chem. Phys. 2009, 130, 054112] and tested on four sets of large organic molecules. Compared to existing functionals, TT-{$\omega$}PBEh manages to provide more accurate predictions for key spectroscopic and photochemical observables, including but not limited to ET, the optical band gap (ES), the singlet\textendash triplet gap ({$\Delta$}EST), and the vertical ionization potential (I{$\perp$}), as it adjusts the effective electron\textendash hole interactions to arrive at the correct excitation energies. This promising triplet tuning scheme can be applied to a broad range of systems that were notorious in DFT for being extremely challenging.},

  abstract = {ConspectusIn recent years, purely organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has aroused wide concern and promotes the development of the supramolecular phosphorescence. Different from organic crystallization, polymerization, or matrix rigidification, supramolecular strategy mainly takes advantage of the synergy between supramolecular co-assembly and strong binding by macrocyclic host compounds (cucurbit[n]urils, cyclodextrins, etc.) to overcome deficiencies such as poor processability and water solubility and improves RTP materials' quantum efficiency and lifetime in the solid state or in an aqueous solution. Meanwhile, it expands application, especially in aqueous solution, in cell imaging. Therefore, supramolecular phosphorescence will become a new growth point and will have broad application prospects in chemistry, biology, and material science.This Account focuses on the uniquely synergetic advantages of co-assembly and host\textendash guest interaction from macrocyclic hosts for enhancing RTP. This Account starts with a brief introduction of the recent development of organic RTP materials as well as the host\textendash guest interaction and co-assembly. Then, we introduce a supramolecular solid-state RTP strategy involving an ultrahigh phosphorescent quantum yield via the tight encapsulation of macrocyclic host cucurbit[6]uril, an ultralong lifetime via changing the substituents of phosphors, and long-lived and bright RTP by the synergy of host\textendash guest interaction and polymerization. Meanwhile, the applications of solid-state RTP materials for anti-counterfeiting and data encryption are presented. The third part will be the water-phase supramolecular phosphorescence systems constructed by water-soluble macrocyclic host cucurbit[8]uril. Host\textendash guest interaction and polymerization worked together toward efficient phosphorescence in aqueous solution, and the multi-stage assembly promoted phosphorescent applications such as cell targeted imaging and energy transfer. A humidity sensor and data encryption by the conversion of supramolecular hydrogels and xerogels are also involved. In the summary section, we present perspectives and possible research directions for supramolecular phosphorescence.Furthermore, on the basis of previous research, we would like to conclude and propose the developing concept of ``macrocycles enhance guest's phosphorescence'', and this concept not only means that the macrocyclic host limits the movement of the guest compound or promotes interactions between guest compounds but also involves the synergetic enhancement centered on macrocyclic compounds via multi-stage supramolecular assembly which further improves the efficiency of RTP, water solubility, and biocompatibility. And we believe that this concept will be able, together with theory of ``assembly-induced emission'' and ``aggregation-induced emission'', to accelerate the development of purely organic RTP materials.},

A variety of crystal-chemical information is extractable from fractional coordinates, occupancies and oxidation states of sites. Volumetric data such as electron and nuclear densities, Patterson functions, and wavefunctions are displayed as isosurfaces, bird's-eye views and two-dimensional maps. Isosurfaces can be colored according to other physical quantities. Translucent isosurfaces and/or slices can be overlapped with a structural model. Collaboration with external programs enables the user to locate bonds and bond angles in the `graphics area', simulate powder diffraction patterns, and calculate site potentials and Madelung energies. Electron densities determined experimentally are convertible into their Laplacians and electronic energy densities.},

  abstract = {The derivative discontinuity is a key concept in electronic structure theory in general and density functional theory in particular. The electronic energy of a quantum system exhibits derivative discontinuities with respect to different degrees of freedom that are a consequence of the integer nature of electrons. The classical understanding refers to the derivative discontinuity of the total energy as a function of the total number of electrons (N), but it can also manifest at constant N. Examples are shown in models including several hydrogen systems with varying numbers of electrons or nuclear charge (Z), as well as the 1-dimensional Hubbard model (1DHM). Two sides of the problem are investigated: first, the failure of currently used approximate exchange\textendash correlation functionals in DFT and, second, the importance of the derivative discontinuity in the exact electronic structure of molecules, as revealed by full configuration interaction (FCI). Currently, all approximate functionals, including hybrids, miss the derivative discontinuity, leading to basic errors that can be seen in many ways: from the complete failure to give the total energy of H2 and H2+, to the missing gap in Mott insulators such as stretched H2 and the thermodynamic limit of the 1DHM, or a qualitatively incorrect density in the HZ molecule with two electrons and incorrect electron transfer processes. Description of the exact particle behaviour of electrons is emphasised, which is key to many important physical processes in real systems, especially those involving electron transfer, and offers a challenge for the development of new exchange\textendash correlation functionals.},

However, these recent one-electron SIE-free functionals, while greatly improving the description of thermochemistry and reaction barriers in general, still exhibit many of the difficulties associated with SIE. Thus we emphasize the need to surpass this limit and shed light on the many-electron SIE. After identifying the sufficient condition for functionals to be free from SIE, we focus on the symptoms and investigate the performance of most popular functionals. We show that these functionals suffer from many-electron SIE. Finally, we give a SIE classification of density functionals.},

Defining \$U\$ as an implicit functional of the ground-state density implies the comparability of DFT + Hubbard \$U\$ (DFT+\$U\$) total-energies, and related properties, as external parameters such as ionic positions are varied together with their corresponding first-principles \$U\$ values. Our approach provides a framework in which to address the partially unresolved question of self-consistency over \$U\$, for which plausible schemes have been proposed, and to precisely define the energy associated with subspace many-body self-interaction error. We demonstrate that DFT+\$U\$ precisely corrects the total energy for self-interaction error under ideal conditions, but only if a simple self-consistency condition is applied. Such parameters also promote to first-principles a recently proposed DFT+\$U\$ based method for enforcing Koopmans' theorem.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT), in its approximate Kohn-Sham formalism, is a highly-acclaimed computational tool that affords the practical and expeditious calculation of ground-state properties of molecules and solids, often with a very reasonable accuracy. It finds routine application in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biochemistry, where it now contributes in both a descriptive and predictive capacity. It is not, in practice, without systematic errors such as those defined by self-interaction and static correlation. These errors undermine the accurate description of particular systems that are beyond the scope of the approximate exchange-correlation functionals, particularly for those comprising so-called strongly-correlated electrons. The effective treatment of these errors is laid down in a number of formative works now adopted within the canon of Kohn-Sham DFT. Many of the most popular and affordable correction schemes entail the calculation of external parameters to diagnose and treat these pervasive errors on a per-electron basis, such as the DFT+Hubbard U method. A possibility that has not yet been explored, however, is the automation of these correction schemes for the provision of greater efficiency, versatility and comparability between DFT calculations. An automated procedure would enable the correction process to be self-contained, thereby circumventing the need for human input, and establish a standardised approach between the various softwares and electronic systems. Of particular interest is the application in high-throughput materials design, and the comparability of DFT+U total-energies for the calculation of thermodynamical quantities. In this dissertation, we present a comprehensive account of our work in pursuit of this goal. We motivate and describe an efficient self-contained approach for correcting the many-body self-interaction error in strongly-correlated systems from ground-statequantities within the DFT+U framework. Moreover, we implement this procedure in a linear-scaling code, which extends its applicability to large-scale systems. Specifically, we develop a highly accurate variational linear-response approach for calculating the Hubbard U and Hund's J parameters, for which a unique criterion for their self-consistency is identified. Our results demonstrate that this scheme is accurate and versatile, and facilitates the correction of many-body self-interaction error for various systems. Moreover, we propose the novel construction of a generalised DFT+U functional that resolves Koopmans' condition exactly in a one-electron system when supplied with the appropriate self-consistent U value. Our research provides insight into important questions about the practice and consequences of calculating corrective parameters for approximate DFT self-consistently, and opens up several new avenues for future developments.},

Our approach builds upon established findings that Hubbard correction of both the titanium 3d and oxygen 2p subspaces in TiO2, symbolically giving DFT+Ud,p, is necessary to achieve acceptable band gaps using DFT+U. This requirement remains when the first-principles Hund's J is included. We also find that the calculated gap depends on the correlated subspace definition even when using subspace-specific first-principles U and J parameters. Using the simplest reasonable correlated subspace definition and underlying functional, the local density approximation, we show that high accuracy results from using a relatively uncomplicated form of the DFT+U+J functional. For closed-shell systems such as TiO2, we describe how various DFT+U+J functionals reduce to DFT+U with suitably modified parameters, so that reliable band gaps can be calculated for rutile and anatase with no modifications to a conventional DFT+U code.},

  abstract = {How can the fundamental band gap of an insulator be predicted? As a difference of ground-state energies, the fundamental gap seems to fall within the reach of density functional theory, yet the predicted gaps from band structure calculations within the local density approximation (LDA) are about 40\% too small. It is argued here that even the exact Kohn-Sham potential veff(r), which generates the exact density in a self-consistent-field calculation, generates a band structure which underestimates the gap. Within the context of the band gap problem, several recent developments in the density-functional theory of many-electron systems are reviewed: (1) The Langreth-Mehl approximation to the Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation energy and potential, based upon the Langreth-Perdew wavevector analysis of the density gradient expansion. This functional leads to more accurate ground-state energies and densities than those of the LDA with little change in the calculated band structures of solids. (2) The derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy, which is responsible for substantial underestimation of the fundamental gap by even the exact Kohn-Sham potential. (3) The self-interaction correction, which yields accurate gaps in insulators only by virtue of its orbital-dependent potential. (4) The density response function of the uniform electron gas, which suggests that the LDA gives a good estimate of the exact Kohn-Sham potential for a semiconductor with a weak periodic potential. In short, several very different (but admittedly approximate) numerical calculations suggest that most of the error in the LDA fundamental gap would persist in the gap of the exact Kohn-Sham band structure. This error would persist in any attempt to calculate the gap from LDA total energy differences for clusters of increasing size.},

  abstract = {How can the fundamental band gap of an insulator be predicted? As a difference of ground-state energies, the fundamental gap seems to fall within the reach of density functional theory, yet the predicted gaps from band structure calculations within the local density approximation (LDA) are about 40\% too small. It is argued here that even the exact Kohn-Sham potential veff(r), which generates the exact density in a self-consistent-field calculation, generates a band structure which underestimates the gap. Within the context of the band gap problem, several recent developments in the density-functional theory of many-electron systems are reviewed: (1) The Langreth-Mehl approximation to the Kohn-Sham exchange-correlation energy and potential, based upon the Langreth-Perdew wavevector analysis of the density gradient expansion. This functional leads to more accurate ground-state energies and densities than those of the LDA with little change in the calculated band structures of solids. (2) The derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy, which is responsible for substantial underestimation of the fundamental gap by even the exact Kohn-Sham potential. (3) The self-interaction correction, which yields accurate gaps in insulators only by virtue of its orbital-dependent potential. (4) The density response function of the uniform electron gas, which suggests that the LDA gives a good estimate of the exact Kohn-Sham potential for a semiconductor with a weak periodic potential. In short, several very different (but admittedly approximate) numerical calculations suggest that most of the error in the LDA fundamental gap would persist in the gap of the exact Kohn-Sham band structure. This error would persist in any attempt to calculate the gap from LDA total energy differences for clusters of increasing size.},

  abstract = {The exact exchange-correlation potential of Kohn\textendash Sham density functional theory is known to jump discontinuously by a spatial constant as the average electron number, N, crosses an integer in an open system of fluctuating electron number, with important physical consequences for charge transfers and band gaps. We have recently constructed an essentially exact exchange-correlation potential vxc for N electrons (0 {$\leq$} N {$\leq$} 2) in the presence of a~\textendash 1/r external potential, i.e., for a ground ensemble of H+ ion, H atom, and H\textendash{} ion densities. That construction illustrates the discontinuity at N = 1, where it equals IH \textendash{} AH, the positive difference between the ionization energy and the electron affinity of the hydrogen atom. Here we construct the corresponding essentially exact spin-up and spin-down exchange-correlation potentials vxc,{$\uparrow$} and vxc,{$\downarrow$} of the Kohn\textendash Sham spin-density functional theory, more commonly used for electronic structure calculations, for the ground ensemble with most-negative z-component of spin (or equivalently in the presence of a uniform magnetic field of infinitesimal strength). The potentials vxc, vxc,{$\uparrow$}, and vxc,{$\downarrow$}, which vanish as r \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$} (except when N approaches an integer from above), are identical for 0 {$\leq$} N {$\leq$} 1 and for N = 2 but not for 1 {$<$} N {$<$} 2. We find that the majority or spin-down potential has a spatially constant discontinuity at N = 1 equal to IH \textendash{} AH. The minority or spin-up potential has a discontinuity which is this constant in one order of limits, but is a spatially varying function in a different order of limits. This order-of-limits problem is a consequence of a special circumstance: the vanishing of the spin-up density at N = 1.},

  abstract = {We present an overview of the onetep program for linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) calculations with large basis set (plane-wave) accuracy on parallel computers. The DFT energy is computed from the density matrix, which is constructed from spatially localized orbitals we call Non-orthogonal Generalized Wannier Functions (NGWFs), expressed in terms of periodic sinc (psinc) functions. During the calculation, both the density matrix and the NGWFs are optimized with localization constraints. By taking advantage of localization, onetep is able to perform calculations including thousands of atoms with computational effort, which scales linearly with the number or atoms. The code has a large and diverse range of capabilities, explored in this paper, including different boundary conditions, various exchange\textendash correlation functionals (with and without exact exchange), finite electronic temperature methods for metallic systems, methods for strongly correlated systems, molecular dynamics, vibrational calculations, time-dependent DFT, electronic transport, core loss spectroscopy, implicit solvation, quantum mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanical and QM-in-QM embedding, density of states calculations, distributed multipole analysis, and methods for partitioning charges and interactions between fragments. Calculations with onetep provide unique insights into large and complex systems that require an accurate atomic-level description, ranging from biomolecular to chemical, to materials, and to physical problems, as we show with a small selection of illustrative examples. onetep has always aimed to be at the cutting edge of method and software developments, and it serves as a platform for developing new methods of electronic structure simulation. We therefore conclude by describing some of the challenges and directions for its future developments and applications.},

Contemporary functionals undershoot the dissociation of symmetric charged dimers A2+, a simple but stringent test, predict a spurious barrier, and improperly delocalize charges for charged molecular clusters. We extend a functional designed for nondynamic correlation to treat the charge delocalization error by modifying the nondynamic correlation for parallel spins. The modified functional eliminates those problems and reduces the multielectron self-interaction error. Furthermore, its results are the closest to those of CCSD(T) in the whole range of the dissociation compared with contemporary functionals. It correctly localizes the net positive charge in (CH4)n+ clusters and predicts a nearly constant ionization potential as a result. Testing of the SIE4x4 set shows that the new functional outperforms a wide variety of functionals assessed for this set in the literature. Overall, we show the feasibility of treating charge delocalization together with nondynamic correlation.},

Unlike other common XC functionals, we find that SCAN does not overbind the O2 molecule, based on direct calculations of its bond energy and robust agreement between calculated formation enthalpies of main group oxides versus experiments. However, in the case of transition-metal oxides, SCAN systematically overestimates (i.e., yields too negative) oxidation enthalpies due to remaining self-interaction errors in the description of their ground-state electronic structure. Adding a Hubbard U term to the transition-metal centers, where the magnitude of U is determined from experimental oxidation enthalpies, significantly improves the qualitative agreement and marginally improves the quantitative agreement of SCAN+U-calculated electronic structure and lattice parameters, respectively, with experiments. Importantly, SCAN predicts the wrong ground-state structure for a few oxides, namely, Ce2O3, Mn2O3, and Fe3O4, while SCAN+U predicts the right polymorph for all systems considered in this paper. Hence, the SCAN+U framework, with an appropriately determined U, will be required to accurately describe ground-state properties and yield qualitatively consistent electronic properties for most transition-metal and rare-earth oxides.},

In contradiction to experimental observations, GGA predicts the fourfold coordinated zb and wz structures to be energetically favorable in comparison to the sixfold-coordinated rs geometry. The use of the hybrid functional HSE03 improves the energetic stability of the rs structure but still fails to determine the correct ground state of MnO. This deficiency can be overcome by applying the GGA+U method with U{$\greaterequivlnt$}4 eV. The computed total energies are used to fit the nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor exchange coupling constants of a Heisenberg model Hamiltonian. Only for the GGA+U functional with U{$\greaterequivlnt$}4 eV, the coupling constants as well as the resulting critical temperature for the magnetic phase transition are in agreement with measured quantities. Therefore, we conclude that an appropriate treatment of the correlation effects in MnO and similar compounds is necessary not only for the electronic but also for the structural properties.},

However, the DFT+U method in Dudarev's formulation limits the introduced corrections to interactions between the electrons within the same spin channel, whereas interactions between the electrons with opposite spins are still treated using local DFT functional (e.g., Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof). In recent years, the need for correction of these interactions between the electrons with opposite spins has been recognized and additional terms have been added to the Hubbard term to reflect it. Although such extended DFT+U functionals have been proposed, the form of respective Hamiltonian operator, defined as a total energy derivative over density with appropriate treatment of double counting corrections due to additional Hubbard terms, has not been explicitly presented. In this work, we provide an expression for such a type of Hamiltonian, which contains the respective double counting correction contributions. This formulation also allows evaluation of atomic forces, using computational settings discussed herein. In addition, we also introduce adjustments for too narrow theoretical bandgaps, using scissor operator technique. This allows for a greater level of corrections of energetics and magnetic properties of studied transition metal compounds, avoiding possible unphysical overlap between occupied and unoccupied electronic bands.},

Combined with the fractional-charge correction from recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC), a functional, the fractional-spin LOSC (FSLOSC), is proposed. FSLOSC, a correction to commonly used functional approximations, introduces the explicit derivative discontinuity and largely restores the flat-plane behavior of electronic energy at fractional charges and fractional spins. In addition to improving results from conventional functionals for the prediction of ionization potentials, electron affinities, quasiparticle spectra, and reaction barrier heights, FSLOSC properly describes the dissociation of ionic species, single bonds, and multiple bonds without breaking space or spin symmetry and corrects the spurious fractional-charge dissociation of heteroatom molecules of conventional functionals. Thus, FSLOSC demonstrates success in reducing delocalization error and including strong correlation, within low-cost density functional approximation.},

In a recent work by the present authors, explicit expressions for bandgap prediction with all common types of exchange-correlation functionals have been derived without invoking the concept of exchange-correlation energy functional derivative discontinuity at all. We here analyze the two approaches and establish their connection and difference. The present analysis further leads to several important results: (1) The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in DFT has as much meaning in describing electron addition as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in describing electron removal. (2) Every term in the total energy functional contributes to the energy gap because of the discontinuity of the derivative of the density (or density matrix) with respect to the number of electrons, (({$\partial\mathsl{P}\mathsl{s}$}({$\mathbf{r}{'}$},{$\mathbf{r}$}))/{$\partial\mathsl{N}$}){$\mathsl{v}\mathsl{s}$}, at integers. (3) Consistent with the Perdew-Levy-Sham-Schl\"uter conclusion that the exact Kohn-Sham energy gap differs from the fundamental bandgap by a finite correction due to the functional derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy, we show that the exchange-correlation functional cannot be an explicit and differentiable functional of the electron density, either local or nonlocal. The last result is further strengthened when we consider Mott insulators. There, the exact exchange-correlation functional needs to have an explicitly discontinuous (nondifferentiable) dependence on the density or the density matrix. (4) We obtain exact conditions on the derivatives of total energy with respect to the spin-up and spin-down number of electrons.},

  abstract = {High-efficiency blue phosphorescence emission is essential for organic optoelectronic applications. However, synthesizing heavy-atom-free organic systems having high triplet energy levels and suppressed non-radiative transitions\textemdash key requirements for efficient blue phosphorescence\textemdash has proved difficult. Here we demonstrate a simple chemical strategy for achieving high-performance blue phosphors, based on confining isolated chromophores in ionic crystals. Formation of high-density ionic bonds between the cations of ionic crystals and the carboxylic acid groups of the chromophores leads to a segregated molecular arrangement with negligible inter-chromophore interactions. We show that tunable phosphorescence from blue to deep blue with a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 96.5\% can be achieved by varying the charged chromophores and their counterions. Moreover, these phosphorescent materials enable rapid, high-throughput data encryption, fingerprint identification and afterglow display. This work will facilitate the design of high-efficiency blue organic phosphors and extend the domain of organic phosphorescence to new applications.},

After reviewing and extending some earlier observations for an isotropic interaction, the anisotropies are examined more fully and related to use with the local-density approximation or with the LSDA. The total energies of all possible integer configurations of an open f shell are presented for three functionals, where some differences are found to be dramatic. Differences between how the commonly used ``around mean-field'' (AMF) and ``fully localized limit'' (FLL) functionals perform are traced to such differences. The LSDA+U interaction term, when applied self-consistently, usually enhances spin magnetic moments and orbital polarization, and the double-counting terms of both functionals provide an opposing moderating tendency (``suppressing the magnetic moment''). The AMF double-counting term gives magnetic states a significantly larger energy penalty than does the FLL counterpart.},

  abstract = {Piecewise linearity of the energy with respect to fractional electron removal or addition is a requirement of an electronic structure method that necessitates the presence of a derivative discontinuity at integer electron occupation. Semi-local exchange-correlation (xc) approximations within density functional theory (DFT) fail to reproduce this behavior, giving rise to deviations from linearity with a convex global curvature that is evidence of many-electron, self-interaction error and electron delocalization. Popular functional tuning strategies focus on reproducing piecewise linearity, especially to improve predictions of optical properties. In a divergent approach, Hubbard U-augmented DFT (i.e., DFT+U) treats self-interaction errors by reducing the local curvature of the energy with respect to electron removal or addition from one localized subshell to the surrounding system. Although it has been suggested that DFT+U should simultaneously alleviate global and local curvature in the atomic limit, no detailed study on real systems has been carried out to probe the validity of this statement. In this work, we show when DFT+U should minimize deviations from linearity and demonstrate that a ``+U'' correction will never worsen the deviation from linearity of the underlying xc approximation. However, we explain varying degrees of efficiency of the approach over 27 octahedral transition metal complexes with respect to transition metal (Sc\textendash Cu) and ligand strength (CO, NH3, and H2O) and investigate select pathological cases where the delocalization error is invisible to DFT+U within an atomic projection framework. Finally, we demonstrate that the global and local curvatures represent different quantities that show opposing behavior with increasing ligand field strength, and we identify where these two may still coincide.},

Within the structural constraints selected for the AIRSS calculations (specifically, centrosymmetric structures with Z = 4 for zwitterionic m-ABA molecules), the method is shown to successfully generate the two known polymorphs of m-ABA (form III and form IV) that have these structural features. We highlight various issues that are encountered in comparing crystal structures generated by AIRSS to experimental powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data and solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR data, demonstrating successful fitting for some of the lowest energy structures from the AIRSS calculations against experimental low-temperature powder XRD data for known polymorphs of m-ABA, and showing that comparison of computed and experimental solid-state NMR parameters allows different hydrogen-bonding motifs to be discriminated.},

When (case I) the lowest ion state has spin S-1/2 (typically when the neutral molecule has a (less than) half filled open shell), the orbital energy of the highest occupied orbital ({$\varphi$}H), belonging to the open shell with majority spin ({$\alpha$}) electrons, is equal to the ionization energy to this lowest ion state with spin S-1/2:\hphantom{,}{$\epsilon$}H{$\alpha$}=-IS-1/2({$\varphi$}H-1). For lower (doubly occupied) orbitals the ionization {$\varphi$}H-1 leaves an unpaired electron that can couple to the open shell to S{$\pm$}1/2 states: {$\epsilon$}i{$\beta\approx-$}IS+1/2({$\varphi$}i-1) (exact identity for i=H-1),\hphantom{,}{$\epsilon$}i{$\alpha\approx-\lbrace$}[2S/(2S+1)]IS-1/2({$\varphi$}i-1)+[1/(2S+1)]IS+1/2({$\varphi$}i-1)\vphantom\{\}, reducing to a simple average in the case of a doublet ground state (single electron outside closed shells). When the lowest ion state has spin S+1/2 (case II; typically for more than half filled open shells): {$\epsilon$}H{$\alpha$}={$\epsilon$}H{$\beta$}=-IS+1/2({$\varphi$}H-1); for i\&lt;H,\hphantom{,}{$\epsilon$}i{$\beta\approx-$}IS+1/2({$\varphi$}i-1),\hphantom{,}{$\epsilon$}i{$\alpha\approx-\lbrace$}[2S/(2S+1)]IS-1/2({$\varphi$}i-1)+[1/(2S+1)]IS+1/2({$\varphi$}i-1)\vphantom\{\}.

A qualitative justification of the LB procedure is given with a ``strong'' form of the Hohenberg\textendash Kohn theorem. The calculated energies {$\epsilon$}i{$\sigma$} of the occupied KS spin orbitals provide numerical support to the analogue of Koopmans' theorem in spin-density functional theory. In particular, the energies -{$\epsilon$}i{$\beta$} of the minor spin ({$\beta$}) valence orbitals of the considered doublet molecules correspond fairly well to the experimental vertical ionization potentials (VIPs) Ii1 to the triplet cationic states. The energy -{$\epsilon$}H{$\alpha$} of the highest occupied (spin-unpaired) {$\alpha$} orbital is equal to the first VIP IH0 to the singlet cationic state. In turn, the energies -{$\epsilon$}i{$\alpha$} of the major spin ({$\alpha$}) valence orbitals of the closed subshells correspond to a fifty-fifty average of the experimental VIPs Ii1 and Ii0 to the triplet and singlet states. For the Li atom we find that the exact spin densities are represented by a spin-polarized Kohn\textendash Sham system which is not in its ground state, i.e., the orbital energy of the lowest unoccupied {$\beta$} spin orbital is lower than that of the highest occupied {$\alpha$} spin orbital (``a hole below the Fermi level''). The addition of a magnetic field in the -z direction will shift the {$\beta$} levels up so as to restore the Aufbau principle. This is an example of the nonuniqueness of the mapping of the spin density on the KS spin-dependent potentials discussed recently in the literature. The KS potentials may no longer go to zero at infinity, and it is in general the differences {$\nu$}s{$\sigma$}({$\infty$})-{$\epsilon$}i{$\sigma$} that can be interpreted as (averages of) ionization energies. In total, the present results suggest the spin-unrestricted KS theory as a natural one-electron independent-particle model for interpretation and assignment of the experimental photoelectron spectra of open-shell molecules.},

For ground states, the nonuniqueness of B(r{$\rightharpoonup$}) implies the nondifferentiability of the energy functional Ev,B[n,ns] with respect to ns(r{$\rightharpoonup$}). It is shown, on the other hand, that this nonuniqueness allows the existence of the one-sided derivatives of Ev,B[n,ns] with respect to ns(r{$\rightharpoonup$}). Although the N-electron ground state can always be obtained from the minimization of Ev,B[n,ns] without any constraint on the spin number Ns={$\int$}ns(r{$\rightharpoonup$})dr{$\rightharpoonup$}, the Lagrange multiplier {$\mu$}s associated with the fixation of Ns does not vanish even for ground states. {$\mu$}s is identified as the left- or right-side derivative of the total energy with respect to Ns, which justifies the interpretation of {$\mu$}s as a (spin) chemical potential. This is relevant not only for the spin-polarized generalization of conceptual density functional theory, the spin chemical potential being one of the elementary reactivity descriptors, but also for the extension of the thermodynamical analogy of density functional theory for the spin-polarized case. For higher-order reactivity indices, B(r{$\rightharpoonup$})'s nonuniqueness has similar implications as for {$\mu$}s, leading to a split of the indices with respect to Ns into one-sided reactivity descriptors.},

In this study, we use open subsystems to redistribute (spin)charges in the tilted Hubbard model by imposing suitable Lagrange constraints on the Hamiltonian. We computationally recover the flat-plane conditions and quantify the underlying quantum phase transitions using quantum entanglement measures. The resulting entanglement patterns quantify the phase transition that gives rise to the flat-plane conditions and quantify the complexity required to accurately describe charge redistributions in strongly correlated systems. Our study indicates that entanglement patterns can uncover those phase transitions that have to be modeled accurately if the delocalization and static correlation errors of approximate methods are to be reduced.},

All the remaining dimers show only the short-range minimum. The largest effective bond order is obtained for the MoW, with a value of 5.2, that is, a weak sextuple bond. Most of the obtained results are valuable tools to drive future experimental investigations.},

It has no delocalization error with a nearly linear energy behavior for systems with fractional charges, describes van der Waals interactions similarly and thermodynamic properties significantly better than particle-hole RPA, and eliminates static correlation error for single-bond systems. Most significantly, the pp-RPA is the first known functional that has an explicit and closed-form dependence on the occupied and unoccupied orbitals and captures the energy derivative discontinuity in strongly correlated systems. These findings illustrate the potential of including pairing interactions within a density functional framework.},

This so-called hybrid DFT scheme is accurate in many materials, for reasons that are not fully understood. Here we show that a 1/4 fraction of exact exchange plus a 3/4 fraction of density-based exchange is compatible with a correct quantum mechanical treatment of the exchange energy of an electron pair in the unpolarized electron gas. We also show that the 1/4 exact-exchange fraction mimics a correlation interaction between doubly-excited electronic configurations.

An analogous result is also proven for one-body reduced density matrix functional theory. While there are known DFT formulations in which the ground state is not always accessible, indicating that convexity does not hold in such cases, this proof, nonetheless, confirms a stringent constraint on the exact exchange--correlation functional. We also provide sufficient conditions for convexity in approximate DFT, which could aid in the development of density-functional approximations. This result lifts a standing assumption in the proof of the piecewise linearity condition with respect to electron count, which has proven central to understanding the Kohn--Sham bandgap and the exchange--correlation derivative discontinuity of DFT.},

First, we discuss how the building blocks of DFT, namely the Hohenberg--Kohn theorems, the Levy--Lieb approach and the Kohn--Sham method, can be adapted for a description in terms of n {$\alpha$} . In particular, the total energy is now a function of n {$\alpha$} , E[n {$\alpha$} ], and a Kohn--Sham-like Hamiltonian is derived introducing the effects of the electron--electron interactions via effective potentials, . In a second step we consider the Hartree and exchange energies and discuss how to describe them, in the spirit of a DFT approach, in terms of the orbital occupation numbers. In this contribution special attention is paid to the description of the (intra-atomic) correlation energy and corresponding correlation potentials V corr,{$\alpha$} .

The dynamical mean-field portion of the calculation is formulated using maximally localized Wannier functions, enabling a convenient implementation which is independent of the basis set used in the density functional portion of the calculation. The importance of using a correct double-counting term is demonstrated. A generalized form of the standard double-counting correction, which we refer to as the U{$\prime$} form, is described in detail and used. For comparison, the density functional plus U method is implemented within the same framework including the generalized double counting. The formalism is validated via a calculation of the metal-insulator and structural phase diagrams of the rare-earth nickelate perovskites as functions of applied pressure and A-site rare-earth ions.

However, calculating the polarization in large-scale ab-initio molecular dynamics remains prohibitive due to the high computational cost involved. In this work, we introduce a machine-learning formulation that simultaneously learns to predict electric enthalpy, atomic forces, polarization, Born charges, and polarizability for a given atomic configuration. These quantities are derived through differentiation of the electric enthalpy with respect to atomic positions and electric field within a local equivariant representation of the atomic environment. Our new method exactly constrains the polarization to be a conservative vector field, obeys the acoustic sum rule for Born charges, and ensures the conservation of electric enthalpy in machine-learning molecular dynamics. Importantly, the formulation is general and does not necessarily require equivariance. The locality of the model enables the efficient calculation of vibrational and dielectric properties of materials over large length-scale and long time-scale molecular dynamics at quantum-mechanical accuracy. We apply our approach to determine the infrared spectrum and frequency-dependent dielectric constant of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-SiO\$\_2\$ using molecular dynamics, finding excellent agreement with results obtained from density functional perturbation theory. Additionally, we show that our model accurately captures the electric-field contributions to the electric enthalpy, forces, and polarization in reference to density functional theory calculations. This demonstrates the capability of our formulation to perform large-scale molecular dynamics under electric fields, thus paving the way to efficient and accurate studies of dielectric response of complex materials.},

  abstract = {It has recently been shown how to replace spin-wave functions with purely spatial wave functions in the formulation of spin-density functional theory (SDFT), without any change to the resultant density functional expressions [F. Zahariev and M. Levy, Phys. Rev. A 100, 062507 (2019)]. The purely spatial wave functions that are obtained are much more convenient to use and thus allow for a relatively easy decomposition and manipulation of terms in the constrained-search formulation of SDFT. All the essential ingredients of SDFT, including the kinetic, exchange, and correlation contributions, are explicitly defined in terms of the universal functional expressed in this spin-free manner. Constrained-search derivations of the Oliver-Perdew relations for the kinetic and exchange terms are presented. The up-down spin component of the correlation term is found to contain the up-down spin component of the Hartree term. A spin-dependent generalization of the adiabatic connection is put forth and a connection with spin-dependent coordinate scaling is established for the correlation energy.},

  abstract = {The accurate description of open-shell molecules, in particular of transition metal complexes and clusters, is still an important challenge for quantum chemistry. Although density-functional theory (DFT) is widely applied in this area, the sometimes severe limitations of its currently available approximate realizations often preclude its application as a predictive theory. Here, we review the foundations of DFT applied to open-shell systems, both within the nonrelativistic and the relativistic framework. In particular, we provide an in-depth discussion of the exact theory, with a focus on the role of the spin density and possibilities for targeting specific spin states. It turns out that different options exist for setting up Kohn--Sham DFT schemes for open-shell systems, which imply different definitions of the exchange--correlation energy functional and lead to different exact conditions on this functional. Finally, we suggest possible directions for future developments. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
