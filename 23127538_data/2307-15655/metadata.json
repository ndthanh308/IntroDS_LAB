  "abstract": "In this paper we prove existence of solutions to Schrödinger-Maxwell type systems involving mixed local-nonlocal operators. Two different models are considered: classical Schrödinger-Maxwell equations and Schrödinger-Maxwell equations with a coercive potential, and the main novelty is that the nonlocal part of the operator is allowed to be nonpositive definite according to a real parameter. We then provide a range of parameter values to ensure the existence of solitary standing waves, obtained as Mountain Pass critical points for the associated energy functionals.",
