\subsection{Analysis time improvement of static analysis}
\label{sec:evaluation}

This section evaluates \dataset using a recent state-of-the-art tool, Difuzer~\cite{10.1145/3510003.3510135}, which is a static analysis tool to detect suspicious hidden sensitive operations in Android apps, in order to answer \textbf{RQ4}.
Difuzer is designed to filter out libraries for various tasks, and our goal is to assess the impact of our dataset in comparison to the \textbf{comparison\_dataset}. 
Comparing the results of running Difuzer with \dataset with those obtained using the \textbf{comparison\_dataset}, we aim to evaluate our dataset's effectiveness in improving Difuzer's performance.

Difuzer performs instrumentation tasks (it instruments "if" statements for taint analysis purposes) while attempting to focus exclusively on developer code by filtering out libraries using the \textbf{comparison\_dataset} natively. 
To assess the impact of \dataset on Difuzer's performance, we ran the tool over \num{25000} apps randomly chosen from our 2021--2022 dataset in conjunction with both the \textbf{comparison\_dataset} and \dataset, with a timeout of 5 minutes for the analysis.

The results indicate that the number of "if" statements instrumented by Difuzer with \dataset is on average less than half of those instrumented with the \textbf{comparison\_dataset}.
Specifically, the average number of instrumented "if" statements was \num{4764} with \dataset and \num{11523} with the \textbf{comparison\_dataset}. 
Similarly, the median number of instrumented "if" statements was almost divided by ten, with \num{1305} for our dataset and \num{9639} for the \textbf{comparison\_dataset}. 
Furthermore, the instrumentation time was greatly reduced with our dataset as compared to the \textbf{comparison\_dataset}, with an average instrumentation time of 2.9 s and a median of 1 s for \dataset, compared to an average of 5.8 s and a median of 3 s for the \textbf{comparison\_dataset}.
The distributions of the instrumentation time and the number of "if" statements instrumented by Difuzer with both \dataset and \textbf{comparison\_dataset} is visible on Figure~\ref{fig:distrib_difuzer}.
These results indicate that \dataset, as a more comprehensive dataset of third-party libraries, positively impacts the results of Difuzer.

\highlight{
\textbf{RQ4:}
The results obtained by running Difuzer with \dataset compared to the \textbf{comparison\_dataset} demonstrate the utility of our dataset to improve the performance of static analysis tools. 
Difuzer showed a significant reduction in the number of instrumented "if" statements and instrumentation time when using our dataset.
These results highlight the impact of our dataset in improving static analysis of apps.
