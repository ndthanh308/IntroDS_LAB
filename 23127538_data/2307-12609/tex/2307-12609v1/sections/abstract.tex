Android app developers extensively employ code reuse, integrating many third-party libraries into their apps. While such integration is practical for developers, it can be challenging for static analyzers to achieve scalability and precision when such libraries can account for a large part of the app code.
As a direct consequence, when a static analysis is performed, it is common practice in the literature to only consider developer code --with the assumption that the sought issues are in developer code rather than in the libraries.
However, analysts need to precisely distinguish between library code and developer code in Android apps to ensure the effectiveness of static analysis.
Currently, many static analysis approaches rely on white lists of libraries. 
However, these white lists are unreliable, as they are inaccurate and largely non-comprehensive.

In this paper, we propose a new approach to address the lack of comprehensive and automated solutions for the production of accurate and "always up to date" sets of third-party libraries. 
First, we demonstrate the continued need for a white list of third-party libraries.
Second, we propose an automated approach to produce an accurate and up-to-date set of third-party libraries in the form of a dataset called \dataset.
Our dataset, which we make available to the research community, contains to date \libsAfterRefinement libraries and is meant to evolve.
Third, we illustrate the significance of using \dataset to filter libraries in recent apps. 
Fourth, we demonstrate that \dataset is more suitable than the current state-of-the-art list for improved static analysis. 
Finally, we show how the use of \dataset can enhance the performance of existing Android app static analyzers.
