\section{Empirical Investigations}
\label{sec:empirical_investigations}

This section presents the results of several empirical investigations performed to measure the benefit brought by \dataset for static analysis.
In summary, we answer the following research questions:
\begin{description}
    \item[RQ2:] How does \dataset compare with state-of-the-art approaches?
    \item[RQ3:] To what extent can \dataset be useful and effective for Android apps' static analysis?
    \item[RQ4:] Can \dataset improve the analysis performance of existing static analysis tools?
\end{description}
