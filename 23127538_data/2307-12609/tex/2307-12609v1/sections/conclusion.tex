\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented an approach for automatically generating an accurate and up-to-date white list of third-party libraries 
that can serve the research and practitioner communities. 
Our dataset, \dataset, contains \libsAfterRefinement package names which, by construction, only represent libraries, and is meant to evolve.
We demonstrated the importance of such a list and showed that it can significantly reduce the number of statements to consider during analysis and 
speed-up the analysis time of existing static analyzers.
Moreover, we demonstrated that \dataset is more reliable and more comprehensive than the current state-of-the-art list of libraries.  
Overall, our work highlights the importance of considering third-party libraries during static analysis and provides a practical solution for identifying and filtering automatically.
