\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

 In this paper, we presented an approach for automatically generating an accurate and up-to-date white list of third-party libraries 
that can serve the research and practitioner communities. 
Our dataset, \dataset, contains \libsAfterRefinement package names which, by construction, only represent libraries, and is meant to evolve.
