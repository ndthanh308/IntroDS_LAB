\section{Future Research Questions}
\label{sec:future_research_question}

This dataset opens avenues for several analyses.
This section draws three research questions that this dataset could be used to address.


\noindent
\textbf{Research Question 1:}
\textit{How does \dataset compare with state-of-the-
art approaches?} With this RQ, \dataset can be compared to existing techniques such as Li et al.~\cite{10.1109/SANER.2016.52} or Ma et al.~\cite{10.1145/2889160.2889178}. Researchers can assess their comprehensiveness and precision.


\noindent
\textbf{Research Question 2:}
\textit{To what extent can \dataset be useful and
effective for static analysis?}
This RQ would evaluate the importance of \dataset. 
Researchers can extract all packages from a dataset of apps and check the number of packages filtered using \dataset.
This quantity can then be compared with the same approach using existing lists or more straightforward approaches, such as only considering the apps' package names to filter libraries.



\noindent
\textbf{Research Question 3:}
\textit{Can \dataset improve the analysis performance
of existing static analysis tools?}
With this RQ, \dataset can be used within existing static analyzers to check whether their performances, in terms of scalability and precision, is improved or not.
