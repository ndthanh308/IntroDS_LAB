	abstract     = {Correlation in the broadest sense is a measure of an association between variables. In correlated data, the change in the magnitude of 1 variable is associated with a change in the magnitude of another variable, either in the same (positive correlation) or in the opposite (negative correlation) direction. Most often, the term correlation is used in the context of a linear relationship between 2 continuous variables and expressed as Pearson product-moment correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient is typically used for jointly normally distributed data (data that follow a bivariate normal distribution). For nonnormally distributed continuous data, for ordinal data, or for data with relevant outliers, a Spearman rank correlation can be used as a measure of a monotonic association. Both correlation coefficients are scaled such that they range from --1 to +1, where 0 indicates that there is no linear or monotonic association, and the relationship gets stronger and ultimately approaches a straight line (Pearson correlation) or a constantly increasing or decreasing curve (Spearman correlation) as the coefficient approaches an absolute value of 1. Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be used to address the statistical significance of the results and to estimate the strength of the relationship in the population from which the data were sampled. The aim of this tutorial is to guide researchers and clinicians in the appropriate use and interpretation of correlation coefficients.}

	abstract     = {Optimizing compilers for object-oriented languages apply static class analysis and other techniques to try to deduce precise information about the possible classes of the receivers of messages; if successful, dynamically-dispatched messages can be replaced with direct procedure calls and potentially further optimized through inline-expansion. By examining the complete inheritance graph of a program, which we call class hierarchy analysis, the compiler can improve the quality of static class information and thereby improve run-time performance. In this paper we present class hierarchy analysis and describe techniques for implementing this analysis effectively in both statically- and dynamically-typed languages and also in the presence of multi-methods. We also discuss how class hierarchy analysis can be supported in an interactive programming environment and, to some extent, in the presence of separate compilation. Finally, we assess the bottom-line performance improvement due to class hierarchy analysis alone and in combination with two other ``competing'' optimizations, profile-guided receiver class prediction and method specialization.}

To this end, code obfuscation is widely utilized by both legitimate app developers and malware authors, which complicates the representation of source code or machine code in order to hinder the manual investigation and code analysis. Despite many previous studies focusing on the obfuscation techniques, however, our knowledge of how obfuscation is applied by real-world developers is still limited.}

	abstract     = {Closed-source software is a major hurdle for assessing the security of computer systems. In absence of source code, it is particularly difficult to locate vulnerabilities and malicious functionality, as crucial information is removed by the compilation process. Most notably, binary programs usually lack type information, which complicates spotting vulnerabilities such as integer flaws or type confusions dramatically. Moreover, data types are often essential for gaining a deeper understanding of the program logic. In this paper we present TypeMiner, a static method for recovering types in binary programs. We build on the assumption that types leave characteristic traits in compiled code that can be automatically identified using machine learning starting at usage locations determined by an analyst. We evaluate the performance of our method with 14 real world software projects written in C and show that it is able to correctly recover the data types in 76{\%}--93{\%} of the cases.}

	abstract     = {A growing number of Android malware detection systems are based on Machine Learning (ML) methods. However, ML methods are often vulnerable to evasion attacks, in which an adversary manipulates malicious instances so they are classified as benign. Here, we present a novel evaluation scheme for evasion attack generation that exploits the weak spots of known Android malware detection systems. We implement an innovative evasion attack on Drebin [3]. After our novel evasion attack, Drebin's detection rate decreased by 12{\%}. However, when inspecting the functionality and maliciousness of the manipulated instances, the maliciousness rate increased, whereas the functionality rate decreased by 72{\%}. We show that non-functional apps, do not constitute a threat to users and are thus useless from an attacker's point of view. Hence, future evaluations of attacks against Android malware detection systems should also address functionality and maliciousness tests.}

We postulate that this research direction could become the next frontier in Android malware detection, and therefore requires a clear roadmap to ensure that new approaches indeed bring novel contributions. We contribute with a first building block by developing and assessing a baseline pipeline for image-based malware detection with straightforward steps.}

With the growing momentum of Android, a number of research contributions have led to tools for the intra-app analysis of Android apps. Unfortunately, these state-of-the-art approaches, and the associated tools, have long left out the security flaws that arise across the boundaries of single apps, in the interaction between several apps. In this paper, we present a tool called ApkCombiner which aims at reducing an inter-app communication problem to an intra-app inter-component communication problem. In practice, ApkCombiner combines different apps into a single apk on which existing tools can indirectly perform inter-app analysis. We have evaluated ApkCombiner on a dataset of 3,000 real-world Android apps, to demonstrate its capability to support static context-aware inter-app analysis scenarios.}

Among OWASP's top ten mobile risks for 2014, the lack of binary protections makes it easy to reverse, modify, and repackage Android apps. Recently, a number of packing services have been proposed to protect Android apps by hiding the original executable file (i.e., dex file). However, little is known about their effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we perform the first systematic investigation on such services by answering two questions: (1) what are the major techniques used by these services and their effects on apps? (2) can the original dex file in a packed app be recovered? If yes, how? We not only reveal their techniques and evaluate their effects, but also propose and develop a novel system, named DexHunter, to extract dex files protected by these services. It is worth noting that DexHunter supports both the Dalvik virtual machine (DVM) and the new Android Runtime (ART). The experimental results show that DexHunter can extract dex files from packed apps effectively and efficiently.}

Among such techniques, the resource-based repackaging detection approach that compares sets of files included in apks has arguably the best performance [10, 17, 20].

We achieve pre-execution analysis by combining static and dynamic techniques to construct control- and data-flow analyses. These analyses form the interface by which the analyst instruments the code. This interface simplifies the instrumentation task, allowing us to reduce the number of instrumented program locations by a hundred-fold relative to existing instrumentation-based methods of identifying unpacked code. We implement our techniques in SD-Dyninst and apply them to a large corpus of malware, performing analysis tasks such as code coverage tests and call-stack traversals that are greatly simplified by hybrid analysis.}

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, app developers have joined the response effort in various ways by releasing apps that target different user bases (e.g., all citizens or journalists), offer different services (e.g., location tracking or diagnostic-aid), provide generic or specialized information, etc. While many apps have raised some concerns by spreading misinformation or even malware, the literature does not yet provide a clear landscape of the different apps that were developed. In this study, we focus on the Android ecosystem and investigate Covid-related Android apps. In a best-effort scenario, we attempt to systematically identify all relevant apps and study their characteristics with the objective to provide a first taxonomy of Covid-related apps, broadening the relevance beyond the implementation of contact tracing. Overall, our study yields a number of empirical insights that contribute to enlarge the knowledge on Covid-related apps: (1) Developer communities contributed rapidly to the COVID-19, with dedicated apps released as early as January 2020; (2) Covid-related apps deliver digital tools to users (e.g., health diaries), serve to broadcast information to users (e.g., spread statistics), and collect data from users (e.g., for tracing); (3) Covid-related apps are less complex than standard apps; (4) they generally do not seem to leak sensitive data; (5) in the majority of cases, Covid-related apps are released by entities with past experience on the market, mostly official government entities or public health organizations.}

People have been using the traditional security programs of pattern matching technique such as anti-virus and anti-spyware to protect their computer from malicious code. These security programs, however, cannot completely scan malicious behaviors attacking through the unknown vulnerability and are hard to protect from the attacks using self-modifying code which changes its own codes during runtime. To prevent these security risks, we develop the dynamic binary analyzer that can find these unknown vulnerabilities and self-modifying code. We adopt taint analysis to find vulnerabilities that transpire during runtime. Also using taint analysis let us check what effects have been occurred to programs by the input data and how they do spread widely to across the resources in an operating system. Adopting the dynamic analysis that drives and analyzes the system only in virtual machine circumstance through the emulator can make us detect the falsification of program code in program operational process. So we describe the framework of our analyzer and then explain the execution process and output of each process by using three test case demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce several test cases of the security vulnerability for the demonstration and explain the results of proposed analyzer on test cases. The dynamic binary analyzer for scanning vulnerabilities with taint analysis (1) can find out existed security vulnerabilities in binary file, (2) can monitor all the actions of the binary file that affects operating system and (3) can be an expandable tool through the additional security element and policy.}

This process is a necessary step to be able to develop effective detection techniques for malicious code. In addition, it is an important prerequisite for the development of removal tools that can thoroughly delete malware from an infected machine. Traditionally, malware analysis has been a manual process that is tedious and time-intensive. Unfortunately, the number of samples that need to be analyzed by security vendors on a daily basis is constantly increasing. This clearly reveals the need for tools that automate and simplify parts of the analysis process. In this paper, we present TTAnalyze, a tool for dynamically analyzing the behavior of Windows executables. To this end, the binary is run in an emulated operating system environment and its (security-relevant) actions are monitored. In particular, we record the Windows native system calls and Windows API functions that the program invokes. One important feature of our system is that it does not modify the program that it executes (e.g., through API call hooking or breakpoints), making it more difficult to detect by malicious code. Also, our tool runs binaries in an unmodified Windows environment, which leads to excellent emulation accuracy. These factors make TTAnalyze an ideal tool for quickly understanding the behavior of an unknown malware.}

Many of the malicious samples are variations of previously encountered malware, created by their authors to evade pattern-based detection. Dealing with these large amounts of data requires robust, automatic detection approaches. This paper studies malware classification based on call graph clustering. By representing malware samples as call graphs, it is possible to abstract certain variations away, enabling the detection of structural similarities between samples. The ability to cluster similar samples together will make more generic detection techniques possible, thereby targeting the commonalities of the samples within a cluster. To compare call graphs mutually, we compute pairwise graph similarity scores via graph matchings which approximately minimize the graph edit distance. Next, to facilitate the discovery of similar malware samples, we employ several clustering algorithms, including k-medoids and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Clustering experiments are conducted on a collection of real malware samples, and the results are evaluated against manual classifications provided by human malware analysts. Experiments show that it is indeed possible to accurately detect malware families via call graph clustering. We anticipate that in the future, call graphs can be used to analyse the emergence of new malware families, and ultimately to automate implementation of generic detection schemes.}

The effectiveness of current tools relies on the app model as well as the malware detection algorithm which analyzes the app model. If the model and/or the algorithm is inadequate, then sophisticated attacks that are triggered by specific sequences of events will not be detected.This paper presents a static analysis framework called Dexteroid, which uses reverse-engineered life cycle models to accurately capture the behaviors of Android components. Dexteroid systematically derives event sequences from the models, and uses them to detect attacks launched by specific ordering of events. A prototype implementation of Dexteroid detects two types of attacks: (1) leakage of private information, and (2) sending SMS to premium-rate numbers. A series of experiments are conducted on 1526 Google Play apps, 1259 Genome Malware apps, and a suite of benchmark apps called DroidBench and the results are compared with a state-of-the-art static analysis tool called FlowDroid. The evaluation results show that the proposed framework is effective and efficient in terms of precision, recall, and execution time.},

	abstract     = {According to the Symantec and F-Secure threat reports, mobile malware development in 2013 and 2014 has continued to focus almost exclusively (~99\%) on the Android platform. Malware writers are applying stealthy mutations (obfuscations) to create malware variants, thwarting detection by signature-based detectors. In addition, the plethora of more sophisticated detectors making use of static analysis techniques to detect such variants operate only at the bytecode level, meaning that malware embedded in native code goes undetected. A recent study shows that 86\% of the most popular Android applications contain native code, making native code malware a plausible threat vector. This paper proposes DroidNative, an Android malware detector that uses specific control flow patterns to reduce the effect of obfuscations and provides automation. As far as we know, DroidNative is the first system that builds cross-platform (x86 and ARM) semantic-based signatures at the Android native code level, allowing the system to detect malware embedded in either bytecode or native code. When tested with a dataset of 5490 samples, DroidNative achieves a detection rate (DR) of 93.57\% and a false positive rate of 2.7\%. When tested with traditional malware variants, it achieves a DR of 99.48\%, compared to the DRs of academic and commercial tools that range from 8.33\% to 93.22\%.}

	abstract     = {Context Static analysis exploits techniques that parse program source code or bytecode, often traversing program paths to check some program properties. Static analysis approaches have been proposed for different tasks, including for assessing the security of Android apps, detecting app clones, automating test cases generation, or for uncovering non-functional issues related to performance or energy. The literature thus has proposed a large body of works, each of which attempts to tackle one or more of the several challenges that program analyzers face when dealing with Android apps. Objective We aim to provide a clear view of the state-of-the-art works that statically analyze Android apps, from which we highlight the trends of static analysis approaches, pinpoint where the focus has been put, and enumerate the key aspects where future researches are still needed. Method We have performed a systematic literature review (SLR) which involves studying 124 research papers published in software engineering, programming languages and security venues in the last 5 years (January 2011–December 2015). This review is performed mainly in five dimensions: problems targeted by the approach, fundamental techniques used by authors, static analysis sensitivities considered, android characteristics taken into account and the scale of evaluation performed. Results Our in-depth examination has led to several key findings: 1) Static analysis is largely performed to uncover security and privacy issues; 2) The Soot framework and the Jimple intermediate representation are the most adopted basic support tool and format, respectively; 3) Taint analysis remains the most applied technique in research approaches; 4) Most approaches support several analysis sensitivities, but very few approaches consider path-sensitivity; 5) There is no single work that has been proposed to tackle all challenges of static analysis that are related to Android programming; and 6) Only a small portion of state-of-the-art works have made their artifacts publicly available. Conclusion The research community is still facing a number of challenges for building approaches that are aware altogether of implicit-Flows, dynamic code loading features, reflective calls, native code and multi-threading, in order to implement sound and highly precise static analyzers.}

Most of these tools simply scramble the names of the identifiers stored in a bytecode by substituting the identifiers with meaningless names. However, the scrambling technique cannot deter a determined cracker very long. We propose several advanced obfuscation techniques that make Java bytecode impossible to recompile or make the decompiled program difficult to understand and to recompile. The crux of our approach is to over use an identifier. That is, an identifier can denote several entities, such as types, fields, and methods, simultaneously. An additional benefit is that the size of the bytecode is reduced because fewer and shorter identifier names are used. Furthermore, we also propose several techniques to intentionally introduce syntactic and semantic errors into the decompiled program while preserving the original behaviors of the bytecode. Thus, the decompiled program would have to be debugged manually. Although our basic approach is to scramble the identifiers in Java bytecode, the scrambled bytecode produced with our techniques is much harder to crack than that produced with other identifier scrambling techniques. Furthermore, the run-time efficiency of the obfuscated bytecode is also improved because the size of the bytecode becomes smaller after obfuscation.}

	abstract     = {Implicit or indirect control flow is a transfer of control between procedures using some mechanism other than an explicit procedure call. Implicit control flow is a staple design pattern that adds flexibility to system design. However, it is challenging for a static analysis to compute or verify properties about a system that uses implicit control flow.This paper presents static analyses for two types of implicit control flow that frequently appear in Android apps: Java reflection and Android intents. Our analyses help to resolve where control flows and what data is passed. This information improves the precision of downstream analyses, which no longer need to make conservative assumptions about implicit control flow.We have implemented our techniques for Java. We enhanced an existing security analysis with a more precise treatment of reflection and intents. In a case study involving ten real-world Android apps that use both intents and reflection, the precision of the security analysis was increased on average by two orders of magnitude. The precision of two other downstream analyses was also improved.},

	abstract     = {In the past, researchers have developed a number of popular taint-analysis approaches, particularly in the context of Android applications. Numerous studies have shown that automated code analyses are adopted by developers only if they yield a good "signal to noise ratio", i.e., high precision. Many previous studies have reported analysis precision quantitatively, but this gives little insight into what can and should be done to increase precision further.To guide future research on increasing precision, we present a comprehensive study that evaluates static Android taint-analysis results on a qualitative level. To unravel the exact nature of taint flows, we have designed COVA, an analysis tool to compute partial path constraints that inform about the circumstances under which taint flows may actually occur in practice.We have conducted a qualitative study on the taint flows reported by FlowDroid in 1,022 real-world Android applications. Our results reveal several key findings: Many taint flows occur only under specific conditions, e.g., environment settings, user interaction, I/O. Taint analyses should consider the application context to discern such situations. COVA shows that few taint flows are guarded by multiple different kinds of conditions simultaneously, so tools that seek to confirm true positives dynamically can concentrate on one kind at a time, e.g., only simulating user interactions. Lastly, many false positives arise due to a too liberal source/sink configuration. Taint analyses must be more carefully configured, and their configuration could benefit from better tool assistance.},

The type inferred for any variable represents a set of locations and includes a type which in turn represents a set of locations possibly pointed to by the variable. The type inferred for a function variable represents a set of functions It may point to and includes a type signature for these functions The results are equivalent to those of a flow-insensitive alias analysis (and control flow analysis) that assumes alias relations are reflexive and transitive.This work makes three contributions. The first is a type system for describing a universally valid storage shape graph for a program in linear space. The second is a constraint system which often leads to better results than the "obvious" constraint system for the given type system The third is an almost linear time algorithm for points-to analysis by solving a constraint system.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been explosive growth in smartphone sales, which is accompanied with the availability of a huge number of smartphone applications (or simply apps). End users or consumers are attracted by the many interesting features offered by these devices and the associated apps. The developers of these apps are also benefited by the prospect of financial compensation, either by selling their apps directly or by embedding one of the many ad libraries available on smartphone platforms. In this paper, we focus on potential privacy and security risks posed by these embedded or in-app advertisement libraries (henceforth "ad libraries," for brevity). To this end, we study the popular Android platform and collect 100,000 apps from the official Android Market in March-May, 2011. Among these apps, we identify 100 representative in-app ad libraries (embedded in 52.1\% of them) and further develop a system called AdRisk to systematically identify potential risks. In particular, we first decouple the embedded ad libraries from host apps and then apply our system to statically examine the ad libraries, ranging from whether they will upload privacy-sensitive information to remote (ad) servers or whether they will download untrusted code from remote servers. Our results show that most existing ad libraries collect private information: some of them may be used for legitimate targeting purposes (i.e., the user's location) while others are hard to justify by invasively collecting the information such as the user's call logs, phone number, browser bookmarks, or even the list of installed apps on the phone. Moreover, additional ones go a step further by making use of an unsafe mechanism to directly fetch and run code from the Internet, which immediately leads to serious security risks. Our investigation indicates the symbiotic relationship between embedded ad libraries and host apps is one main reason behind these exposed risks. These results clearly show the need for better regulating the way ad libraries are integrated in Android apps.},

abstract = {We present LibRadar, a tool that is able to detect third-party libraries used in an Android app accurately and instantly. As third-party libraries are widely used in Android apps, program analysis on Android apps typically needs to detect or remove third-party libraries first in order to function correctly or provide accurate results. However, most previous studies employ a whitelist of package names of known libraries, which is incomplete and unable to deal with obfuscation. In contrast, LibRadar detects libraries based on stable API features that are obfuscation resilient in most cases. After analyzing one million free Android apps from Google Play, we have identified possible libraries and collected their unique features. Based on these features, LibRadar can detect third-party libraries in a given Android app within seconds, as it only requires simple static analysis and fast comparison. LibRadar is available for public use at http://radar.pkuos.org. The demo video is available at: https://youtu.be/GoMYjYxsZnI},

abstract = {Third-party libraries on Android have been shown to be security and privacy hazards by adding security vulnerabilities to their host apps or by misusing inherited access rights. Correctly attributing improper app behavior either to app or library developer code or isolating library code from their host apps would be highly desirable to mitigate these problems, but is impeded by the absence of a third-party library detection that is effective and reliable in spite of obfuscated code. This paper proposes a library detection technique that is resilient against common code obfuscations and that is capable of pinpointing the exact library version used in apps. Libraries are detected with profiles from a comprehensive library database that we generated from the original library SDKs. We apply our technique to the top apps on Google Play and their complete histories to conduct a longitudinal study of library usage and evolution in apps. Our results particularly show that app developers only slowly adapt new library versions, exposing their end-users to large windows of vulnerability. For instance, we discovered that two long-known security vulnerabilities in popular libs are still present in the current top apps. Moreover, we find that misuse of cryptographic APIs in advertising libs, which increases the host apps' attack surface, affects 296 top apps with a cumulative install base of 3.7bn devices according to Play. To the best of our knowledge, our work is first to quantify the security impact of third-party libs on the Android ecosystem.},

abstract = {Besides traditional problems such as potential bugs, (smartphone) application clones on Android markets bring new threats. That is, attackers clone the code from legitimate Android applications, assemble it with malicious code or advertisements, and publish these ``purpose-added" app clones on the same or other markets for benefits. Three inherent and unique characteristics make app clones difficult to detect by existing techniques: a billion opcode problem caused by cross-market publishing, gap between code clones and app clones, and prevalent Type 2 and Type 3 clones. Existing techniques achieve either accuracy or scalability, but not both. To achieve both goals, we use a geometry characteristic, called centroid, of dependency graphs to measure the similarity between methods (code fragments) in two apps. Then we synthesize the method-level similarities and draw a Y/N conclusion on app (core functionality) cloning. The observed ``centroid effect" and the inherent ``monotonicity" property enable our approach to achieve both high accuracy and scalability. We implemented the app clone detection system and evaluated it on five whole Android markets (including 150,145 apps, 203 million methods and 26 billion opcodes). It takes less than one hour to perform cross-market app clone detection on the five markets after generating centroids only once.},

	abstract     = {Application repackaging is a severe threat to Android users and the market. Not only does it infringe on intellectual property, but it is also one of the most common ways of propagating mobile malware. Existing countermeasures mostly detect repackaging based on app similarity measurement, which tends to be imprecise when obfuscations are applied to repackaged apps. Moreover, they rely on a central party, typically the hosting app store, to perform the detection, but many app stores fail to commit proper effort to piracy detection. We consider building the application repackaging detection capability into apps, such that user devices are made use to detect repackaging in a decentralized fashion. <italic>The main challenge is how to protect the detection code from being manipulated by attacks</italic>. We propose a creative use of <italic>logic bombs</italic>, which are otherwise regularly used in malware. The <italic>trigger conditions</italic> of bombs are constructed to exploit the differences between the attacker and users, such that a bomb that lies dormant on the attacker side will be activated on the user side. The detection code, which is part of the bomb <italic>payload</italic>, is executed only if the bomb is activated. We introduce <italic>cryptographically obfuscated logic bomb</italic> to enhance the bomb: (1) the detection code is <italic>woven</italic> into the neighboring original app code, (2) the mixed code gets encrypted using a key, and (3) the key is deleted from the app and can only be derived when the bomb is activated. Thus, attacks that try to modify or delete the detection code will corrupt the app itself, and searching the key in the application will be in vain. Moreover, we propose a <italic>bomb spraying</italic> technique that allows many bombs to be injected into an app, multiplying the needed adversary effort for bypassing the detection. In addition to repackaging detection, we present application tampering detection to fight attacks that insert malicious code into repackaged apps. We have implemented a prototype, named <sc>BombDroid</sc>, that builds repackaging and tampering detection into apps through bytecode instrumentation. The evaluation and the security analysis show that the technique is effective, efficient, and resilient to various bomb analysis techniques including fuzzing, symbolic execution, multi-path exploration, and program slicing. Ethical issues due to the use of logic bombs are also discussed.},

	abstract     = {Most existing mobile malware detection methods (e.g., Kirin and DroidMat) are designed based on the resources required by malwares (e.g., permissions, application programming interface (API) calls, and system calls). These methods capture the interactions between mobile apps and Android system, but ignore the communications among components within or cross application boundaries. As a consequence, the majority of the existing methods are less effective in identifying many typical malwares, which require a few or no suspicious resources, but leverage on inter-component communication (ICC) mechanism when launching stealthy attacks. To address this challenge, we propose a new malware detection method, named ICCDetector. ICCDetector outputs a detection model after training with a set of benign apps and a set of malwares, and employs the trained model for malware detection. The performance of ICCDetector is evaluated with 5264 malwares, and 12026 benign apps. Compared with our benchmark, which is a permission-based method proposed by Peng et al. in 2012 with an accuracy up to 88.2\%, ICCDetector achieves an accuracy of 97.4\%, roughly 10\% higher than the benchmark, with a lower false positive rate of 0.67\%, which is only about a half of the benchmark. After manually analyzing false positives, we discover 43 new malwares from the benign data set, and reduce the number of false positives to seven. More importantly, ICCDetector discovers 1708 more advanced malwares than the benchmark, while it misses 220 obvious malwares, which can be easily detected by the benchmark. For the detected malwares, ICCDetector further classifies them into five newly defined malware categories, which help understand the relationship between malicious behaviors and ICC characteristics. We also provide a systemic analysis of ICC patterns of benign apps and malwares.},

Although recent research has produced approaches and tools to identify piggybacked apps, the literature lacks a comprehensive investigation into such phenomenon. We fill this gap by: 1) systematically building a large set of piggybacked and benign apps pairs, which we release to the community; 2) empirically studying the characteristics of malicious piggybacked apps in comparison with their benign counterparts; and 3) providing insights on piggybacking processes. Among several findings providing insights analysis techniques should build upon to improve the overall detection and classification accuracy of piggybacked apps, we show that piggybacking operations not only concern app code, but also extensively manipulates app resource files, largely contradicting common beliefs. We also find that piggybacking is done with little sophistication, in many cases automatically, and often via library code.},

It is desirable to have an alternative way of auditing AMTs. In our previous paper, we use malware samples from android malware collection Genome to summarize a malware meta-model for modularizing the common attack behaviors and evasion techniques in reusable features. We then combine different features with an evolutionary algorithm, in which way we evolve malware for variants. Previous results have shown that the existing AMTs only exhibit detection rate of 20\%–30\% for 10 000 evolved malware variants. In this paper, based on the modularized attack features, we apply the dynamic code generation and loading techniques to produce malware, so that we can audit the AMTs at runtime. We implement our approach, named Mystique-S, as a service-oriented malware generation system. Mystique-S automatically selects attack features under various user scenarios and delivers the corresponding malicious payloads at runtime. Relying on dynamic code binding (via service) and loading (via reflection) techniques, Mystique-S enables dynamic execution of payloads on user devices at runtime. Experimental results on real-world devices show that existing AMTs are incapable of detecting most of our generated malware. Last, we propose the enhancements for existing AMTs.},

The goal of our system is to prevent foreign function calls from introducing type and memory safety violations into an otherwise safe language. Our system targets OCaml's FFI to C, which is relatively lightweight and illustrates some interesting challenges in multi-lingual type inference. The type language in our system embeds OCaml types in C types and vice-versa, which allows us to track type information accurately even through the foreign language, where the original types are lost. Our system uses representational types that can model multiple OCaml types, because C programs can observe that many OCaml types have the same physical representation. Furthermore, because C has a low-level view of OCaml data, our inference system includes a dataflow analysis to track memory offsets and tag information. Finally, our type system includes garbage collection information to ensure that pointers from the FFI to the OCaml heap are tracked properly. We have implemented our inference system and applied it to a small set of benchmarks. Our results show that programmers do misuse these interfaces, and our implementation has found several bugs and questionable coding practices in our benchmarks.},

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

How can it get hold of classes that the program loads from remote locations or even generates on the fly? And if the analysis transforms classes, how can these classes be re-inserted into a program that uses custom class loaders?In this paper, we present TamiFlex, a tool chain that offers a partial but often effective solution to these problems. With TamiFlex, programmers can use existing static-analysis tools to produce results that are sound at least with respect to a set of recorded program runs. TamiFlex inserts runtime checks into the program that warn the user in case the program executes reflective calls that the analysis did not take into account. TamiFlex further allows programmers to re-insert offline-transformed classes into a program.We evaluate TamiFlex in two scenarios: benchmarking with the DaCapo benchmark suite and analysing large-scale interactive applications. For the latter, TamiFlex significantly improves code coverage of the static analyses, while for the former our approach even appears complete: the inserted runtime checks issue no warning. Hence, for the first time, TamiFlex enables sound static whole-program analyses on DaCapo. During this process, TamiFlex usually incurs less than 10% runtime overhead.},

In addition to an open API, the Android operating system also provides a rich inter-application message passing system. This encourages inter-application collaboration and reduces developer burden by facilitating component reuse. Unfortunately, message passing is also an application attack surface. The content of messages can be sniffed, modified, stolen, or replaced, which can compromise user privacy. Also, a malicious application can inject forged or otherwise malicious messages, which can lead to breaches of user data and violate application security policies.We examine Android application interaction and identify security risks in application components. We provide a tool, ComDroid, that detects application communication vulnerabilities. ComDroid can be used by developers to analyze their own applications before release, by application reviewers to analyze applications in the Android Market, and by end users. We analyzed 20 applications with the help of ComDroid and found 34 exploitable vulnerabilities; 12 of the 20 applications have at least one vulnerability.},

The detector is embedded in a overall framework for collection of traces from an unlimited number of real users based on crowdsourcing. Our framework has been demonstrated by analyzing the data collected in the central server using two types of data sets: those from artificial malware created for test purposes, and those from real malware found in the wild. The method is shown to be an effective means of isolating the malware and alerting the users of a downloaded malware. This shows the potential for avoiding the spreading of a detected malware to a larger community.},

We retrofit the Android operating system to implement these two controls for use with unmodified applications. A key challenge of imposing shadowing and exfiltration blocking on existing applications is that these controls could cause side effects that interfere with user-desired functionality. To measure the impact of side effects, we develop an automated testing methodology that records screenshots of application executions both with and without privacy controls, then automatically highlights the visual differences between the different executions. We evaluate our privacy controls on 50 applications from the Android Market, selected from those that were both popular and permission-hungry. We find that our privacy controls can successfully reduce the effective permissions of the application without causing side effects for 66% of the tested applications. The remaining 34% of applications implemented user-desired functionality that required violating the privacy requirements our controls were designed to enforce; there was an unavoidable choice between privacy and user-desired functionality.},

While WALA's implementation is geared much towards memory efficiency, ours is currently geared more towards extensibility and ease of use and we focus on efficiency as a secondary goal.We further discuss possible extensions to our IFDS/IDE implementation that may be useful to support a wider range of analyses.},

We systematically identified 1,238 such malicious applications, grouped them into 134 families, and manually analyzed one application from 105 distinct families. During our manual analysis, we identified malicious payloads the applications execute, conditions guarding execution of the payloads, hiding techniques applications employ to evade detection by the user, and other implementation-level properties relevant for automated malware detection. As most applications in our dataset contain multiple payloads, each triggered via its own complex activation logic, we also contribute a graph-based representation showing activation paths for all application payloads in form of a control- and data-flow graph. Furthermore, we discuss the capabilities of existing malware detection tools, put them in context of the properties observed in the analyzed malware, and identify gaps and future research directions. We believe that our detailed analysis of the recent, evasive malware will be of interest to researchers and practitioners and will help further improve malware detection tools.},

	abstract     = {Smartphone sales have recently experienced explosive growth. Their popularity also encourages malware authors to penetrate various mobile marketplaces with malicious applications (or apps). These malicious apps hide in the sheer number of other normal apps, which makes their detection challenging. Existing mobile anti-virus software are inadequate in their reactive nature by relying on known malware samples for signature extraction. In this paper, we propose a proactive scheme to spot zero-day Android malware. Without relying on malware samples and their signatures, our scheme is motivated to assess potential security risks posed by these untrusted apps. Specifically, we have developed an automated system called RiskRanker to scalably analyze whether a particular app exhibits dangerous behavior (e.g., launching a root exploit or sending background SMS messages). The output is then used to produce a prioritized list of reduced apps that merit further investigation. When applied to examine 118,318 total apps collected from various Android markets over September and October 2011, our system takes less than four days to process all of them and effectively reports 3281 risky apps. Among these reported apps, we successfully uncovered 718 malware samples (in 29 families) and 322 of them are zero-day (in 11 families). These results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of RiskRanker to police Android markets of all stripes.},

In this paper we focus on the challenging task of triggering a certain behavior through automated UI interactions. In particular, we propose a hybrid static and dynamic analysis method to reveal UI-based trigger conditions in Android applications. Our method first uses static analysis to extract expected activity switch paths by analyzing both Activity and Function Call Graphs, and then uses dynamic analysis to traverse each UI elements and explore the UI interaction paths towards the sensitive APIs. We implement a prototype system SmartDroid and show that it can automatically and efficiently detect the UI-based trigger conditions required to expose the sensitive behavior of several Android malwares, which otherwise cannot be detected with existing techniques such as TaintDroid.},

	abstract     = {Modern smartphone operating systems (OSs) have been developed with a greater emphasis on security and protecting privacy. One of the mechanisms these systems use to protect users is a permission system, which requires developers to declare what sensitive resources their applications will use, has users agree with this request when they install the application and constrains the application to the requested resources during runtime. As these permission systems become more common, questions have risen about their design and implementation. In this paper, we perform an analysis of the permission system of the Android smartphone OS in an attempt to begin answering some of these questions. Because the documentation of Android's permission system is incomplete and because we wanted to be able to analyze several versions of Android, we developed PScout, a tool that extracts the permission specification from the Android OS source code using static analysis. PScout overcomes several challenges, such as scalability due to Android's 3.4 million line code base, accounting for permission enforcement across processes due to Android's use of IPC, and abstracting Android's diverse permission checking mechanisms into a single primitive for analysis.We use PScout to analyze 4 versions of Android spanning version 2.2 up to the recently released Android 4.0. Our main findings are that while Android has over 75 permissions, there is little redundancy in the permission specification. However, if applications could be constrained to only use documented APIs, then about 22\% of the non-system permissions are actually unnecessary. Finally, we find that a trade-off exists between enabling least-privilege security with fine-grained permissions and maintaining stability of the permission specification as the Android OS evolves.},

However, app repackaging, among many other threats, brings tremendous risk to the ecosystem, including app developers, app market operators, and end users. To mitigate such threat, we propose and develop a watermarking mechanism for Android apps. First, towards automatic watermark embedding and extraction, we introduce the novel concept of manifest app, which is a companion of a target Android app under protection. We then design and develop a tool named AppInk, which takes the source code of an app as input to automatically generate a new app with a transparently-embedded watermark and the associated manifest app. The manifest app can be later used to reliably recognize embedded watermark with zero user intervention. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AppInk in preventing app repackaging, we analyze its robustness in defending against distortive, subtractive, and additive attacks, and then evaluate its resistance against two open source repackaging tools. Our results show that AppInk is easy to use, effective in defending against current known repackaging threats on Android platform, and introduces small performance overhead.},

Our detection heuristics span three different categories based on (i) static properties, (ii) dynamic sensor information, and (iii) VM-related intricacies of the Android Emulator. To assess the effectiveness of our techniques, we incorporated them in real malware samples and submitted them to publicly available Android dynamic analysis systems, with alarming results. We found all tools and services to be vulnerable to most of our evasion techniques. Even trivial techniques, such as checking the value of the IMEI, are enough to evade some of the existing dynamic analysis frameworks.

We further define the happens-before relation for Android applications, and develop a dynamic race detection technique based on this relation. Our relation generalizes the so far independently studied happens-before relations for multi-threaded programs and single-threaded event-driven programs. Additionally, our race detection technique uses a model of the Android runtime environment to reduce false positives.We have implemented a tool called DroidRacer. It generates execution traces by systematically testing Android applications and detects data races by computing the happens-before relation on the traces. We analyzed 15 Android applications including popular applications such as Facebook, Twitter and K-9 Mail. Our results indicate that data races are prevalent in Android applications, and that DroidRacer is an effective tool to identify data races.},

Several such empirical studies used Android applications (paid, free, and open source) to analyze factors such as size, quality, dependencies, reuse, and cloning. Most of the studies use executable files of the apps (APK files), instead of source code because of availability issues (most of free apps available at the Android official market are not open-source, but still can be downloaded and analyzed in APK format). However, using only APK files in empirical studies comes with some threats to the validity of the results. In this paper, we analyze some of these pertinent threats. In particular, we analyzed the impact of third-party libraries and code obfuscation practices on estimating the amount of reuse by class cloning in Android apps. When including and excluding third-party libraries from the analysis, we found statistically significant differences in the amount of class cloning 24,379 free Android apps. Also, we found some evidence that obfuscation is responsible for increasing a number of false positives when detecting class clones. Finally, based on our findings, we provide a list of actionable guidelines for mining and analyzing large repositories of Android applications and minimizing these threats to validity},

Since Amandroid's analysis directly handles inter-component control and data flows, it can be used to address security problems that result from interactions among multiple components from either the same or different apps. Amandroid's analysis is sound in that it can provide assurance of the absence of the specified security problems in an app with well-specified and reasonable assumptions on Android runtime system and its library.},

	abstract     = {To build effective malware analysis techniques and to evaluate new detection tools, up-to-date datasets reflecting the current Android malware landscape are essential. For such datasets to be maximally useful, they need to contain reliable and complete information on malware's behaviors and techniques used in the malicious activities. Such a dataset shall also provide a comprehensive coverage of a large number of types of malware. The Android Malware Genome created circa 2011 has been the only well-labeled and widely studied dataset the research community had easy access to (As of 12/21/2015 the Genome authors have stopped supporting the dataset sharing due to resource limitation). But not only is it outdated and no longer represents the current Android malware landscape, it also does not provide as detailed information on malware's behaviors as needed for research. Thus it is urgent to create a high-quality dataset for Android malware. While existing information sources such as VirusTotal are useful, to obtain the accurate and detailed information for malware behaviors, deep manual analysis is indispensable. In this work we present our approach to preparing a large Android malware dataset for the research community. We leverage existing anti-virus scan results and automation techniques in categorizing our large dataset (containing 24,650 malware app samples) into 135 varieties (based on malware behavioral semantics) which belong to 71 malware families. For each variety, we select three samples as representatives, for a total of 405 malware samples, to conduct in-depth manual analysis. Based on the manual analysis result we generate detailed descriptions of each malware variety's behaviors and include them in our dataset. We also report our observations on the current landscape of Android malware as depicted in the dataset. Furthermore, we present detailed documentation of the process used in creating the dataset, including the guidelines for the manual analysis. We make our Android malware dataset available to the research community.}

By applying control-transfer-oriented semantic analysis of the bytecode language, we identify five IIF forms, some of which are not studied by existing IIF literature. We develop proof-of-concepts (PoCs) for each IIF form to demonstrate their exploitability. The experimental results show that all these PoCs can effectively and efficiently transmit sensitive data, as well as successfully evade the detection of a state-of-the-art privacy monitor TaintDroid. To mitigate the threat of IIF, we propose a solution to defending against IIF leveraging a special control dependence tracking technique and implement a prototype system. The evaluation shows that the prototype can effectively detect information leak by all the identified IIF forms and also real-world malware with an acceptable overhead. In summary, our study gives in-depth insight into Android IIF from both offensive and defensive perspectives, and provides a foundation for further research on Android IIF.},

	abstract     = {Facing the limited resource of smartphones, asynchronous programming significantly improves the performance of Android applications. Android provides several packaged components to ease the development of asynchronous programming. Among them, the AsyncTask component is widely used by developers since it is easy to implement. However, the abuse of AsyncTask component can decrease responsiveness and even lead to crashes. By investigating the Android Developer Documentation and technical forums, we summarize five misuse patterns about AsyncTask. To detect them, we propose a flow, context, object and field-sensitive inter-procedural static analysis approach. Specifically, the static analysis includes typestate analysis, reference analysis and loop analysis. Based on the AsyncTask-related information obtained during static analysis, we check the misuse according to predefined detection rules. The proposed approach is implemented into a tool called AsyncChecker. We evaluate AsyncChecker on a self-designed benchmark suite called AsyncBench and 1,759 real-world apps. AsyncChecker finds 17,946 misused AsyncTask instances in 1,417 real-world apps (80.6\%). The precision, recall and F-measure of AsyncChecker on real-world applications are 97.2\%, 89.8\% and 0.93, respectively. Compared with existing tools, AsyncChecker can detect more asynchronous problems. We report the misuse problems to developers via GitHub. Several developers have confirmed and fixed the problems found by AsyncChecker. The result implies that our approach is effective and developers do take the misuse of AsyncTask as a serious problem.},

While this enables the development of efficient and feature-rich applications, unforeseen thread interleavings coupled with non-deterministic reorderings of asynchronous tasks can lead to subtle concurrency errors in the applications.In this paper, we formalize the concurrency semantics of the Android programming model. We further define the happens-before relation for Android applications, and develop a dynamic race detection technique based on this relation. Our relation generalizes the so far independently studied happens-before relations for multi-threaded programs and single-threaded event-driven programs. Additionally, our race detection technique uses a model of the Android runtime environment to reduce false positives.We have implemented a tool called DroidRacer. It generates execution traces by systematically testing Android applications and detects data races by computing the happens-before relation on the traces. We analyzed 15 Android applications including popular applications such as Facebook, Twitter and K-9 Mail. Our results indicate that data races are prevalent in Android applications, and that DroidRacer is an effective tool to identify data races.},

	abstract     = {Informally, a call graph represents calls between entities in a given program. The call graphs that compilers compute to determine the applicability of an optimization must typically be conservative: a call may be omitted only if it can never occur in any execution of the program. Numerous software engineering tools also extract call graphs with the expectation that they will help software engineers increase their understanding of a program. The requirements placed on software engineering tools that compute call graphs are typically more relaxed than for compilers. For example, some false negatives—calls that can in fact take place in some execution of the program, but which are omitted from the call graph—may be acceptable, depending on the understanding task at hand. In  this article, we empirically show a consequence of this spectrum of requirements by comparing the C call graphs extracted from three software systems (mapmaker, mosaic, and gcc) by nine tools (cflow, cawk, CIA, Field, GCT, Imagix, LSME, Mawk, and Rigiparse). A quantitative analysis of the call graphs extracted for each system shows considerable variation, a result that is counterintuitive to many experienced software engineers. A qualitative analysis of these results reveals a number of reasons for  this variation: differing treatments of macros, function pointers, input formats, etc. The fundamental problem is not that variances among the graphs extracted by different tools exist, but that software engineers have little sense of the dimensions of approximation in any particular call  graph. In this article, we describe and discuss the study, sketch a design space for static call graph extractors, and discuss the impact of our study on practitioners, tool developers, and researchers. Although this article considers only one kind of information, call graphs, many of the observations also apply to static extractors of other kinds of information, such as inheritance structures, file dependences, and references to global variables.},

The target of our work is static detection of energy-drain defects in Android applications. The management of energy-intensive resources (e.g., GPS) creates various opportunities for software defects. Our goal is to detect statically “missing deactivation” energy-drain defects in the user interface of the application. First, we define precisely two patterns of run-time energy-drain behaviors, based on modeling of Android GUI control-flow paths and energy-related listener leaks along such paths. Next, we define a static detection algorithm targeting these patterns. The analysis considers valid interprocedural control-flow paths in a callback method and its transitive callees, in order to detect operations that add or remove listeners. Sequences of callbacks are then analyzed for possible listener leaks. Our evaluation considers the detection of GUI-related energy-drain defects reported in prior work, as well as new defects not discovered by prior approaches. In summary, the detection is very effective and precise, suggesting that the proposed analysis is suitable for practical use in static checking tools for Android.},

Excessive consumption of such resources may lead to crashes, poor responsiveness, battery drain, and negative user experience. We propose an approach for systematic automated test generation to expose resource leak defects in Android applications. We first define the notion of a neutral sequence of GUI events. Intuitively, such a sequence can be expected to have "neutral" effects on resource consumption, and repeated executions of this sequence should not exhibit resource growth. Using a state-of-the-art static control-flow model of an Android application, we demonstrate how to achieve automated generation of such sequences. We then define test generation algorithms for two important categories of neutral sequences, based on common leak patterns specific to Android. Our experimental evaluation compares this approach with a non-automated approach from prior work. The results from this evaluation strongly indicate that it is possible to achieve effective, general, and automated test generation for resource leaks in Android applications using the proposed techniques.},

Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art static analysis tools for Android are challenged by the presence of reflective calls which they usually ignore. Thus, the results of their security analysis, e.g., for private data leaks, are inconsistent given the measures taken by malware writers to elude static detection. We propose the DroidRA instrumentation-based approach to address this issue in a non-invasive way. With DroidRA, we reduce the resolution of reflective calls to a composite constant propagation problem. We leverage the COAL solver to infer the values of reflection targets and app, and we eventually instrument this app to include the corresponding traditional Java call for each reflective call. Our approach allows to boost an app so that it can be immediately analyzable, including by such static analyzers that were not reflection-aware. We evaluate DroidRA on benchmark apps as well as on real-world apps, and demonstrate that it can allow state-of-the-art tools to provide more sound and complete analysis results.},

	abstract     = {Current app stores distribute some malware to unsuspecting users, even though the app approval process may be costly and time-consuming. High-integrity app stores must provide stronger guarantees that their apps are not malicious. We propose a verification model for use in such app stores to guarantee that the apps are free of malicious information flows. In our model, the software vendor and the app store auditor collaborate -- each does tasks that are easy for her/him, reducing overall verification cost. The software vendor provides a behavioral specification of information flow (at a finer granularity than used by current app stores) and source code annotated with information-flow type qualifiers. A flow-sensitive, context-sensitive information-flow type system checks the information flow type qualifiers in the source code and proves that only information flows in the specification can occur at run time. The app store auditor uses the vendor-provided source code to manually verify declassifications.We have implemented the information-flow type system for Android apps written in Java, and we evaluated both its effectiveness at detecting information-flow violations and its usability in practice. In an adversarial Red Team evaluation, we analyzed 72 apps (576,000 LOC) for malware. The 57 Trojans among these had been written specifically to defeat a malware analysis such as ours. Nonetheless, our information-flow type system was effective: it detected 96\% of malware whose malicious behavior was related to information flow and 82\% of all malware. In addition to the adversarial evaluation, we evaluated the practicality of using the collaborative model. The programmer annotation burden is low: 6 annotations per 100 LOC. Every sound analysis requires a human to review potential false alarms, and in our experiments, this took 30 minutes per 1,000 LOC for an auditor unfamiliar with the app.},

	abstract     = {Mobile operating systems like Android failed to provide sufficient protection on personal data, and privacy leakage becomes a major concern. To understand the security risks and privacy leakage, analysts have to carry out data-flow analysis. In 2014, Android upgraded with a fundamentally new design known as Android RunTime (ART) environment in Android 5.0. ART adopts ahead-of-time compilation strategy and replaces previous virtual-machine-based Dalvik. Unfortunately, many data-flow analysis systems like TaintDroid were designed for the legacy Dalvik environment. This makes data-flow analysis of new apps and malware infeasible. We design a multi-level information-flow tracking system for the new Android system called TaintART. TaintART employs a multi-level taint analysis technique to minimize the taint tag storage. Therefore, taint tags can be stored in processor registers to provide efficient taint propagation operations. We also customize the ART compiler to maximize performance gains of the ahead-of-time compilation optimizations. Based on the general design of TaintART, we also implement a multi-level privacy enforcement to prevent sensitive data leakage. We demonstrate that TaintART only incurs less than 15\% overheads on a CPU-bound microbenchmark and negligible overhead on built-in or third-party applications. Compared to legacy Dalvik environment in Android 4.4, TaintART achieves about 99.7\% faster performance for Java runtime benchmark.},

However, Android based applications are highly vulnerable to various types of malware attacks attributed to their open nature and high popularity in the market. The fault lies in the underneath permission model of Android applications. These applications need a number of sensitive permissions during their installation and runtime, which enables possible security breaches by malware. The contributions of this paper are twofold: 1) We extract a set of 123 dynamic permissions from 11000 Android applications in a largest publicly available dataset till date; 2) We evaluate a number of machine learning classification techniques including Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (J48), Random Forest (RF), Simple Logistic (SL), and k-star on the newly designed dataset for detecting malicious Android applications. The experimental results indicate that although the malware classification accuracy of RF, J48, and SL are comparable, SL performs marginally better than the other techniques.},

Features indicative of malware are automatically learned by the network from the raw opcode sequence thus removing the need for hand-engineered malware features. The training pipeline of our proposed system is much simpler than existing n-gram based malware detection methods, as the network is trained end-to-end to jointly learn appropriate features and to perform classification, thus removing the need to explicitly enumerate millions of n-grams during training. The network design also allows the use of long n-gram like features, not computationally feasible with existing methods. Once trained, the network can be efficiently executed on a GPU, allowing a very large number of files to be scanned quickly.},

In this paper, we provide the first approach for automatically generating exploits for Android apps, called LetterBomb, relying on a combined path-sensitive symbolic execution-based static analysis, and the use of software instrumentation and test oracles. We run LetterBomb on 10,000 Android apps from Google Play, where we identify 181 exploits from 835 vulnerable apps. Compared to a state-of-the-art detection approach for three ICC-based vulnerabilities, LetterBomb obtains 33%-60% more vulnerabilities at a 6.66 to 7 times faster speed.},

Ensuring their correctness and reliability thus becomes an important challenge. This paper introduces Stoat, a novel guided approach to perform stochastic model-based testing on Android apps. Stoat operates in two phases: (1) Given an app as input, it uses dynamic analysis enhanced by a weighted UI exploration strategy and static analysis to reverse engineer a stochastic model of the app's GUI interactions; and (2) it adapts Gibbs sampling to iteratively mutate/refine the stochastic model and guides test generation from the mutated models toward achieving high code and model coverage and exhibiting diverse sequences. During testing, system-level events are randomly injected to further enhance the testing effectiveness. Stoat was evaluated on 93 open-source apps. The results show (1) the models produced by Stoat cover 17~31\% more code than those by existing modeling tools; (2) Stoat detects 3X more unique crashes than two state-of-the-art testing tools, Monkey and Sapienz. Furthermore, Stoat tested 1661 most popular Google Play apps, and detected 2110 previously unknown and unique crashes. So far, 43 developers have responded that they are investigating our reports. 20 of reported crashes have been confirmed, and 8 already fixed.},

Anti-malware products aim to protect smartphone users from these threats, especially from malicious apps. However, malware authors use code obfuscation on their apps to evade detection by anti-malware products. To assess the effects of code obfuscation on Android apps and anti-malware products, we have conducted a large-scale empirical study that evaluates the effectiveness of the top anti-malware products against various obfuscation tools and strategies. To that end, we have obfuscated 3,000 benign apps and 3,000 malicious apps and generated 73,362 obfuscated apps using 29 obfuscation strategies from 7 open-source, academic, and commercial obfuscation tools. The findings of our study indicate that (1) code obfuscation significantly impacts Android anti-malware products; (2) the majority of anti-malware products are severely impacted by even trivial obfuscations; (3) in general, combined obfuscation strategies do not successfully evade anti-malware products more than individual strategies; (4) the detection of anti-malware products depend not only on the applied obfuscation strategy but also on the leveraged obfuscation tool; (5) anti-malware products are slow to adopt signatures of malicious apps; and (6) code obfuscation often results in changes to an app's semantic behaviors.},

Past work focused on automated test generation to detect crashes in Android apps. However, automated repair of crashes has not been studied. In this paper, we propose the first approach to automatically repair Android apps, specifically we propose a technique for fixing crashes in Android apps. Unlike most test-based repair approaches, we do not need a test-suite; instead a single failing test is meticulously analyzed for crash locations and reasons behind these crashes. Our approach hinges on a careful empirical study which seeks to establish common root-causes for crashes in Android apps, and then distills the remedy of these root-causes in the form of eight generic transformation operators. These operators are applied using a search-based repair framework embodied in our repair tool Droix. We also prepare a benchmark DroixBench capturing reproducible crashes in Android apps. Our evaluation of Droix on DroixBench reveals that the automatically produced patches are often syntactically identical to the human patch, and on some rare occasion even better than the human patch (in terms of avoiding regressions). These results confirm our intuition that our proposed transformations form a sufficient set of operators to patch crashes in Android.},

Mobile platform providers are constantly creating and refining their malware-detection techniques, including static analysis and behavioral monitoring. The goal of malware writers is to hide the malware payload from those analyzers. In parallel, security analysts want to quickly detect if any software is malware in order to prevent harm to users. This confrontation is pushing malware writers to develop new evasion techniques that prevent their malware from being detected or making analysis harder.This paper describes ARES, a system built on top of an existing behavioral analysis, based on static information-flow analysis, binary instrumentation, and multiexecution analysis, to detect and bypass many common evasive techniques used by mobile malware. Additionally, this paper presents our implementation of ARES, and shows that, when run against real-world software, ARES is able to reveal previously unknown malicious components.

Static analysis approaches suffer from false positives whereas dynamic analysis approaches suffer from false negatives. Moreover, they all lack the ability to efficiently analyze systems with incremental changes—such as adding/removing apps, granting/revoking permissions, and dynamic components’ communications. Each time the system changes, the entire analysis needs to be repeated, making the existing approaches inefficient for practical use. To mitigate their shortcomings, we have developed SALMA, a novel self-protecting Android software system that monitors itself and adapts its behavior at runtime to prevent a wide-range of security risks. SALMA maintains a precise architectural model, represented as a Multiple-Domain-Matrix, and incrementally and efficiently analyzes an Android system in response to incremental system changes. The maintained architecture is used to reason about the running Android system. Every time the system changes, SALMA determines (1) the impacted part of the system, and (2) the subset of the security analyses that need to be performed, thereby greatly improving the performance of the approach. Our experimental results on hundreds of real-world apps corroborate SALMA’s scalability and efficiency as well as its ability to detect and prevent security attacks at runtime with minimal disruption.},

	abstract     = {Android apps are prone to crash. This often arises from the misuse of Android framework APIs, making it harder to debug since official Android documentation does not discuss thoroughly potential exceptions.Recently, the program repair community has also started to investigate the possibility to fix crashes automatically. Current results, however, apply to limited example cases. In both scenarios of repair, the main issue is the need for more example data to drive the fix processes due to the high cost in time and effort needed to collect and identify fix examples. We propose in this work a scalable approach, CraftDroid, to mine crash fixes by leveraging a set of 28 thousand carefully reconstructed app lineages from app markets, without the need for the app source code or issue reports. We developed a replicative testing approach that locates fixes among app versions which output different runtime logs with the exact same test inputs. Overall, we have mined 104 relevant crash fixes, further abstracted 17 fine-grained fix templates that are demonstrated to be effective for patching crashed apks. Finally, we release ReCBench, a benchmark consisting of 200 crashed apks and the crash replication scripts, which the community can explore for evaluating generated crash-inducing bug patches.},

	abstract     = {Most programming languages support foreign language interoperation that allows developers to integrate multiple modules implemented in different languages into a single multilingual program. While utilizing various features from multiple languages expands expressivity, differences in language semantics require developers to understand the semantics of multiple languages and their inter-operation. Because current compilers do not support compile-time checking for interoperation, they do not help developers avoid interoperation bugs. Similarly, active research on static analysis and bug detection has been focusing on programs written in a single language.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to analyze multilingual programs statically. Unlike existing approaches that extend a static analyzer for a host language to support analysis of foreign function calls, our approach extracts semantic summaries from programs written in guest languages using a modular analysis technique, and performs a whole-program analysis with the extracted semantic summaries. To show practicality of our approach, we design and implement a static analyzer for multilingual programs, which analyzes JNI interoperation between Java and C. Our empirical evaluation shows that the analyzer is scalable in that it can construct call graphs for large programs that use JNI interoperation, and useful in that it found 74 genuine interoperation bugs in real-world Android JNI applications.},

We show that the Java Native Interface (JNI) specification, which is used by Java programs to interoperate with Java code, is principled enough to permit static reasoning about the effects of native code on program execution when it comes to call-backs. Our approach consists of disassembling native binaries, recovering static symbol information that corresponds to Java method signatures, and producing a model for statically exercising these native call-backs with appropriate mock objects. The approach manages to recover virtually all Java calls in native code, for both Android and Java desktop applications—(a) achieving 100\% native-to-application call-graph recall on large Android applications (Chrome, Instagram) and (b) capturing the full native call-back behavior of the XCorpus suite programs.},

	abstract     = {Android developers heavily use reflection in their apps for legitimate reasons. However, reflection is also significantly used for hiding malicious actions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art static analysis tools for Android are challenged by the presence of reflective calls, which they usually ignore. Thus, the results of their security analysis, e.g., for private data leaks, are incomplete, given the measures taken by malware writers to elude static detection. We propose a new instrumentation-based approach to address this issue in a non-invasive way. Specifically, we introduce to the community a prototype tool called DroidRA, which reduces the resolution of reflective calls to a composite constant propagation problem and then leverages the COAL solver to infer the values of reflection targets. After that, it automatically instruments the app to replace reflective calls with their corresponding Java calls in a traditional paradigm. Our approach augments an app so that it can be more effectively statically analyzable, including by such static analyzers that are not reflection-aware. We evaluate DroidRA on benchmark apps as well as on real-world apps, and we demonstrate that it can indeed infer the target values of reflective calls and subsequently allow state-of-the-art tools to provide more sound and complete analysis results.},

abstract={Third-party libraries are a key building block in software development as they allow developers to reuse common functionalities instead of reinventing the wheel. However, third-party libraries and client projects are developed and continuously evolving in an asynchronous way. As a result, outdated third-party libraries might be commonly used in client projects, while developers are unaware of the potential risk (e.g., security bugs) in usages. Outdated third-party libraries might be updated in client projects in a delayed way, while developers are less aware of the potential risk (e.g., API incompatibilities) in updates. Developers of third-party libraries may be unaware of how their third-party libraries are used or updated in client projects. Therefore, a quantitative and holistic study on usages, updates and risks of third-party libraries in open-source projects can provide concrete evidence on these problems, and practical insights to improve the ecosystem sustainably. In this paper, we make the first contribution towards such a study in the Java ecosystem. First, using 806 open-source projects and 13,565 third-party libraries, we conduct a library usage analysis (e.g., usage intensity and usage outdatedness), followed by a library update analysis (e.g., update intensity and update delay). The two analyses aim to quantify usage and update practices from the two holistic perspectives of open-source projects and third-party libraries. Then, we carry out a library risk analysis (e.g., usage risk and update risk) on 806 open-source projects and 544 security bugs. This analysis aims to quantify the potential risk of using and updating outdated third-party libraries with respect to security bugs. Our findings suggest practical implications to developers and researchers on problems and potential solutions in maintaining third-party libraries (e.g., smart alerting and automated updating of outdated third-party libraries). To demonstrate the usefulness of our findings, we propose a security bug-driven alerting system, named LibSecurify, for assisting developers to make confident decisions by quantifying risks and effort when updating outdated third-party libraries. 33 open-source projects have confirmed the presence of security bugs after receiving our alerts, and 24 of those 33 have updated their third-party libraries. We have released our dataset to foster valuable applications and improve the Java third-party library ecosystem.},

Furthermore, code coverage is used as a fitness function for guiding evolutionary and fuzzy testing techniques. However, there are no reliable tools for measuring fine-grained code coverage in black-box Android app testing.We present the Android Code coVerage Tool, ACVTool for short, that instruments Android apps and measures code coverage in the black-box setting at class, method and instruction granularity. ACVTool has successfully instrumented 96.9\% of apps in our experiments. It introduces a negligible instrumentation time overhead, and its runtime overhead is acceptable for automated testing tools. We demonstrate practical value of ACVTool in a large-scale experiment with Sapienz, a state-of-the-art automated testing tool. Using ACVTool on the same cohort of apps, we have compared different coverage granularities applied by Sapienz in terms of the found amount of crashes. Our results show that none of the applied coverage granularities clearly outperforms others in this aspect.},

We introduce SPARK, a flexible framework for experimenting with points-to analyses for Java. SPARK supports equality- and subset-based analyses, variations in field sensitivity, respect for declared types, variations in call graph construction, off-line simplification, and several solving algorithms. SPARK is composed of building blocks on which new analyses can be based.We demonstrate SPARK in a substantial study of factors affecting precision and efficiency of subset-based points-to analyses, including interactions between these factors. Our results show that SPARK is not only flexible and modular, but also offers superior time/space performance when compared to other points-to analysis implementations.},

To defend against this severe increase of Android malwares and help users make a better evaluation of apps at install time, several approaches have been proposed. However, most of these solutions suffer from some shortcomings; computationally expensive, not general or not robust enough. In this paper, we aim to mitigate Android malware installation through providing robust and lightweight classifiers. We have conducted a thorough analysis to extract relevant features to malware behavior captured at API level, and evaluated different classifiers using the generated feature set. Our results show that we are able to achieve an accuracy as high as 99{\%} and a false positive rate as low as 2.2{\%} using KNN classifier.",

In this paper, we reduce the discovery of inter-component communication (ICC) in smartphones to an instance of the Interprocedural Distributive Environment (IDE) problem, and develop a sound static analysis technique targeted to the Android platform. We apply this analysis to 1,200 applications selected from the Play store and characterize the locations and substance of their ICC. Experiments show that full specifications for ICC can be identified for over 93\% of ICC locations for the applications studied. Further the analysis scales well; analysis of each application took on average 113 seconds to complete. Epicc, the resulting tool, finds ICC vulnerabilities with far fewer false positives than the next best tool. In this way, we develop a scalable vehicle to extend current security analysis to entire collections of applications as well as the interfaces they export.},

Automated dynamic malware analysis is a widely-adopted approach for detecting malicious software. However, many recent malware samples try to evade detection by identifying the presence of the analysis environment itself, and refraining from performing malicious actions. Because of the sophistication of the techniques used by the malware authors, so far the analysis and detection of evasive malware has been largely a manual process. One approach to automatic detection of these evasive malware samples is to execute the same sample in multiple analysis environments, and then compare its behaviors, in the assumption that a deviation in the behavior is evidence of an attempt to evade one or more analysis systems. For this reason, it is important to provide a reference system (often called bare-metal) in which the malware is analyzed without the use of any detectable component.In this paper, we present BareCloud, an automated evasive malware detection system based on bare-metal dynamic malware analysis. Our bare-metal analysis system does not introduce any in-guest monitoring component into the malware execution platform. This makes our approach more transparent and robust against sophisticated evasion techniques. We compare the malware behavior observed in the bare-metal system with other popular malware analysis systems. We introduce a novel approach of hierarchical similarity-based malware behavior comparison to analyze the behavior of a sample in the various analysis systems. Our experiments show that our approach produces better evasion detection results compared to previous methods. BareCloud was able to automatically detect 5,835 evasive malware out of 110,005 recent samples.},

We develop the first generic solver that infers all possible values of complex objects in an interprocedural, flow and context-sensitive manner, taking field correlations into account. Composite constant propagation problems are specified using COAL, a declarative language. We apply our COAL solver to the problem of inferring Android Inter-Component Communication (ICC) values, which is required to understand how the components of Android applications interact. Using COAL, we model ICC objects in Android more thoroughly than the state-of-the-art. We compute ICC values for 460 applications from the Play store. The ICC values we infer are substantially more precise than previous work. The analysis is efficient, taking slightly over two minutes per application on average. While this work can be used as the basis for many whole-program analyses of Android applications, the COAL solver can also be used to infer the values of composite objects in many other contexts.},

At installation, this application is given permission to (1) access the Internet (for updating wallpapers) and (2) use the device microphone (to change background following noise changes). With these permissions, the application could silently record user conversations and upload them remotely. To give more confidence about how Shake Them All actually processes what it records, it is necessary to build a precise analysis tool that tracks the flow of any sensitive data from its source point to any sink, especially if those are in different components.Since Android applications may leak private data carelessly or maliciously, we propose IccTA, a static taint analyzer to detect privacy leaks among components in Android applications. IccTA goes beyond state-of-the-art approaches by supporting inter-component detection. By propagating context information among components, IccTA improves the precision of the analysis. IccTA outperforms existing tools on two benchmarks for ICC-leak detectors: DroidBench and ICC-Bench. Moreover, our approach detects 534 ICC leaks in 108 apps from MalGenome and 2,395 ICC leaks in 337 apps in a set of 15,000 Google Play apps.},

A crucial requirement for building sustainable learning models, though, is to train on a wide variety of malware samples. Unfortunately, malware evolves rapidly and it thus becomes hard--if not impossible--to generalize learning models to reflect future, previously-unseen behaviors. Consequently, most malware classifiers become unsustainable in the long run, becoming rapidly antiquated as malware continues to evolve. In this work, we propose Transcend, a framework to identify aging classification models in vivo during deployment, much before the machine learning model's performance starts to degrade. This is a significant departure from conventional approaches that retrain aging models retrospectively when poor performance is observed. Our approach uses a statistical comparison of samples seen during deployment with those used to train the model, thereby building metrics for prediction quality. We show how Transcend can be used to identify concept drift based on two separate case studies on Android and Windows malware, raising a red flag before the model starts making consistently poor decisions due to out-of-date training.},

We describe the motivation for each representation, and the salient points in translating from one representation to another.In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework, we have implemented intraprocedural and whole program optimizations. To show that whole program bytecode optimization can give performance improvements, we provide experimental results for 12 large benchmarks, including 8 SPECjvm98 benchmarks running on JDK 1.2 for GNU/Linuxtm. These results show up to 8\% improvement when the optimized bytecode is run using the interpreter and up to 21\% when run using the JIT compiler.}

A large number of those applications are created by a small number of professional underground actors; however previous studies overlooked such information as a feature in detecting and classifying malware and in attributing malware to creators. Guided by this insight, we propose a method to improve the performance of Android malware detection by incorporating the creator's information as a feature and classify malicious applications into similar groups. We developed a system that implements this method in practice. Our system enables fast detection of malware by using creator information such as serial number of certificate. Additionally, it analyzes malicious behaviors and permissions to increase detection accuracy. The system also can classify malware based on similarity scoring. Finally, we showed detection and classification performance with 98\% and 90\% accuracy, respectively.}

We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a function f that is positive on S and negative on the complement. The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm. The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabeled data.}

A key component and contribution of our work is the careful modeling of the stack of currently-active windows, the changes to this stack, and the effects of callbacks related to these changes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed study of this important static analysis problem for Android. We develop novel analysis algorithms for WTG construction and traversal, based on this modeling of the window stack. We also describe an application of the WTG for GUI test generation, using path traversals. The evaluation of the proposed algorithms indicates their effectiveness and practicality.},

	abstract     = {Android applications consist of different components, interacting with each other, developed in different programming languages. While Java is at the core of an Android app, it may require to interact with the web or perform low-level Operating System (OS) operations. For example, Android Webviews are in-app browsers that expose interfaces to the JavaScript in the web page loaded to communicate with Java. Similarly, Android supports native code components that Java invokes via the Java Native Interface (JNI) framework. The ways of interaction of these components may introduce new security concerns the analyses need to address. Unfortunately, work so far has not addressed these mechanisms, compromising on precision and leaving potential security-critical bugs undiscovered.In this thesis, we propose new techniques to enable existing analyses to consider the multi-language nature of an Android application. First, we focus on Android Webviews. To this end, we developed BabelView, a tool that uses information flow analysis to assess the security of Web- views. Our idea is that we can make reasoning about JavaScript semantics unnecessary by instrumenting the application with a model of possible attacker behavior – the BabelView. We evaluated our approach on a sample of 25,000 apps from the Google Play Store, finding 10,808 potential vulnerabilities in 4,997 apps, having over 3 billion installations worldwide. We manually validated BabelView on a sample of 50 apps and estimated our fully automated analysis achieves a precision of 81\% at a recall of 89\%.Second, we focus on enabling analyses for Android native code. We created a new framework, JniFuzzer, which enables fuzzing for Android JNIs. We used JniFuzzer on real-world Android apps, finding potential vulnerabilities that we report as case studies. We then developed TaintSaviour, a Proof of Concept (PoC) tool which uses a black-box approach to generate summaries for JNIs. We implemented TaintSaviour as a plug-in of JniFuzzer, and we present a preliminary evaluation showing that our approach is viable and practical.},

This class of probable problems includes—but is not limited to—the classical separable problems (also known as “gen/kill” or “bit-vector” problems)—e.g., reaching definitions, available expressions, and live variables. In addition, the class of problems that our techniques handle includes many non-separable problems, including truly-live variables, copy constant propagation, and possibly-uninitialized variables.Results are reported from a preliminary experimental study of C programs (for the problem of finding possibly-uninitialized variables).},

abstract = {Third-party libraries (TPLs) have become a significant part of the Android ecosystem. Developers can employ various TPLs with different functionalities to facilitate their app development. Unfortunately, the popularity of TPLs also brings new challenges and even threats. TPLs may carry malicious or vulnerable code, which can infect popular apps to pose threats to mobile users. Besides, the code of third-party libraries could constitute noises in some downstream tasks (e.g., malware and repackaged app detection). Thus, researchers have developed various tools to identify TPLs. However, no existing work has studied these TPL detection tools in detail; different tools focus on different applications with performance differences, but little is known about them.To better understand existing TPL detection tools and dissect TPL detection techniques, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to fill the gap by evaluating and comparing all publicly available TPL detection tools based on four criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, code obfuscation-resilience capability, and ease of use. We reveal their advantages and disadvantages based on a systematic and thorough empirical study. Furthermore, we also conduct a user study to evaluate the usability of each tool. The results show that LibScout outperforms others regarding effectiveness, LibRadar takes less time than others and is also regarded as the most easy-to-use one, and LibPecker performs the best in defending against code obfuscation techniques. We further summarize the lessons learned from different perspectives, including users, tool implementation, and researchers. Besides, we enhance these open-sourced tools by fixing their limitations to improve their detection ability. We also build an extensible framework that integrates all existing available TPL detection tools, providing online service for the research community. We make publicly available the evaluation dataset and enhanced tools. We believe our work provides a clear picture of existing TPL detection techniques and also give a road-map for future directions.},

abstract = {Third-party libraries are vital components of Android apps, yet they can also introduce serious security threats and impede the accuracy and reliability of app analysis tasks, such as app clone detection. Several library detection approaches have been proposed to address these problems. However, we show these techniques are not robust against popular code obfuscators, such as ProGuard, which is now used in nearly half of all apps. We then present LibID, a library detection tool that is more resilient to code shrinking and package modification than state-of-the-art tools. We show that the library identification problem can be formulated using binary integer programming models. LibID is able to identify specific versions of third-party libraries in candidate apps through static analysis of app binaries coupled with a database of third-party libraries. We propose a novel approach to generate synthetic apps to tune the detection thresholds. Then, we use F-Droid apps as the ground truth to evaluate LibID under different obfuscation settings, which shows that LibID is more robust to code obfuscators than state-of-the-art tools. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of LibID by detecting the use of a vulnerable version of the OkHttp library in nearly 10\% of 3,958 most popular apps on the Google Play Store.},

	abstract = {Security of Android devices is now paramount, given their wide adoption among consumers. As researchers develop tools for statically or dynamically detecting suspicious apps, malware writers regularly update their attack mechanisms to hide malicious behavior implementation. This poses two problems to current research techniques: static analysis approaches, given their over-approximations, can report an overwhelming number of false alarms, while dynamic approaches will miss those behaviors that are hidden through evasion techniques. We propose in this work a static approach specifically targeted at highlighting hidden sensitive operations, mainly sensitive data flows. The prototype version of HiSenDroid has been evaluated on a large-scale dataset of thousands of malware and goodware samples on which it successfully revealed anti-analysis code snippets aiming at evading detection by dynamic analysis. We further experimentally show that, with FlowDroid, some of the hidden sensitive behaviors would eventually lead to private data leaks. Those leaks would have been hard to spot either manually among the large number of false positives reported by the state of the art static analyzers, or by dynamic tools. Overall, by putting the light on hidden sensitive operations, HiSenDroid helps security analysts in validating potential sensitive data operations, which would be previously unnoticed.},
