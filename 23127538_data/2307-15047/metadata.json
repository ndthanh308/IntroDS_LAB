  "abstract": "The generation and control of entanglement in a quantum mechanical system is a critical element of nearly all quantum applications. Molecular systems are a promising candidate, with numerous degrees of freedom able to be targeted. However, knowledge of inter-system entanglement mechanisms in such systems is limited. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of entanglement between vibrational degrees of freedom in molecules via strong coupling to a cavity mode driven by a weak coherent field. In a bi-molecular system, we show entanglement can not only be generated between the cavity and molecular system, but also between molecules. This process also results in the generation of non-classical states of light, providing potential pathways for harnessing entanglement in molecular systems.",
