These geometrical variations included parameters such as wing leading-edge sweep, several chord-wise elements, addition of trailing edge flaps and of side fins. The main advantage of the numerical computations was to allow for the investigation of a large number of wing geometries without an expensive and lengthy fabrication process of similar wind-tunnel models. Results of this study indicate that complying with the current Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) regulations, a rear wing with a lift coefficient on the order of −2.2 (based on wing's reference area) is possible.}

Thomas algebraic models, the Baldwin–Barth and Spalart–Allmaras one-equation models, five low-Reynolds-number k–ε models and the Menter SST blended k–ε/k–ω model are examined. A zonal, upwind, implicit, factored algorithm is used to solve both the mean flow equations and the turbulence model equations for three-dimensional, compressible turbulent flow. Calculations are presented for both internal and external flowfields including a two-stream mixing layer, a supersonic flat-plate boundary layer, a transonic supercritical airfoil, a shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction, an ejector nozzle, a highly offset diffuser, and a twin impinging jet flowfield. The influence of two modifications to the production of turbulent kinetic energy for the low-Reynolds-number k–ε models is evaluated, a vorticity-based strain rate and a production limiter. A compressibility correction for high speed shear layers is also examined. Comparisons of the results of the various turbulence models are made with experimental measurements. Significant differences are observed in the model predictions when applied to the same problem using the same computational mesh and mean flow solver. The algebraic models are unable to capture the physics of these complex flowfields, particularly for the internal flow calculations. The performance of each model is dependent on the application. No universal model is found for all flowfields examined. Each one-equation and two-equation model has specific strengths and weaknesses and the performance of each model is assessed.}

The use of generalized wall functions together with the standard k-ε model seems to work well even if the grid refinement extends into the viscous sublayer. In addition, the grid convergence index and other standard uncertainty measures are compared, and a new uncertainty measure is suggested which seems to be a better indicator for the grid convergence error.}",

abstract = {In this paper, the powerful advantages of Open Application Programming Interface (OAPI) in SAP2000 software, known as an excellent tool to solve structural engineering problems, are exploited to establish a new technique of finite element (FE) model updating. This technique is based on the development of a successful sub-program, which can link programming language of MATLAB with SAP2000 through the OAPI library. Therefore, the two-way data exchange between MATLAB and SAP2000 can be continuously secured, and the process of modification of the initial FE model in SAP2000 is implemented by coding instead of using the standard point-and-click procedure in SAP2000′s interface. The damage identification process in structures is then done using an optimization algorithm, named a modified version Cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, and called new balance of Cuckoo search (NB-CS). The key factor in NB-CS is to create a balance between two values: the best global and the worst global. To achieve this balance, NB-CS proposes two main contributions. The first is based on the modification of the concept of a random walk whose step lengths obey Lévy distribution. Whereas, the second is to establish a new balance vector, which is presented based on the global optimal and the worse optimal exploited at each iteration. This vector is combined with each step length to establish a new movement strategy, which is more flexible and more intelligent than that of the original CS. To examine NB-CS's reliability, the first 23 classical benchmark functions are selected to illustrate the convergence rate and level of accuracy of NB-CS compared to the original CS. To authenticate the efficiency of the proposed method, three models, including square shell structure, parabolic domes, and partial sphere shell structure, are investigated for different damage cases. NB-CS is then employed to minimize the objective function with design variables related to the extent and location of damage in thin-shell elements in the structures. The statistical results show the feasible performance of NB-CS in a widespread class of optimization problems and its great potential for application to structural damage identification.}

According to the duality between points and planes in 3D projective space, the GDHBS shape optimization problem is formulated as an arc length, energy and curvature variation minimization problem of dual curve, respectively. Then, an adaptive CS optimization algorithm is applied to the solutions of those GDHBS shape optimization models. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed methods by some representative and convictive examples.}

More specifically, constant parameters of the algorithm, such as the probability of the alien egg being discovered by the host bird and the step size of Levy flights have been dynamically tuned. In addition, static and dynamic penalty functions are introduced within the optimization formulation. Finally, a hybrid optimization approach is developed to combine the advantages of CS with those of Bird Swarm Algorithm (BSA). Benchmark problems, widely used in relevant studies, have been solved and the obtained solutions are compared with those previously reported using the standard CS algorithm and other popular evolutionary optimization techniques (i.e., Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, etc.).}

abstract = {In the present work, three recently developed metaheuristic algorithms (ant colony optimization, cuckoo search and particle swarm optimization) are examined for a class of heat transfer problems. Unknown boundary heat fluxes are estimated for conduction, convection and coupled conduction–radiation problems. Direct problems are solved to determine temperature distribution assuming known boundary heat flux. Inverse method is then used to estimate boundary heat flux with the help of the temperature previously determined from the direct problem. To replicate experimental error, effect of noise on temperature data is introduced to examine the robustness of all the algorithms. Effect of time step size and regularization are studied. It is found that all the algorithms are promising and can be used for this class of inverse heat transfer problems. Performance of all the algorithms is comparable. Efficiency of the three algorithms is compared in terms of CPU time. Ant colony optimization algorithm is found to be most efficient followed by particle swarm optimization and cuckoo search algorithms for all the considered heat transfer problems. All the algorithms are also applied to estimate diffusion coefficient of a food material (mushroom) using experimental data.}

Firstly, the shape of the blade is parameterized by the third-order Bezier curve, and then a certain number of design schemes in the design space are obtained by the Latin hypercube sampling method and the torque coefficient of each design scheme is evaluated based on CFD simulation, and next a radial basis function surrogate model is constructed based on these design schemes and their torque coefficients, and finally the optimal design scheme is obtained by solving the surrogate model using the marine predator algorithm, and is verified using the CFD simulation. The results show that when the tip speed ratio is 1, the average torque coefficient of the optimized blade obtained by the above method is about 7\% higher than that of the classical semicircular blade, and under other tip speed ratios, the average torque coefficients of the optimized blade is also significantly higher than that of the classical blade. Furthermore, compared with the classical semicircular blade, about 11\% materials can be saved in the manufacturing of the optimized blade.}

abstract = {As the main safety facility on the highway, a guardrail system is very essential for the highway traffics safety. In this paper, the Finite Element (FE) models of the vehicle and the corrugated beam guardrail system were created. Two types of widely used corrugated beam semi-rigid guardrails were simulated, which were the W-beam guardrail and the Thrie-beam guardrail. The collision between the corrugated beam guardrail systems and the vehicle body was analyzed. In the collision process, the snagging effect of the post to the vehicle body was also concerned. Under the considerations of the collision safety and the mechanism of the snagging effect, the multiobjective optimization problem was defined with dimensional sizes of guardrails to be the design variables. And the radial basis function (RBF) was applied to construct the regression models of the analytical objective, which increased the accuracy of fitting. The Pareto set and the optimal solution were obtained. After the optimization design, the W-beam guardrail and Thrie-beam guardrail were both greatly improved, that increased the collision safety between the corrugated beam guardrail and the vehicle body. This kind of analytical method can also be used for the crashworthiness optimization between any other cars and guardrails.}

abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms require large number of function evaluations to locate the global optimum, making it computationally prohibitive on dealing with expensive problems. Surrogate-based optimization methods have shown promising ability on accelerating the convergence speed. However, it is still a challenging work for surrogate-assisted methods to deal with high-dimensional expensive problems because it is hard to approximate the objective function in high-dimensional space. In this paper, a novel radial basis function surrogate model assisted evolutionary algorithm for high-dimensional expensive optimization problems (RSAEH) is proposed. Specifically, the proposed algorithm consists of local search part and surrogate-guided prescreening part. In the local search part, the local surrogate is built by radial basis function with the most promising training sample points, and the optima (or near-optima) is located by optimizer to conduct exact function evaluation. In the surrogate-guided prescreening part, the current best sample point is refined by using sequential quadratic programming, thus guide the mutation direction by using differential evolution operator, and promising offspring prescreened by surrogate model are evaluated using exact function evaluation. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it is tested on benchmark problems with dimension ranging from 30 to 100, as well as a real-world oil reservoir production optimization problem. The proposed algorithm achieved best optimization results on 16 benchmark functions among 21 benchmark function sets in comparison with other algorithms. The performance of RSAEH is competitive especially on 100-D benchmark functions. In addition, RSAEH also showed promising performance on a real-world oil reservoir production optimization problem with 160 variables, in comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms.}

abstract = {This article presents a framework for a surrogate-based stochastic search algorithm for multi-objective and constrained black-box optimization where the objective and constraint function values are outputs of computationally expensive computer simulations. Unlike many other approaches, the proposed framework is not population-based and handles constraints without explicitly using a penalty function. In each iteration, the algorithm constructs or updates response surface models or surrogate models of the objective and constraint functions. Then, it generates multiple random trial points according to some probability distribution over the search space. The surrogate models for the objective and constraint functions are then used to identify the trial points that are predicted to be feasible and nondominated. From this set of trial points, two criteria are used to select the next sample point where the expensive objective and constraint functions will be evaluated. These criteria are the minimum distance of the predicted objective vector of a trial point from the current set of nondominated objective vectors and also the minimum distance of the trial point from previous sample points. The proposed framework is implemented using radial basis function (RBF) surrogate models and compared with alternative methods, including NSGA-II and Uniform Random Search on 28 benchmark test problems. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method is promising for computationally expensive multi-objective and constrained black-box optimization.}

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present a novel hybrid algorithm LSMA-TLBO for solving the numerical and engineering design optimization problems. The proposed algorithm utilizes the features of Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) and the Teaching–Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) to balance the exploitation and exploration ability. In addition, a lévy flight based mutation is introduced in this study to maximize the exploration ability of the algorithm. SMA is one of the meta-heuristic algorithms (MHAs) which mimics the oscillation mechanism of slime mould in nature. It is an efficient technique that has been successfully applied to the complex optimization problems (OPs) due to its global exploration ability. However, despite its popularity, the SMA also suffers from some shortcomings, such as local optima stagnation, slow convergence rate and improper balance between exploitation and exploration. In view of this weaknesses, the hybrid algorithm LSMA-TLBO is proposed considering the good global search ability of SMA, fast convergence of TLBO and the features of the lévy flight based mutation to maximize the exploration ability. The performance of the proposed LSMA-TLBO is evaluated on 23 different benchmark functions including uni-modal and multi-modal problems. In addition, IEEE CEC-C06 2019 test suite and six engineering design problems are also considered to examine the practicable abilities of the proposed method. The results are compared with several recently proposed state-of-the-art algorithms and the simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms other algorithms. Further, the LSMA-TLBO is executed through statistical testing of hypothesis namely Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test. It is concluded that the proposed LSMA-TLBO is more competitive and effective algorithm to solve real-world complex OPs.}

abstract = {In recent years, researchers have been focused on solving optimization problems in order to determine the global optimum. Increasing the dimension of a problem increases its computational cost and complexity as well. In order to solve these types of problems, metaheuristic algorithms are used. The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is one of the most well-known algorithms based on whale hunting behavior. In this paper, the WOA algorithm is combined with the Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), which is based on the principle of trigonometric sine-cosine. The WOA algorithm has superior performance in the exploration phase in contrast with the exploitation phase, whereas the SCA algorithm has weaknesses in the exploitation phase. The levy flight distribution has been used in the hybrid WOA and SCA algorithm to improve these deficiencies. This study introduced a novel hybrid algorithm named WOASCALF. In this algorithm, the search agents' position updates are based on a hybridization of the WOA, SCA, and levy flight. Each of these metaheuristic algorithms has reasonable performance, however, the Levy distribution caused small and large distance leaps in each phase of the algorithm. Thus, it is possible for the appropriate search agent to move in different directions of the search space. The performance of the WOASCALF has been evaluated by the 23 well-known benchmark functions and three real-world engineering problems. The result analysis demonstrates that the exploration ability of WOASCALF has strong superiority over other compared algorithms.}

Fluids Eng., 108, p. 2) and revised in 1993 (1993, “Journal of Fluids Engineering Editorial Policy Statement on the Control of Numerical Accuracy,” ASME J. Fluids Eng., 115, pp. 339–340).

This brief note provides specific guidelines for prospective authors for calculation and reporting of discretization error estimates in CFD simulations where experimental data may or may not be available for comparison. The underlying perspective is that CFD-related studies will eventually aim to predict the outcome of a physical event for which experimental data is not available. It should be emphasized that the requirements outlined in this note do not preclude those already published in the previous two policy statements.

The method provides an objective asymptotic approach to quantification of uncertainty of grid convergence.

The GCI is based upon a grid refinement error estimator derived from the theory of generalized Richardson Extrapolation. It is recommended for use whether or not Richardson Extrapolation is actually used to improve the accuracy, and in some cases even if the conditions for the theory do not strictly hold. A different form of the GCI applies to reporting coarse grid solutions when the GCI is evaluated from a “nearby” problem. The simple formulas may be applied a posteriori by editors and reviewers, even if authors are reluctant to do so.}",

The main inspiration of HHO is the cooperative behavior and chasing style of Harris’ hawks in nature called surprise pounce. In this intelligent strategy, several hawks cooperatively pounce a prey from different directions in an attempt to surprise it. Harris hawks can reveal a variety of chasing patterns based on the dynamic nature of scenarios and escaping patterns of the prey. This work mathematically mimics such dynamic patterns and behaviors to develop an optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed HHO optimizer is checked, through a comparison with other nature-inspired techniques, on 29 benchmark problems and several real-world engineering problems. The statistical results and comparisons show that the HHO algorithm provides very promising and occasionally competitive results compared to well-established metaheuristic techniques.
