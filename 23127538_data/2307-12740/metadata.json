  "abstract": "We present the first experimental application of coherent Raman spectroscopy (CRS) on the ro-vibrational $ν_2$ mode spectrum of methane (CH$_4$). Ultrabroadband femtosecond/picosecond (fs/ps) CRS is performed in the molecular fingerprint region from 1100 to 2000 cm$^{-1}$, employing fs laser-induced filamentation as the supercontinuum generation mechanism to provide the ultrabroadband excitation pulses. We introduce a time-domain model of the CH$_4$ $ν_2$ CRS spectrum, including all five ro-vibrational branches allowed by the selection rules $Δv = 1$, $ΔJ = 0$, $\\pm1$, $\\pm2$; the model includes collisional linewidths, computed according to a modified exponential gap scaling law and validated experimentally. The use of ultrabroadband CRS for in situ monitoring of the CH$_4$ chemistry is demonstrated in a laboratory CH$_4$/air diffusion flame: CRS measurements in the fingerprint region, performed across the laminar flame front, allow the simultaneous detection of molecular oxygen (O$_2$), carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), and molecular hydrogen (H$_2$), along with CH$_4$. Fundamental physicochemical processes, such as H$_2$ production via CH$_4$ pyrolysis, are observed through the Raman spectra of these chemical species. In addition, we demonstrate ro-vibrational CH$_4ν_2$ CRS thermometry, and we validate it against CO$_2$ CRS measurements. The present technique offers an interesting diagnostics approach to in situ measurement of CH$_4$-rich environments, e.g., in plasma reactors for CH$_4$ pyrolysis and H$_2$ production.",
