  "abstract": "We performed the first photometric study of the CSS J003106.8+313347 W Ursae Majoris (W UMa)-type system based on ground-based observations. We extracted times of minima from our observations and proposed a linear ephemeris based on the increasing incline of the orbital period using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The PHOEBE Python code and the MCMC approach were used for the light curve analysis. This system did not need starspots for the light curve analysis. Mass ratio, fillout factor, and inclination were obtained as 0.699, 0.322, and 60.6deg respectively. We also estimated the absolute parameters of the system using the Gaia DR3 parallax method. Therefore, the masses, radii, and luminosities have been determined to be M1=1.675, M2=1.171, R1=1.292, R2=1.097, L1=1.348, and L2=1.221. The orbital angular momentum (J0) of the CSS J003106.8+313347 illustrates that this system is located in a region of contact binaries. The positions of the primary and secondary components on the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram are depicted.",
