	abstract = {Unlike other methods for docking ligands to the rigid 3D structure of a known protein receptor, Glide approximates a complete systematic search of the conformational, orientational, and positional space of the docked ligand. In this search, an initial rough positioning and scoring phase that dramatically narrows the search space is followed by torsionally flexible energy optimization on an OPLS-AA nonbonded potential grid for a few hundred surviving candidate poses. The very best candidates are further refined via a Monte Carlo sampling of pose conformation; in some cases, this is crucial to obtaining an accurate docked pose. Selection of the best docked pose uses a model energy function that combines empirical and force-field-based terms. Docking accuracy is assessed by redocking ligands from 282 cocrystallized PDB complexes starting from conformationally optimized ligand geometries that bear no memory of the correctly docked pose. Errors in geometry for the top-ranked pose are less than 1 Å in nearly half of the cases and are greater than 2 Å in only about one-third of them. Comparisons to published data on rms deviations show that Glide is nearly twice as accurate as GOLD and more than twice as accurate as FlexX for ligands having up to 20 rotatable bonds. Glide is also found to be more accurate than the recently described Surflex method.},

	abstract = {Structure-based docking screens of large compound libraries have become common in early drug and probe discovery. As computer efficiency has improved and compound libraries have grown, the ability to screen hundreds of millions, and even billions, of compounds has become feasible for modest-sized computer clusters. This allows the rapid and cost-effective exploration and categorization of vast chemical space into a subset enriched with potential hits for a given target. To accomplish this goal at speed, approximations are used that result in undersampling of possible configurations and inaccurate predictions of absolute binding energies. Accordingly, it is important to establish controls, as are common in other fields, to enhance the likelihood of success in spite of these challenges. Here we outline best practices and control docking calculations that help evaluate docking parameters for a given target prior to undertaking a large-scale prospective screen, with exemplification in one particular target, the melatonin receptor, where following this procedure led to direct docking hits with activities in the subnanomolar range. Additional controls are suggested to ensure specific activity for experimentally validated hit compounds. These guidelines should be useful regardless of the docking software used. Docking software described in the outlined protocol (DOCK3.7) is made freely available for academic research to explore new hits for a range of targets.},

	abstract = {The drug development process is a major challenge in the pharmaceutical industry since it takes a substantial amount of time and money to move through all the phases of developing of a new drug. One extensively used method to minimize the cost and time for the drug development process is computer-aided drug design (CADD). CADD allows better focusing on experiments, which can reduce the time and cost involved in researching new drugs. In this context, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is robust and useful and is one of the most promising in silico techniques for drug design. SBVS attempts to predict the best interaction mode between two molecules to form a stable complex, and it uses scoring functions to estimate the force of non-covalent interactions between a ligand and molecular target. Thus, scoring functions are the main reason for the success or failure of SBVS software. Many software programs are used to perform SBVS, and since they use different algorithms, it is possible to obtain different results from different software using the same input. In the last decade, a new technique of SBVS called consensus virtual screening (CVS) has been used in some studies to increase the accuracy of SBVS and to reduce the false positives obtained in these experiments. An indispensable condition to be able to utilize SBVS is the availability of a 3D structure of the target protein. Some virtual databases, such as the Protein Data Bank, have been created to store the 3D structures of molecules. However, sometimes it is not possible to experimentally obtain the 3D structure. In this situation, the homology modeling methodology allows the prediction of the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. This review presents an overview of the challenges involved in the use of CADD to perform SBVS, the areas where CADD tools support SBVS, a comparison between the most commonly used tools, and the techniques currently used in an attempt to reduce the time and cost in the drug development process. Finally, the final considerations demonstrate the importance of using SBVS in the drug development process.},

Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.},

Using modular message passing graph neural networks describing both the ligand and the protein in their free and bound states, we unambiguously evidence that an explicit description of protein–ligand noncovalent interactions does not provide any advantage with respect to ligand or protein descriptors. Simple models, inferring binding affinities of test samples from that of the closest ligands or proteins in the training set, already exhibit good performances, suggesting that memorization largely dominates true learning in the deep neural networks. The current study suggests considering only noncovalent interactions while omitting their protein and ligand atomic environments. Removing all hidden biases probably requires much denser protein–ligand training matrices and a coordinated effort of the drug design community to solve the necessary protein–ligand structures.},

	abstract = {A crucial component in structure-based drug discovery is the availability of high-quality three-dimensional structures of the protein target. Whenever experimental structures were not available, homology modeling has been, so far, the method of choice. Recently, AlphaFold (AF), an artificial-intelligence-based protein structure prediction method, has shown impressive results in terms of model accuracy. This outstanding success prompted us to evaluate how accurate AF models are from the perspective of docking-based drug discovery. We compared the high-throughput docking (HTD) performance of AF models with their corresponding experimental PDB structures using a benchmark set of 22 targets. The AF models showed consistently worse performance using four docking programs and two consensus techniques. Although AlphaFold shows a remarkable ability to predict protein architecture, this might not be enough to guarantee that AF models can be reliably used for HTD, and post-modeling refinement strategies might be key to increase the chances of success.,

Doing so is a simple way to bias the statistic to favor identification of “hits” early in the recovery curve rather than late. A second suggested modification entails weighting each active based on the size of the lead series to which it belongs. Two weighting schemes are described: arithmetic, in which the weight for each active is inversely proportional to the size of the cluster from which it comes; and harmonic, in which weights are inversely proportional to the rank of each active within its class. Either scheme is able to distinguish biased from unbiased screening statistics, but the harmonically weighted AUC in particular emphasizes the ability to place representatives of each class of active early in the recovery curve.},

In most cases, it is unknown which features in the data are decisive and whether a model's predictions are right for the right reason. Hence, we re-evaluated three widely used benchmark data sets in the context of ML methods and came to the conclusion that not every benchmark data set is suitable. Moreover, we demonstrate on two examples from current literature that bias is learned implicitly and unnoticed from standard benchmarks. On the basis of these results, we conclude that there is a need for eligible validation experiments and benchmark data sets suited to ML for more bias-controlled validation in ML-based SBVS.

	abstract = {Comparative evaluation of virtual screening methods requires a rigorous benchmarking procedure on diverse, realistic, and unbiased data sets. Recent investigations from numerous research groups unambiguously demonstrate that artificially constructed ligand sets classically used by the community (e.g., DUD, DUD-E, MUV) are unfortunately biased by both obvious and hidden chemical biases, therefore overestimating the true accuracy of virtual screening methods. We herewith present a novel data set (LIT-PCBA) specifically designed for virtual screening and machine learning. LIT-PCBA relies on 149 dose–response PubChem bioassays that were additionally processed to remove false positives and assay artifacts and keep active and inactive compounds within similar molecular property ranges. To ascertain that the data set is suited to both ligand-based and structure-based virtual screening, target sets were restricted to single protein targets for which at least one X-ray structure is available in complex with ligands of the same phenotype (e.g., inhibitor, inverse agonist) as that of the PubChem active compounds. Preliminary virtual screening on the 21 remaining target sets with state-of-the-art orthogonal methods (2D fingerprint similarity, 3D shape similarity, molecular docking) enabled us to select 15 target sets for which at least one of the three screening methods is able to enrich the top 1\%-ranked compounds in true actives by at least a factor of 2. The corresponding ligand sets (training, validation) were finally unbiased by the recently described asymmetric validation embedding (AVE) procedure to afford the LIT-PCBA data set, consisting of 15 targets and 7844 confirmed active and 407,381 confirmed inactive compounds. The data set mimics experimental screening decks in terms of hit rate (ratio of active to inactive compounds) and potency distribution. It is available online at http://drugdesign.unistra.fr/LIT-PCBA for download and for benchmarking novel virtual screening methods, notably those relying on machine learning.},

However, the dearth of reliable protein-ligand x-ray structures and binding affinity data has required the use of constructed datasets for the training and evaluation of CNN molecular recognition models. Here, we outline various sources of bias in one such widely-used dataset, the Directory of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD-E). We have constructed and performed tests to investigate whether CNN models developed using DUD-E are properly learning the underlying physics of molecular recognition, as intended, or are instead learning biases inherent in the dataset itself. We find that superior enrichment efficiency in CNN models can be attributed to the analogue and decoy bias hidden in the DUD-E dataset rather than successful generalization of the pattern of protein-ligand interactions. Comparing additional deep learning models trained on PDBbind datasets, we found that their enrichment performances using DUD-E are not superior to the performance of the docking program AutoDock Vina. Together, these results suggest that biases that could be present in constructed datasets should be thoroughly evaluated before applying them to machine learning based methodology development.},

	abstract = {The design of novel protein structures remains a challenge in protein engineering for applications across biomedicine and chemistry. In this line of work, a diffusion model over rigid bodies in 3D (referred to as frames) has shown success in generating novel, functional protein backbones that have not been observed in nature. However, there exists no principled methodological framework for diffusion on SE(3), the space of orientation preserving rigid motions in R3, that operates on frames and confers the group invariance. We address these shortcomings by developing theoretical foundations of SE(3) invariant diffusion models on multiple frames followed by a novel framework, FrameDiff, for learning the SE(3) equivariant score over multiple frames. We apply FrameDiff on monomer backbone generation and find it can generate designable monomers up to 500 amino acids without relying on a pretrained protein structure prediction network that has been integral to previous methods. We find our samples are capable of generalizing beyond any known protein structure.},

Equivariance is important to ensure stable and predictable performance in the presence of nuisance transformations of the data input. A positive corollary of equivariance is increased weight-tying within the model. The SE(3)Transformer leverages the beneﬁts of self-attention to operate on large point clouds and graphs with varying number of points, while guaranteeing SE(3)-equivariance for robustness. We evaluate our model on a toy N -body particle simulation dataset, showcasing the robustness of the predictions under rotations of the input. We further achieve competitive performance on two real-world datasets, ScanObjectNN and QM9.

It compares the query protein to members of a database of protein 3D structures and detects with sub-residue precision, structurally similar sites as patterns of physicochemical properties on the protein surface. Using an efficient maximum clique algorithm, the program identifies proteins that share local structural similarities with the query protein and generates structure-based alignments of these proteins with the query. Structural similarity scores are calculated for the query protein's surface residues, and are expressed as different colors on the query protein surface. The algorithm has been used successfully for the detection of protein–protein, protein–small ligand and protein–DNA binding sites.Availability: The software is available, as a web tool, free of charge for academic users at http://probis.cmm.ki.siContact:  dusa@cmm.ki.siSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

With huge data collections available, it becomes feasible to fit scoring functions in a QSAR style, i.e., by defining protein−ligand interaction descriptors and analyzing them with modern machine-learning methods. As in each data modeling ansatz, care has to be taken to validate the model carefully. Here, we show that there are large differences measured in R (0.77 vs 0.46) or R2 (0.59 vs 0.21) for a relatively simple scoring function depending on whether it is validated against the PDBbind core set or validated in a leave-cluster-out cross-validation.

However, current methods of model evaluation are overly optimistic in measuring generalization to new targets, and there does not exist a standard data set of sufficient size to compare performance between models. We present a new data set for structure-based machine learning, the CrossDocked2020 set, with 22.5 million poses of ligands docked into multiple similar binding pockets across the Protein Data Bank, and perform a comprehensive evaluation of grid-based convolutional neural network (CNN) models on this data set. We also demonstrate how the partitioning of the training data and test data can impact the results of models trained with the PDBbind data set, how performance improves by adding more lower-quality training data, and how training with docked poses imparts pose sensitivity to the predicted affinity of a complex. Our best performing model, an ensemble of five densely connected CNNs, achieves a root mean squared error of 1.42 and Pearson R of 0.612 on the affinity prediction task, an AUC of 0.956 at binding pose classification, and a 68.4\% accuracy at pose selection on the CrossDocked2020 set. By providing data splits for clustered cross-validation and the raw data for the CrossDocked2020 set, we establish the first standardized data set for training machine learning models to recognize ligands in noncognate target structures while also greatly expanding the number of poses available for training. In order to facilitate community adoption of this data set for benchmarking protein–ligand binding affinity prediction, we provide our models, weights, and the CrossDocked2020 set at https://github.com/gnina/models.},

	abstract = {Illuminating interactions between proteins and small drug molecules is a long-standing challenge in the field of drug discovery. Despite the importance of understanding these interactions, most previous works are limited by hand-designed scoring functions and insufficient conformation sampling. The recently-proposed graph neural network-based methods provides alternatives to predict protein-ligand complex conformation in a one-shot manner. However, these methods neglect the geometric constraints of the complex structure and weaken the role of local functional regions. As a result, they might produce unreasonable conformations for challenging targets and generalize poorly to novel proteins. In this paper, we propose Trigonometry-Aware Neural networKs for binding structure prediction, TANKBind, that builds trigonometry constraint as a vigorous inductive bias into the model and explicitly attends to all possible binding sites for each protein by segmenting the whole protein into functional blocks. We construct novel contrastive losses with local region negative sampling to jointly optimize the binding interaction and affinity. Extensive experiments show substantial performance gains in comparison to state-of-the-art physics-based and deep learning-based methods on commonly-used benchmark datasets for both binding structure and affinity predictions with variant settings.

We challenge this paradigm with EquiBind, an SE(3)-equivariant geometric deep learning model performing direct-shot prediction of both i) the receptor binding location (blind docking) and ii) the ligand's bound pose and orientation. EquiBind achieves significant speed-ups and better quality compared to traditional and recent baselines. Further, we show extra improvements when coupling it with existing fine-tuning techniques at the cost of increased running time. Finally, we propose a novel and fast fine-tuning model that adjusts torsion angles of a ligand's rotatable bonds based on closed-form global minima of the von Mises angular distance to a given input atomic point cloud, avoiding previous expensive differential evolution strategies for energy minimization.},

Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.},

	abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

In this paper, we present the design principles and implementation of Deep Graph Library (DGL). DGL distills the computational patterns of GNNs into a few generalized sparse tensor operations suitable for extensive parallelization. By advocating graph as the central programming abstraction, DGL can perform optimizations transparently. By cautiously adopting a framework-neutral design, DGL allows users to easily port and leverage the existing components across multiple deep learning frameworks. Our evaluation shows that DGL significantly outperforms other popular GNN-oriented frameworks in both speed and memory consumption over a variety of benchmarks and has little overhead for small scale workloads.},

	abstract = {Molecular docking, given a ligand molecule and a ligand binding site (called ``pocket'') on a protein, predicting the binding mode of the protein-ligand complex, is a widely used technique in drug design. Many deep learning models have been developed for molecular docking, while most existing deep learning models perform docking on the whole protein, rather than on a given pocket as the traditional molecular docking approaches, which does not match common needs. What's more, they claim to perform better than traditional molecular docking, but the approach of comparison is not fair, since traditional methods are not designed for docking on the whole protein without a given pocket. In this paper, we design a series of experiments to examine the actual performance of these deep learning models and traditional methods. For a fair comparison, we decompose the docking on the whole protein into two steps, pocket searching and docking on a given pocket, and build pipelines to evaluate traditional methods and deep learning methods respectively. We find that deep learning models are actually good at pocket searching, but traditional methods are better than deep learning models at docking on given pockets. Overall, our work explicitly reveals some potential problems in current deep learning models for molecular docking and provides several suggestions for future works.},

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Understanding molecular recognition of small molecules by proteins in atomistic detail is key for drug design. Molecular docking is a widely used computational method to mimic ligand–protein association in silico. However, predicting conformational changes occurring in proteins upon ligand binding is still a major challenge. Ensemble docking approaches address this issue by considering a set of different conformations of the protein obtained either experimentally or from computer simulations, e.g., molecular dynamics. However, holo structures prone to host (the correct) ligands are generally poorly sampled by standard molecular dynamics simulations of the apo protein. In order to address this limitation, we introduce a computational approach based on metadynamics simulations called ensemble docking with enhanced sampling of pocket shape (EDES) that allows holo-like conformations of proteins to be generated by exploiting only their apo structures. This is achieved by defining a set of collective variables that effectively sample different shapes of the binding site, ultimately mimicking the steric effect due to the ligand. We assessed the method on three challenging proteins undergoing different extents of conformational changes upon ligand binding. In all cases our protocol generates a significant fraction of structures featuring a low RMSD from the experimental holo geometry. Moreover, ensemble docking calculations using those conformations yielded in all cases native-like poses among the top-ranked ones.},

We report a genome-wide computational analysis of mRNA secondary structure, codon usage, and gene expression in budding yeast. We show that mRNA secondary structure combined with codon optimality regulates gene expression in multiple ways, from transcription to mRNA stability to translation. Moreover, we find that the effect of mRNA secondary structure on mRNA abundance is primarily mediated by transcription, not mRNA stability. Notably, genes with low mRNA secondary structure were substantially enriched for functions relevant to stress response, acting in the mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosome. On the other hand, genes with high mRNA secondary structure were enriched for functions relevant to cellular maintenance, including macromolecular metabolism and biosynthesis. Our results suggest that mRNA secondary structure affects gene expression through coordination of multiple stages in protein biogenesis, with important consequences for stress response. The coupling of transcription to mRNA stability to translation makes concerted changes in mRNA and protein abundance possible and may amplify the effect of regulation to make quick responses to environmental variations.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease and its associated dementia can be caused by elevated levels of α-synuclein protein. Despite many efforts, however, targeting α-synuclein at the protein level has been challenging. In this manuscript, we describe the design of a small molecule that selectively targets the messenger RNA that encodes α-synuclein protein and selectively inhibits its translation. Furthermore, the compound is cytoprotective. Collectively, our findings show that difficult-to-target proteins can indeed be regulated by small molecules by binding the encoding mRNA. This strategy is a potentially promising way to slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease and related neurological disorders., Many proteins are refractory to targeting because they lack small-molecule binding pockets. An alternative to drugging these proteins directly is to target the messenger (m)RNA that encodes them, thereby reducing protein levels. We describe such an approach for the difficult-to-target protein α-synuclein encoded by the SNCA gene. Multiplication of the SNCA gene locus causes dominantly inherited Parkinson’s disease (PD), and α-synuclein protein aggregates in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in sporadic PD. Thus, reducing the expression of α-synuclein protein is expected to have therapeutic value. Fortuitously, the SNCA mRNA has a structured iron-responsive element (IRE) in its 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) that controls its translation. Using sequence-based design, we discovered small molecules that target the IRE structure and inhibit SNCA translation in cells, the most potent of which is named Synucleozid. Both in vitro and cellular profiling studies showed Synucleozid directly targets the α-synuclein mRNA 5′ UTR at the designed site. Mechanistic studies revealed that Synucleozid reduces α-synuclein protein levels by decreasing the amount of SNCA mRNA loaded into polysomes, mechanistically providing a cytoprotective effect in cells. Proteome- and transcriptome-wide studies showed that the compound’s selectivity makes Synucleozid suitable for further development. Importantly, transcriptome-wide analysis of mRNAs that encode intrinsically disordered proteins revealed that each has structured regions that could be targeted with small molecules. These findings demonstrate the potential for targeting undruggable proteins at the level of their coding mRNAs. This approach, as applied to SNCA, is a promising disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for PD and other α-synucleinopathies.},

LncRNAs, originally considered as junk RNA, are dysregulated in various types of cancer. Although protein-coding signaling pathways underlie various biological activities, and abnormal signal transduction is a key trigger and indicator for tumorigenesis and cancer progression, lncRNAs are sparking keen interest due to their versatile roles in fine-tuning signaling pathways. We are just beginning to scratch the surface of lncRNAs. Therefore, despite the fact that lncRNAs drive malignant phenotypes from multiple perspectives, in this review, we focus on important signaling pathways modulated by lncRNAs in cancer to demonstrate an up-to-date understanding of this emerging field.},

Recent studies have begun to unravel how the biogenesis of lncRNAs is distinct from that of mRNAs and is linked with their specific subcellular localizations and functions. Depending on their localization and their specific interactions with DNA, RNA and proteins, lncRNAs can modulate chromatin function, regulate the assembly and function of membraneless nuclear bodies, alter the stability and translation of cytoplasmic mRNAs and interfere with signalling pathways. Many of these functions ultimately affect gene expression in diverse biological and physiopathological contexts, such as in neuronal disorders, immune responses and cancer. Tissue-specific and condition-specific expression patterns suggest that lncRNAs are potential biomarkers and provide a rationale to target them clinically. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms of lncRNA biogenesis, localization and functions in transcriptional, post-transcriptional and other modes of gene regulation, and their potential therapeutic applications.},

The method is based on a coordinate displacement perturbation of the ligand between the receptor binding site and the explicit solvent bulk and a thermodynamic cycle connected by a symmetric intermediate in which the ligand interacts with the receptor and solvent environments with equal strength. While the approach is alchemical, the implementation of the ATM is as straightforward as that for physical pathway methods of binding. The method is applicable, in principle, with any force field, as it does not require splitting the alchemical transformations into electrostatic and nonelectrostatic steps, and it does not require soft-core pair potentials. We have implemented the ATM as a freely available and open-source plugin of the OpenMM molecular dynamics library. The method and its implementation are validated on the SAMPL6 SAMPLing host–guest benchmark set. The work paves the way to streamlined alchemical relative and absolute binding free energy implementations on many molecular simulation packages and with arbitrary energy functions including polarizable, quantum-mechanical, and artificial neural network potentials.},

In addition to crystallographic approaches, computational methods are needed for visualizing the 3D structure of large RNAs. Here, we modeled the molecular structure of the ai5γ group IIB intron from yeast using the crystal structure of a bacterial group IIC homolog. This was accomplished by adapting strategies for homology and de novo modeling, and creating a new computational tool for RNA refinement. The resulting model was validated experimentally using a combination of structure-guided mutagenesis and RNA structure probing. The model provides major insights into the mechanism and regulation of splicing, such as the position of the branch-site before and after the second step of splicing, and the location of subdomains that control target specificity, underscoring the feasibility of modeling large functional RNA molecules.},

Riboswitches control the expression of essential bacterial genes and are important models for RNA-small molecule recognition. Here, we report the discovery of a class of synthetic small molecules that bind to PreQ1 riboswitch aptamers. These molecules bind specifically and reversibly to the aptamers with high affinity and induce a conformational change. Furthermore, the ligands modulate riboswitch activity through transcriptional termination despite no obvious chemical similarity to the cognate ligand. X-ray crystallographic studies reveal that the ligands share a binding site with the cognate ligand but make different contacts. Finally, alteration of the chemical structure of the ligand causes changes in the mode of RNA binding and affects regulatory function. Thus, target- and structure-based approaches can be used to identify and understand the mechanism of synthetic ligands that bind to and regulate complex, folded RNAs.},

The compounds are potent growth inhibitors of the pathogen Candida parapsilosis, displaying antifungal activity comparable to that of amphotericin B.

Using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we show that mRNAs and lncRNAs have an intrinsic propensity to fold in the absence of proteins into structures in which the 5′ end and 3′ end are ≤7 nm apart irrespective of mRNA length. Computational estimates suggest that the inherent proximity of the ends is a universal property of most mRNA and lncRNA sequences. Only guanosine-depleted RNA sequences with low sequence complexity are unstructured and exhibit end-to-end distances expected for the random coil conformation of RNA. While the biological implications remain to be explored, short end-to-end distances could facilitate the binding of protein factors that regulate translation initiation by bridging mRNA 5′ and 3′ ends. Furthermore, our studies provide the basis for measuring, computing and manipulating end-to-end distances and secondary structure in RNA in research and biotechnology.},

The independent contributions of factors like codon usage and secondary structure to regulating protein expression are difficult to establish as they are often highly correlated in endogenous sequences. Here, we used 2 approaches, global inclusion of modified nucleotides and rational sequence design of exogenously delivered constructs, to understand the role of mRNA secondary structure independent from codon usage. Unexpectedly, highly expressed mRNAs contained a highly structured coding sequence (CDS). Modified nucleotides that stabilize mRNA secondary structure enabled high expression across a wide variety of primary sequences. Using a set of eGFP mRNAs with independently altered codon usage and CDS structure, we find that the structure of the CDS regulates protein expression through changes in functional mRNA half-life (i.e., mRNA being actively translated).

As MYC is an oncoprotein whose expression is deregulated in multiple human cancers, identifying its critical downstream activities in tumors is of key importance for designing effective therapeutic strategies. With this knowledge and recent technological advances, we now have multiple angles to reach the goal of targeting MYC in tumors, ranging from the direct reduction of MYC levels, to the dampening of selected house‐keeping functions in MYC‐overexpressing cells, to more targeted approaches based on MYC‐induced secondary effects.},

	abstract = {RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and thus has motivated extensive computational and experimental efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.},

In particular, the ligand's true binding pose is often scored very unfavorably due to apparent clashes between ligand and protein atoms, which lead to extremely high values of the calculated van der Waals energy term. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by explicitly searching for receptor conformations to account for the flexibility of the receptor in ligand binding. Here we present a deep learning model trained to take receptor flexibility into account implicitly when predicting van der Waals energy. We show that incorporating this machine-learned energy term into a state-of-the-art physics-based scoring function improves small molecule ligand pose prediction results in cases with substantial protein deformation, without degrading performance in cases with minimal protein deformation. This work demonstrates the feasibility of learning effects of protein flexibility on ligand binding without explicitly modeling changes in protein structure.},

	abstract = {Motivation
Sequence-order independent structural comparison, also called structural alignment, of small ligand molecules is often needed for computer-aided virtual drug screening. Although many ligand structure alignment programs are proposed, most of them build the alignments based on rigid-body shape comparison which cannot provide atom-specific alignment information nor allow structural variation; both abilities are critical to efficient high-throughput virtual screening.

Results
We propose a novel ligand comparison algorithm, LS-align, to generate fast and accurate atom-level structural alignments of ligand molecules, through an iterative heuristic search of the target function that combines inter-atom distance with mass and chemical bond comparisons. LS-align contains two modules of Rigid-LS-align and Flexi-LS-align, designed for rigid-body and flexible alignments, respectively, where a ligand-size independent, statistics-based scoring function is developed to evaluate the similarity of ligand molecules relative to random ligand pairs. Large-scale benchmark tests are performed on prioritizing chemical ligands of 102 protein targets involving 1 415 871 candidate compounds from the DUD-E (Database of Useful Decoys: Enhanced) database, where LS-align achieves an average enrichment factor (EF) of 22.0 at the 1\% cutoff and the AUC score of 0.75, which are significantly higher than other state-of-the-art methods. Detailed data analyses show that the advanced performance is mainly attributed to the design of the target function that combines structural and chemical information to enhance the sensitivity of recognizing subtle difference of ligand molecules and the introduces of structural flexibility that help capture the conformational changes induced by the ligand–receptor binding interactions. These data demonstrate a new avenue to improve the virtual screening efficiency through the development of sensitive ligand structural alignments.

	abstract = {Colistin (polymyxin E) and polymyxin B have been used as last-resort agents for treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. However, their efficacy has been challenged by the emergence of the mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-1, which encodes a transmembrane phosphoethanolamine (PEA) transferase enzyme, MCR-1. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the cationic PEA moiety of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to lipid A, thereby neutralizing the negative charge of lipid A and blocking the binding of positively charged polymyxins. This study aims to facilitate understanding of the mechanism of the MCR-1 enzyme by investigating its active-site sequence requirements. For this purpose, 23 active-site residues of MCR-1 protein were randomized by constructing single-codon randomization libraries. The libraries were individually selected for supporting Escherichia coli cell growth in the presence of colistin or polymyxin B. Deep sequencing of the polymyxin-resistant clones revealed that wild-type residues predominates at 17 active-site residue positions, indicating these residues play critical roles in MCR-1 function. These residues include Zn2+-chelating residues as well as residues that may form a hydrogen bond network with the PEA moiety or make hydrophobic interactions with the acyl chains of PE. Any mutations at these residues significantly decrease polymyxin resistance levels and the PEA transferase activity of the MCR-1 enzyme. Therefore, deep sequencing of the randomization libraries of MCR-1 enzyme identifies active-site residues that are essential for its polymyxin resistance function. Thus, these residues may be utilized as targets to develop inhibitors to circumvent MCR-1-mediated polymyxin resistance.
IMPORTANCE Polymyxin antibiotics are used as last-line antibiotics in treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. However, widespread use of polymyxins has led to the emergence of resistance. Although multiple mechanisms for resistance exist, that due to mcr-1 is a particular concern, as it can be readily transferred among bacterial pathogens. The mcr-1 gene encodes a transmembrane phosphoethanolamine (PEA) transferase that modifies lipid A to block the binding of polymyxin antibiotics. We utilized random mutagenesis coupled with next-generation sequencing to determine the amino acid sequence requirements of 23 residues in and near the active site of MCR-1. We show that the enzyme has stringent sequence requirements, with 75\% of the residues examined being essential for function. Coupled with the finding that these residues are largely conserved among PEA enzymes, the results suggest inhibitors that bind near these sites will broadly inhibit MCR-1 and other enzymes of this class.},

We present cDNA display proteolysis, a new method for measuring thermodynamic folding stability for up to 900,000 protein domains in a one-week experiment. From 1.8 million measurements in total, we curated a set of ∼850,000 high-quality folding stabilities covering all single amino acid variants and selected double mutants of 354 natural and 188 de novo designed protein domains 40-72 amino acids in length. Using this immense dataset, we quantified (1) environmental factors influencing amino acid fitness, (2) thermodynamic couplings (including unexpected interactions) between protein sites, and (3) the global divergence between evolutionary amino acid usage and protein folding stability. We also examined how our approach could identify stability determinants in designed proteins and evaluate design methods. The cDNA display proteolysis method is fast, accurate, and uniquely scalable, and promises to reveal the quantitative rules for how amino acid sequences encode folding stability.

	abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to be effective models for different predictive tasks on graph-structured data. Recent work on their expressive power has focused on isomorphism tasks and countable feature spaces. We extend this theoretical framework to include continuous features—which occur regularly in real-world input domains and within the hidden layers of GNNs—and we demonstrate the requirement for multiple aggregation functions in this context. Accordingly, we propose Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation (PNA), a novel architecture combining multiple aggregators with degree-scalers (which generalize the sum aggregator). Finally, we compare the capacity of different models to capture and exploit the graph structure via a novel benchmark containing multiple tasks taken from classical graph theory, alongside existing benchmarks from realworld domains, all of which demonstrate the strength of our model. With this work, we hope to steer some of the GNN research towards new aggregation methods which we believe are essential in the search for powerful and robust models.},

Recent deep learning methods that treat docking as a regression problem have decreased runtime compared to traditional search-based methods but have yet to offer substantial improvements in accuracy. We instead frame molecular docking as a generative modeling problem and develop DiffDock, a diffusion generative model over the non-Euclidean manifold of ligand poses. To do so, we map this manifold to the product space of the degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, and torsional) involved in docking and develop an efficient diffusion process on this space. Empirically, DiffDock obtains a 38\% top-1 success rate (RMSD{\textless}2A) on PDBBind, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of traditional docking (23\%) and deep learning (20\%) methods. Moreover, DiffDock has fast inference times and provides confidence estimates with high selective accuracy.},

Specifically, we train a diffusion generative model on protein structures from molecular dynamics simulations, and we show that its score function approximates a force field that can directly be used to simulate CG molecular dynamics. While having a vastly simplified training setup compared to previous work, we demonstrate that our approach leads to improved performance across several small- to medium-sized protein simulations, reproducing the CG equilibrium distribution, and preserving dynamics of all-atom simulations such as protein folding events.},

	abstract = {Over the past five decades, tremendous effort has been devoted to computational methods for predicting properties of ligands—i.e., molecules that bind macromolecular targets. Such methods, which are critical to rational drug design, fall into two categories: physics-based methods, which directly model ligand interactions with the target given the target’s three-dimensional (3D) structure, and ligand-based methods, which predict ligand properties given experimental measurements for similar ligands. Here, we present a rigorous statistical framework to combine these two sources of information. We develop a method to predict a ligand’s pose—the 3D structure of the ligand bound to its target—that leverages a widely available source of information: a list of other ligands that are known to bind the same target but for which no 3D structure is available. This combination of physics-based and ligand-based modeling improves pose prediction accuracy across all major families of drug targets. Using the same framework, we develop a method for virtual screening of drug candidates, which outperforms standard physics-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods. Our results suggest broad opportunities to improve prediction of various ligand properties by combining diverse sources of information through customized machine-learning approaches.},

	abstract = {Solution of the structures of ligand–receptor complexes via computational docking is an integral step in many structural modeling efforts as well as in rational drug discovery. A major challenge in ligand–receptor docking is the modeling of both receptor and ligand flexibilities in order to capture receptor conformational changes induced by ligand binding. In the molecular docking suite MedusaDock, both ligand and receptor side chain flexibilities are modeled simultaneously with sets of discrete rotamers, where the ligand rotamer library is generated “on the fly” in a stochastic manner. Here, we introduce backbone flexibility into MedusaDock by implementing ensemble docking in a sequential manner for a set of distinct receptor backbone conformations. We generate corresponding backbone ensembles to capture backbone changes upon binding to different ligands, as observed experimentally. We develop a simple clustering and ranking approach to select the top poses as blind predictions. We applied our method in the CSAR2011 benchmark exercise. In 28 out of 35 cases (80\%) where the ligand–receptor complex structures were released, we were able to predict near-native poses ({\textless}2.5 Å RMSD), the highest success rate reported for CSAR2011. This result highlights the importance of modeling receptor backbone flexibility to the accurate docking of ligands to flexible targets. We expect a broad application of our fully flexible docking approach in biological studies as well as in rational drug design.},

The PDBbind dataset is the current standard for training such models, but its small size (less than 20K binding affinity measurements) leads to models failing to generalize to new targets, and model performance is typically on par with those trained with only ligand information. The CrossDocked dataset expands binding pose data for protein-ligand complexes but does not introduce new affinity data. ChEMBL, on the other hand, contains a wealth of binding affinity information but contains no information about the binding poses. We introduce BigBind, a dataset that maps ChEMBL activity data to protein targets from CrossDocked. This dataset comprises 851K ligand binding affinities and 3D pocket structures. After augmenting this dataset with an equal number of putative inactives for each target, we train BANANA (BAsic NeurAl Network for binding Affinity) to classify actives from inactives. The resulting model achieved an AUC of 0.72 on BigBind’s test set, while a ligand-only model achieved an AUC of 0.64. Our model achieves competitive performance on the LIT-PCBA benchmark (median EF1\% 2.06) while running 16,000 times faster than molecular docking with GNINA. Notably, we achieve a state-of-the-art EF1\% of 4.95 when we use BANANA to filter out 90\% of the compounds prior to docking with GNINA. We hope that BANANA and future models trained on this dataset will prove useful for prospective virtual screening tasks.},

Existing methods usually use unrealistic data sets with hidden bias, which will limit the accuracy of virtual screening methods. Meanwhile, most DPI prediction methods pay more attention to molecular representation but lack eﬀective research on protein representation and high-level associations between diﬀerent instances. To this end, we present the novel structure-aware multimodal deep DPI prediction model, STAMP-DPI, which was trained on a curated industry-scale benchmark data set. We built a high-quality benchmark data set named GalaxyDB for DPI prediction. This industry-scale data set along with an unbiased training procedure resulted in a more robust benchmark study. For informative protein representation, we constructed a structure-aware graph neural network method from the protein sequence by combining predicted contact maps and graph neural networks. Through further integration of structure-based representation and high-level pretrained embeddings for molecules and proteins, our model eﬀectively captures the feature representation of the interactions between them. As a result, STAMP-DPI outperformed state-of-the-art DPI prediction methods by decreasing 7.00\% mean square error (MSE) in the Davis data set and improving 8.89\% area under the curve (AUC) in the GalaxyDB data set. Moreover, our model is an interpretable model with the transformer-based interaction mechanism, which can accurately reveal the binding sites between molecules and proteins.},

	abstract = {DNA-Encoded Library (DEL) technology has enabled significant advances in hit identification by enabling efficient testing of combinatorially-generated molecular libraries. DEL screens measure protein binding affinity though sequencing reads of molecules tagged with unique DNA-barcodes that survive a series of selection experiments. Computational models have been deployed to learn the latent binding affinities that are correlated to the sequenced count data; however, this correlation is often obfuscated by various sources of noise introduced in its complicated data-generation process. In order to denoise DEL count data and screen for molecules with good binding affinity, computational models require the correct assumptions in their modeling structure to capture the correct signals underlying the data. Recent advances in DEL models have focused on probabilistic formulations of count data, but existing approaches have thus far been limited to only utilizing 2-D molecule-level representations. We introduce a new paradigm, DEL-Dock, that combines ligand-based descriptors with 3-D spatial information from docked protein-ligand complexes. 3-D spatial information allows our model to learn over the actual binding modality rather than using only structured-based information of the ligand. We show that our model is capable of effectively denoising DEL count data to predict molecule enrichment scores that are better correlated with experimental binding affinity measurements compared to prior works. Moreover, by learning over a collection of docked poses we demonstrate that our model, trained only on DEL data, implicitly learns to perform good docking pose selection without requiring external supervision from expensive-to-source protein crystal structures.},

	abstract = {Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is a progressive clinical syndrome, and many patients’ condition worsen over time despite treatment. Patients with more severe disease are often intolerant of available medical therapies.To evaluate the efficacy and safety of omecamtiv mecarbil for the treatment of patients with severe heart failure (HF) enrolled in the Global Approach to Lowering Adverse Cardiac Outcomes Through Improving Contractility in Heart Failure (GALACTIC-HF) randomized clinical trial.The GALACTIC-HF study was a global double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 randomized clinical trial that was conducted at multiple centers between January 2017 and August 2020. A total of 8232 patients with symptomatic HF (defined as New York Heart Association symptom class II-IV) and left ventricular ejection fraction of 35\% or less were randomized to receive omecamtiv mecarbil or placebo and followed up for a median of 21.8 months (range, 15.4-28.6 months). The current post hoc analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of omecamtiv mecarbil therapy among patients classified as having severe HF compared with patients without severe HF. Severe HF was defined as the presence of all of the following criteria: New York Heart Association symptom class III to IV, left ventricular ejection fraction of 30\% or less, and hospitalization for HF within the previous 6 months.Participants were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either omecamtiv mecarbil or placebo.The primary end point was time to first HF event or cardiovascular (CV) death. Secondary end points included time to CV death and safety and tolerability.Among 8232 patients enrolled in the GALACTIC-HF clinical trial, 2258 patients (27.4\%; mean [SD] age, 64.5 [11.6] years; 1781 men [78.9\%]) met the specified criteria for severe HF. Of those, 1106 patients were randomized to the omecamtiv mecarbil group and 1152 to the placebo group. Patients with severe HF who received omecamtiv mecarbil experienced a significant treatment benefit for the primary end point (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.71-0.90), whereas patients without severe HF had no significant treatment benefit (HR, 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.91-1.08; P = .005 for interaction). For CV death, the results were similar (HR for patients with vs without severe HF: 0.88 [95\% CI, 0.75-1.03] vs 1.10 [95\% CI, 0.97-1.25]; P = .03 for interaction). Omecamtiv mecarbil therapy was well tolerated in patients with severe HF, with no significant changes in blood pressure, kidney function, or potassium level compared with placebo.In this post hoc analysis of data from the GALACTIC-HF clinical trial, omecamtiv mecarbil therapy may have provided a clinically meaningful reduction in the composite end point of time to first HF event or CV death among patients with severe HF. These data support a potential role of omecamtiv mecarbil therapy among patients for whom current treatment options are limited.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02929329},

Omecamtiv mecarbil does not change the motor mechanism nor does it influence myosin structure. Instead, omecamtiv mecarbil binds to an allosteric site that stabilizes the lever arm in a primed position resulting in accumulation of cardiac myosin in the primed state prior to onset of cardiac contraction, thus increasing the number of heads that can bind to the actin filament and undergo a powerstroke once the cardiac cycle starts. The mechanism of action of omecamtiv mecarbil also provides insights into uncovering how force is generated by molecular motors.},

	abstract = {Decreased systolic function is a central factor in the pathogenesis of heart failure, yet there are no safe medical therapies to improve cardiac function in patients. Currently available inotropes, such as dobutamine and milrinone, increase cardiac contractility at the expense of increased intracellular concentrations of calcium and cAMP, contributing to increased heart rate, hypotension, arrhythmias, and mortality. These adverse effects are inextricably linked to their inotropic mechanism of action. A new class of pharmacologic agents, cardiac myosin activators, directly targets the kinetics of the myosin head. In vitro studies have demonstrated that these agents increase the rate of effective myosin cross-bridge formation, increasing the duration and amount of myocyte contraction, and inhibit non-productive consumption of ATP, potentially improving myocyte energy utilization, with no effect on intracellular calcium or cAMP. Animal models have shown that this novel mechanism increases the systolic ejection time, resulting in improved stroke volume, fractional shortening, and hemodynamics with no effect on myocardial oxygen demand, culminating in signiﬁcant increases in cardiac efﬁciency. A ﬁrst-inhuman study in healthy volunteers with the lead cardiac myosin activator, CK-1827452, as well as preliminary results from a study in patients with stable chronic heart failure, have extended these ﬁndings to humans, demonstrating signiﬁcant increases in systolic ejection time, fractional shortening, stroke volume, and cardiac output.},

It is based on discretizations of a second-order system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which model a network of nonlinear controlled and damped oscillators, coupled via the adjacency structure of the underlying graph. The ﬂexibility of our framework permits any basic GNN layer (e.g. convolutional or attentional) as the coupling function, from which a multi-layer deep neural network is built up via the dynamics of the proposed ODEs. We relate the oversmoothing problem, commonly encountered in GNNs, to the stability of steady states of the underlying ODE and show that zero-Dirichlet energy steady states are not stable for our proposed ODEs. This demonstrates that the proposed framework mitigates the oversmoothing problem. Moreover, we prove that GraphCON mitigates the exploding and vanishing gradients problem to facilitate training of deep multi-layer GNNs. Finally, we show that our approach offers competitive performance with respect to the state-of-the-art on a variety of graphbased learning tasks.},

	abstract = {A Sheaf Neural Network (SNN) is a type of Graph Neural Network (GNN) that operates on a sheaf, an object that equips a graph with vector spaces over its nodes and edges and linear maps between these spaces. SNNs have been shown to have useful theoretical properties that help tackle issues arising from heterophily and over-smoothing. One complication intrinsic to these models is ﬁnding a good sheaf for the task to be solved. Previous works proposed two diametrically opposed approaches: manually constructing the sheaf based on domain knowledge and learning the sheaf end-to-end using gradientbased methods. However, domain knowledge is often insufﬁcient, while learning a sheaf could lead to overﬁtting and signiﬁcant computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel way of computing sheaves drawing inspiration from Riemannian geometry: we leverage the manifold assumption to compute manifold-and-graph-aware orthogonal maps, which optimally align the tangent spaces of neighbouring data points. We show that this approach achieves promising results with less computational overhead when compared to previous SNN models. Overall, this work provides an interesting connection between algebraic topology and differential geometry, and we hope that it will spark future research in this direction.},

            There is currently a lack of effective drugs to treat people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Non-structural protein 13 (NSP13) has been identified as a target for anti-virals due to its high sequence conservation and essential role in viral replication. Structural analysis reveals two “druggable” pockets on NSP13 that are among the most conserved sites in the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Here we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 solved in the APO form and in the presence of both phosphate and a non-hydrolysable ATP analog. Comparisons of these structures reveal details of conformational changes that provide insights into the helicase mechanism and possible modes of inhibition. To identify starting points for drug development we have performed a crystallographic fragment screen against NSP13. The screen reveals 65 fragment hits across 52 datasets opening the way to structure guided development of novel antiviral agents.},

A working supervisor-student relationship based on mutual respect, responsibility, and participation is essential for the success of a PhD thesis.

The appointment of a co-supervisor, besides the principal one, is strongly encouraged not only to increase the efficiency in monitoring the student progression but also to defuse interpersonal conflicts. Institutional regulations should include the duties and responsibilities of the supervisor. A contract prepared by the institution and signed by the supervisor and the student could help specify the task and may serve as a starting point. In case of a conflict, grievance mechanisms also need to be clear and explicit. Supervisors ought to assist the career development of the students and guide them to become independent researchers. Unfortunately, different surveys showed that there is widespread discontent among the students about their supervisors. Performance pressure on both students and supervisors create enormous tension. Students feel stressed about their career prospects. Institutional policies should consider these stress points to enhance the wellbeing of students as well as the faculty.},

In this secondary analysis, the outcome variables were quality of dyad time and breadth of their discussions. Protégé participants were graduate students, fellows, and junior faculty in behavioral and biomedical research and healthcare. Dyads with mentor training were more likely than those without mentor training to have discussed teaching and work–life balance. Dyads with peer mentoring were more likely than those without peer mentoring to have discussed clinical care and career plans. The combined intervention dyads were more likely than controls to perceive that the quality of their time together was good/excellent. Our study supports the value of these mentoring interventions to enhance the breadth of dyad discussions and quality of time together, both important components of a good mentoring relationship.},

To fill this gap, a 1-year study to assess similarities and differences among 101 HU and majority biomedical doctoral students was conducted to measure the extent to which 1) they report equivalent experiences of social support, science identity, and intentions to persist; 2) their experiences of social support predict intentions to persist 1 year later; and 3) science identity mediates the relationship between social support and intentions to persist in biomedical career pathways. Data were collected using online surveys. Results indicated that science identity significantly mediated the relationship between professional network support and persistence a year later for majority students. In contrast, for HU students, science identity mediated the relationship between instrumental, psychosocial, friend and family support, and persistence a year later. These study results provide evidence that reinforcing mentoring programs and support systems will be beneficial, especially for HU students.},

	abstract = {Problem: To achieve their potential in medical and biomedical careers, students (scholars) from under-resourced backgrounds must build sophisticated skills and develop confidence and professionalism. To flourish in an advanced educational system that may be unfamiliar, these scholars also need networks of mentors and role models. These challenges can affect scholars at multiple stages of their education. Intervention: To meet these challenges, we created a broad and innovative biomedical research-focused pipeline program: the Johns Hopkins Initiative for Careers in Science in Medicine (CSM Initiative). This initiative targets three levels: high school, undergraduate, and post-baccalaureate/pre-doctoral (graduate and medical). We provide training in essential academic, research, professional, and social skills to meet the unique challenges of our scholars from under-resourced backgrounds. Scholars also build relationships with mentors who provide career guidance and support. We present an overview of the training and assessment at each level of this initiative. Context: The initiative took place at an institution located in the greater Baltimore area and that is endowed with exceptional doctoral and postdoctoral trainees, staff, and faculty including clinicians, physician-scientists, and scientists who served as key role models and mentors. Our pipeline program draws from local high school students and a local and national pool of undergraduates and post-baccalaureates preparing for medical or graduate school. Impact: Our goals for the high school scholars are significant improvement in academic skills, increased confidence, and matriculation into higher education systems. Currently, at least 83\% of high school scholars have matriculated into four-year college programs and 73\% have chosen science, technology, engineering, math, and medicine (STEMM)-related majors. Among undergraduate participants, 42\% have matriculated thus far into medical or biomedical graduate programs and this number is expected to rise as more scholars graduate from college and either enter graduate training or pursue STEMM careers. Another 25\% have returned to our post-baccalaureate program. Among post-baccalaureate scholars, 71\% have now matriculated into doctoral-level graduate biomedical programs (medical or graduate school) and the remaining 29\% are pursuing careers in STEMM-related fields such as biomedical research with some still aiming at graduate-level education. Our long-term goal is to see a large majority of our scholars become successful professionals in medicine, biomedical research, allied healthcare, or other STEMM fields. Analysis of the early phases of the CSM initiative demonstrates such outcomes are attainable. Lessons Learned: This program provides experiences in which scholars develop and practice core competencies essential for developing their self-identity as scientists and professionals. The most important lesson learned is that mentorship teams must be highly dynamic, flexible, thoughtful, and personal in responding to the wide range of challenges and obstacles that scholars from under-resourced backgrounds must overcome to achieve career success.},

As an adjunct to traditional scientific mentoring, we created a novel academic career "coaching" intervention for PhD students in the biomedical sciences.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether and how academic career coaches can provide effective career-development-related learning experiences for URM PhD students in the biomedical sciences. We focus specifically on vicarious learning experiences, where individuals learn indirectly through the experiences of others.
METHOD: The intervention is being tested as part of a longitudinal randomized control trial (RCT). Here, we describe a nested qualitative study, using a framework approach to analyze data from a total of 48 semi-structured interviews from 24 URM PhD students (2 interviews per participant, 1 at baseline, 1 at 12-month follow-up) (16 female, 8 male; 11 Black, 12 Hispanic, 1 Native-American). We explored the role of the coach as a source of vicarious learning, in relation to the students' goal of being future biomedical science faculty.
RESULTS: Coaches were resources through which most students in the study were able to learn vicariously about how to pursue, and succeed within, an academic career. Coaches were particularly useful in instances where students' research mentors are unable to provide such vicarious learning opportunities, for example because the mentor is too busy to have career-related discussions with a student, or because they have, or value, a different type of academic career to the type the student hopes to achieve.
IMPLICATIONS: Coaching can be an important way to address the lack of structured career development that students receive in their home training environment.},

	abstract = {Improvement in the proportion of underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities (URMs) in academic positions has been unsatisfactory. Although this is a complex problem, one key issue is that graduate students often rely on research mentors for career-related support, the effectiveness of which can be variable. We present results from a novel academic career “coaching” intervention, one aim of which was to provide supplementary social support for PhD students, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. Coaching was delivered both within small groups and on an individual basis, with a diverse group of coaches and students coming from many universities. Coaches were provided with additional diversity training. Ninety-six semistructured interviews with 33 URM students over 3 years were analyzed using a qualitative framework approach. For most of the URM PhD students, coaching provided social support in the form of emotional, informational, and appraisal support. Coaching groups provided a noncompetitive environment and “community of support” within which students were able to learn from one another’s experiences and discuss negative and stressful experiences related to their graduate school, lab, or career plans. This coached peer group model is capable of providing the social support that many URM students do not find at their home universities.},

In this paper, we study what normalization is effective for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). First, we adapt and evaluate the existing methods from other domains to GNNs. Faster convergence is achieved with InstanceNorm compared to BatchNorm and LayerNorm. We provide an explanation by showing that InstanceNorm serves as a preconditioner for GNNs, but such preconditioning effect is weaker with BatchNorm due to the heavy batch noise in graph datasets. Second, we show that the shift operation in InstanceNorm results in an expressiveness degradation of GNNs for highly regular graphs. We address this issue by proposing GraphNorm with a learnable shift. Empirically, GNNs with GraphNorm converge faster compared to GNNs using other normalization. GraphNorm also improves the generalization of GNNs, achieving better performance on graph classiﬁcation benchmarks.},

Therefore, it may be the case that the previously reported performance of most ligand-based methods can be explained by overfitting to benchmarks rather than good prospective accuracy.},

However, trained ML models are often treated as black boxes and are not straightforwardly interpretable. In most cases, it is unknown which features in the data are decisive and whether a model’s predictions are right for the right reason. Hence, we re-evaluated three widely used benchmark data sets in the context of ML methods and came to the conclusion that not every benchmark data set is suitable. Moreover, we demonstrate on two examples from current literature that bias is learned implicitly and unnoticed from standard benchmarks. On the basis of these results, we conclude that there is a need for eligible validation experiments and benchmark data sets suited to ML for more bias-controlled validation in ML-based SBVS. Therefore, we provide guidelines for setting up validation experiments and give a perspective on how new data sets could be generated.},

In addition, we introduced our recent algorithm to build maximum-unbiased benchmarking sets applicable to both ligand-based and structure-based VS approaches, and its implementations to three important human histone deacetylase (HDAC) isoforms, i.e. HDAC1, HDAC6 and HDAC8.

By analyzing the molecular similarities of known drugs, we show that the inductive bias of the historic drug discovery process has a very strong 2D bias. In studying the performance of ligand-based modeling methods, it is critical to account for this issue in dataset preparation, use of computational controls, and in the interpretation of results.

However, the unconstrained optimization of enrichment alone can mislead, leading to false confidence in prospective performance. This can arise by over-optimizing for enrichment against property-matched decoys, without considering the full spectrum of molecules to be found in a true large library screen. Adding decoys representing charge extrema helps mitigate over-optimizing for electrostatic interactions. Adding decoys that represent the overall characteristics of the library to be docked allows one to sample molecules not represented by ligands and property-matched decoys but that one will encounter in a prospective screen. An optimized version of the DUD-E set (DUDE-Z), as well as Extrema and sets representing broad features of the library (Goldilocks), is developed here. We also explore the variability that one can encounter in enrichment calculations and how that can temper one’s confidence in small enrichment differences.

We examined the model performance of atomic convolutional neural network (ACNN) on the PDBbind core set and achieved a Pearson R2 of 0.73 between experimental and predicted binding affinities. Strikingly, the ACNN models did not require learning the essential protein-ligand interactions in complex structures and achieved similar performance even on datasets containing only ligand structures or only protein structures, while data splitting based on similarity clustering (protein sequence or ligand scaffold) significantly reduced the model performance. We also identified the property and topology biases in the DUD-E dataset which led to the artificially increased enrichment performance of virtual screening. The property bias in DUD-E was reduced by enforcing the more stringent ligand property matching rules, while the topology bias still exists due to the use of molecular fingerprint similarity as a decoy selection criterion. Therefore, we believe that sufficiently large and unbiased datasets are desirable for training robust AI models to accurately predict protein-ligand interactions.},

Their score was calculated against all inactive and active compounds in their target class. Subsequently, the scores were used to calculate different performance metrics including enrichment factors and AUC values. We also studied the effect of data fusion on the results. To measure the performance of the pharmacophore tools, a set of active molecules was picked either random- or chemical diversity-based from each target class to build a pharmacophore model which was then used to screen the remaining compounds in the set. Our results indicate that template sets selected by their chemical diversity are the best choice for similarity search tools, whereas the optimal training sets for pharmacophore elucidators are based on random selection underscoring that pharmacophore modeling cannot be easily automated. We also suggest a number of improvements for future benchmark sets and discuss activity cliffs as a potential problem in ligand-based virtual screening.},

However, the dearth of reliable protein-ligand x-ray structures and binding affinity data has required the use of constructed datasets for the training and evaluation of CNN molecular recognition models. Here, we outline various sources of bias in one such widely-used dataset, the Directory of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD-E). We have constructed and performed tests to investigate whether CNN models developed using DUD-E are properly learning the underlying physics of molecular recognition, as intended, or are instead learning biases inherent in the dataset itself. We find that superior enrichment efficiency in CNN models can be attributed to the analogue and decoy bias hidden in the DUD-E dataset rather than successful generalization of the pattern of protein-ligand interactions. Comparing additional deep learning models trained on PDBbind datasets, we found that their enrichment performances using DUD-E are not superior to the performance of the docking program AutoDock Vina. Together, these results suggest that biases that could be present in constructed datasets should be thoroughly evaluated before applying them to machine learning based methodology development.},

We report geometries minimal in energy, corresponding harmonic frequencies, dipole moments, polarizabilities, along with energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization. All properties were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of quantum chemistry. Furthermore, for the predominant stoichiometry, C7H10O2, there are 6,095 constitutional isomers among the 134k molecules. We report energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization at the more accurate G4MP2 level of theory for all of them. As such, this data set provides quantum chemical properties for a relevant, consistent, and comprehensive chemical space of small organic molecules. This database may serve the benchmarking of existing methods, development of new methods, such as hybrid quantum mechanics/machine learning, and systematic identification of structure-property relationships.},

	abstract = {Deep generative models have been praised for their ability to learn smooth latent representation of images, text, and audio, which can then be used to generate new, plausible data. However, current generative models are unable to work with molecular graphs due to their unique characteristics-their underlying structure is not Euclidean or grid-like, they remain isomorphic under permutation of the nodes labels, and they come with a different number of nodes and edges. In this paper, we first propose a novel variational autoencoder for molecular graphs, whose encoder and decoder are specially designed to account for the above properties by means of several technical innovations. Moreover, in contrast with the state of the art, our decoder is able to provide the spatial coordinates of the atoms of the molecules it generates. Then, we develop a gradient-based algorithm to optimize the decoder of our model so that it learns to generate molecules that maximize the value of certain property of interest and, given a molecule of interest, it is able to optimize the spatial configuration of its atoms for greater stability. Experiments reveal that our variational autoencoder can discover plausible, diverse and novel molecules more effectively than several state of the art models. Moreover, for several properties of interest, our optimized decoder is able to identify molecules with property values 121\% higher than those identified by several state of the art methods based on Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning},

This approach allows us to incrementally expand molecules while maintaining chemical validity at every step. We evaluate our model on multiple tasks ranging from molecular generation to optimization.

These models enable extensive explorations of the chemical space and provide a platform for molecular optimization. However, the vast majority of current methods does not leverage the structure of the binding target, which potentiates the binding of small molecules and plays a key role in the interaction. We propose an optimization pipeline that leverages complementary structure-based and ligand-based methods. Instead of performing docking on a ﬁxed chemical library, we iteratively select promising compounds in the full chemical space using a ligand-centered generative model. Molecular docking is then used as an oracle to guide compound optimization. This allows for iterative generation of compounds that ﬁt the target structure better and better, without prior knowledge about bioactives. For this purpose, we introduce a new graph to Selﬁes Variational Autoencoder (VAE) which beneﬁts from an 18-fold faster decoding than the graph to graph state of the art, while achieving a similar performance. We then successfully optimize the generation of molecules toward high docking scores, enabling a 10-fold enrichment of high-scoring compounds found with a ﬁxed computational cost.},

	abstract = {With the goal of being the first civilian university to reach space, The Stanford Student Space Initiative's Spaceshot Team (SSI Spaceshot) has designed a custom rocket-balloon (rockoon) system to achieve an apogee height of greater than 100 km (i.e. to cross the Kármán Line, a widely-accepted definition of the boundary of space), while demonstrating a cheap, low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), suborbital launch technology. Suborbital launch represents a high-potential space for growth in aerospace as it provides a high-value market for aerospace research and a low-cost, lower-risk opportunity for agents with less capital to access space. Technologies such as this open-source rocket-balloon system provide an incredible opportunity to democratize space and provide access to aerospace to all. Leveraging the experience of an international-award-winning rockets team, a world-record-breaking high-altitude balloon team, and members who have built satellites, high-voltage DNA synthesizers, and more, SSI is building an integrated rocket-balloon system. The system consists of a zero-pressure balloon platform which will carry a 20 kg rocket with a commercial-off-the-shelf motor to 27 km. At that height, the rocket will launch to reach a final expected apogee of 125 km. Although the underlying architecture has been verified and tested for decades, from NASA to modern space startups, SSI's design is heavily optimized to be low SWaP, affordable, and accessible as an open-source platform. In the process of creating an efficient, effective design in this problem space, SSI has created custom composites designed for the hypersonic thermal load, designed robust payload bays to survive high-shock, and investigated different stability methods for high-altitude, low-atmospheric-density launches. This project hopes to advance the emerging field of accessible aerospace by publishing our simple and achievable design for suborbital launch technology.},

Existing generative models mostly use a string- or graph-based representation, but the precise three-dimensional coordinates of the atoms are usually not encoded. First attempts in this direction have been proposed, where autoregressive or GAN-based models generate atom coordinates. Those either lack a latent space in the autoregressive setting, such that a smooth exploration of the compound space is not possible, or cannot generalize to varying chemical compositions. We propose a new approach to efficiently generate molecular structures that are not restricted to a fixed size or composition. Our model is based on the variational autoencoder which learns a translation-, rotation-, and permutation-invariant low-dimensional representation of molecules. Our experiments yield a mean reconstruction error below 0.05 Angstrom, outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods by a factor of four, and which is even lower than the spatial quantization error of most chemical descriptors.

However, a direct 3D representation of a molecule with atoms localized at voxels is too sparse, which leads to poor performance of the CNNs. In this work, we present a novel approach where atoms are extended to fill other nearby voxels with a transformation based on the wave transform. Experimenting on 4.5 million molecules from the Zinc database, we show that our proposed representation leads to better performance of CNN-based autoencoders than either the voxel-based representation or the previously used Gaussian blur of atoms and then successfully apply the new representation to classification tasks such as MACCS fingerprint prediction.},

The results for the standard PDBbind (v.2016) core test-set are state-of-the-art with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.82 and a RMSE of 1.27 in pK units between experimental and predicted affinity, but accuracy is still very sensitive to the specific protein used. KDEEP is made available via PlayMolecule.org for users to test easily their own protein–ligand complexes, with each prediction taking a fraction of a second.

	abstract = {Empirical scoring functions based on either molecular force fields or cheminformatics descriptors are widely used, in conjunction with molecular docking, during the early stages of drug discovery to predict potency and binding affinity of a drug-like molecule to a given target. These models require expert-level knowledge of physical chemistry and biology to be encoded as hand-tuned parameters or features rather than allowing the underlying model to select features in a data-driven procedure. Here, we develop a general 3-dimensional spatial convolution operation for learning atomic-level chemical interactions directly from atomic coordinates and demonstrate its application to structure-based bioactivity prediction. The atomic convolutional neural network is trained to predict the experimentally determined binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex by direct calculation of the energy associated with the complex, protein, and ligand given the crystal structure of the binding pose. Non-covalent interactions present in the complex that are absent in the protein-ligand sub-structures are identified and the model learns the interaction strength associated with these features. We test our model by predicting the binding free energy of a subset of protein-ligand complexes found in the PDBBind dataset and compare with state-of-the-art cheminformatics and machine learning-based approaches. We find that all methods achieve experimental accuracy and that atomic convolutional networks either outperform or perform competitively with the cheminformatics based methods. Unlike all previous protein-ligand prediction systems, atomic convolutional networks are end-to-end and fully-differentiable. They represent a new data-driven, physics-based deep learning model paradigm that offers a strong foundation for future improvements in structure-based bioactivity prediction.},

Our method adapts generative adversarial networks (GANs) to operate directly on graph-structured data. We combine our approach with a reinforcement learning objective to encourage the generation of molecules with specific desired chemical properties. In experiments on the QM9 chemical database, we demonstrate that our model is capable of generating close to 100\% valid compounds.

We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter).

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the 3-D structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence, the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8, has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even where no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experiment in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

As a result, generative and evolutionary inverse designs from the field of artificial intelligence have emerged at a rapid pace, with aims to optimize molecules for a particular chemical property. These models 'indirectly' explore the chemical space; by learning latent spaces, policies, distributions or by applying mutations on populations of molecules. However, the recent development of the SELFIES string representation of molecules, a surjective alternative to SMILES, have made possible other potential techniques. Based on SELFIES, we therefore propose PASITHEA, a direct gradient-based molecule optimization that applies inceptionism techniques from computer vision. PASITHEA exploits the use of gradients by directly reversing the learning process of a neural network, which is trained to predict real-valued chemical properties. Effectively, this forms an inverse regression model, which is capable of generating molecular variants optimized for a certain property. Although our results are preliminary, we observe a shift in distribution of a chosen property during inverse-training, a clear indication of PASITHEA's viability. A striking property of inceptionism is that we can directly probe the model's understanding of the chemical space it was trained on. We expect that extending PASITHEA to larger datasets, molecules and more complex properties will lead to advances in the design of new functional molecules as well as the interpretation and explanation of machine learning models.},

In this paper, we propose MoFlow, a flow-based graph generative model to learn invertible mappings between molecular graphs and their latent representations. To generate molecular graphs, our MoFlow first generates bonds (edges) through a Glow based model, then generates atoms (nodes) given bonds by a novel graph conditional flow, and finally assembles them into a chemically valid molecular graph with a posthoc validity correction. Our MoFlow has merits including exact and tractable likelihood training, efficient one-pass embedding and generation, chemical validity guarantees, 100{\textbackslash}\% reconstruction of training data, and good generalization ability. We validate our model by four tasks: molecular graph generation and reconstruction, visualization of the continuous latent space, property optimization, and constrained property optimization. Our MoFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, which implies its potential efficiency and effectiveness to explore large chemical space for drug discovery.},

We propose a reinforcement learning approach for generating molecules in cartesian coordinates allowing for quantum chemical prediction of the stability. To improve sample-efficiency we learn basic chemical rules from imitation learning on the GDB-11 database to create an initial model applicable for all stoichiometries. We then deploy multiple copies of the model conditioned on a specific stoichiometry in a reinforcement learning setting.

Our reward function is directly based on fundamental physical properties such as the energy, which we approximate via fast quantum-chemical methods. To enable progress towards de-novo molecular design, we introduce MOLGYM, an RL environment comprising several challenging molecular design tasks along with baselines. In our experiments, we show that our agent can efﬁciently learn to solve these tasks from scratch by working in a translation and rotation invariant state-action space.},

            Rational compound design remains a challenging problem for both computational methods and medicinal chemists. Computational generative methods have begun to show promising results for the design problem. However, they have not yet used the power of 3D structural information. We have developed a novel graph-based deep generative model that combines state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with structural knowledge. Our method (“DeLinker”) takes two fragments or partial structures and designs a molecule incorporating both. The generation process is protein context dependent, utilising the relative distance and orientation between the partial structures. This 3D information is vital to successful compound design, and we demonstrate its impact on the generation process and the limitations of omitting such information. In a large scale evaluation, DeLinker designed 60\% more molecules with high 3D similarity to the original molecule than a database baseline. When considering the more relevant problem of longer linkers with at least five atoms, the outperformance increased to 200\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of this approach on a diverse range of design problems: fragment linking, scaffold hopping, and proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) design. As far as we are aware, this is the first molecular generative model to incorporate 3D structural information directly in the design process. Code is available at

	abstract = {De novo molecule design through the molecular generative model has gained increasing attention in recent years. Here, a novel generative model was proposed by integrating the three-dimensional (3D) structural information of the protein binding pocket into the conditional RNN (cRNN) model to control the generation of drug-like molecules. In this model, the composition of the protein binding pocket is effectively characterized through a coarse-grain strategy and the 3D information of the pocket can be represented by the sorted eigenvalues of the Coulomb matrix (EGCM) of the coarse-grained atoms composing the binding pocket. In current work, we used our EGCM method and a previously reported binding pocket descriptor, DeeplyTough, to train cRNN models and evaluated their performance. It has been shown that the model trained with the constraint of protein environment information has a clear tendency on generating compounds with higher similarity to the original X-ray-bound ligand than the normal RNN model and also better docking scores. Our results demonstrate the potential application of the controlled generative model for the targeted molecule generation and guided exploration on the drug-like chemical space.},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks comprise a subclass of deep neural networks (DNN) with a constrained architecture that leverages the spatial and temporal structure of the domain they model. Convolutional networks achieve the best predictive performance in areas such as speech and image recognition by hierarchically composing simple local features into complex models. Although DNNs have been used in drug discovery for QSAR and ligand-based bioactivity predictions, none of these models have benefited from this powerful convolutional architecture. This paper introduces AtomNet, the first structure-based, deep convolutional neural network designed to predict the bioactivity of small molecules for drug discovery applications. We demonstrate how to apply the convolutional concepts of feature locality and hierarchical composition to the modeling of bioactivity and chemical interactions. In further contrast to existing DNN techniques, we show that AtomNet's application of local convolutional filters to structural target information successfully predicts new active molecules for targets with no previously known modulators. Finally, we show that AtomNet outperforms previous docking approaches on a diverse set of benchmarks by a large margin, achieving an AUC greater than 0.9 on 57.8\% of the targets in the DUDE benchmark.},

We describe convolutional neural network (CNN) scoring functions that take as input a comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) representation of a protein–ligand interaction. A CNN scoring function automatically learns the key features of protein–ligand interactions that correlate with binding. We train and optimize our CNN scoring functions to discriminate between correct and incorrect binding poses and known binders and nonbinders.

It basically uses latent variables like VAE, but the distribution of the latent variables is obtained by adversarial training like in GAN. The latter is intended to avoid both inappropriate approximation of posterior distribution in VAE and diﬃculty in handling discrete variables in GAN. Our benchmark study showed that ARAE indeed outperformed conventional models in terms of validity, uniqueness, and novelty per generated molecule. We also demonstrated successful conditional generation of drug-like molecules with ARAE for both cases of single and multiple properties control. As a potential realworld application, we could generate EGFR inhibitors sharing the scaﬀolds of known active molecules while satisfying drug-like conditions simultaneously.},

On the basis of deep and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, ReLeaSE integrates two deep neural networks—generative and predictive—that are trained separately but are used jointly to generate novel targeted chemical libraries. ReLeaSE uses simple representation of molecules by their simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings only. Generative models are trained with a stack-augmented memory network to produce chemically feasible SMILES strings, and predictive models are derived to forecast the desired properties of the de novo–generated compounds. In the first phase of the method, generative and predictive models are trained separately with a supervised learning algorithm. In the second phase, both models are trained jointly with the RL approach to bias the generation of new chemical structures toward those with the desired physical and/or biological properties. In the proof-of-concept study, we have used the ReLeaSE method to design chemical libraries with a bias toward structural complexity or toward compounds with maximal, minimal, or specific range of physical properties, such as melting point or hydrophobicity, or toward compounds with inhibitory activity against Janus protein kinase 2. The approach proposed herein can find a general use for generating targeted chemical libraries of novel compounds optimized for either a single desired property or multiple properties.

In this work we describe for the first time a deep generative model that can generate 3D molecular structures conditioned on a three-dimensional (3D) binding pocket. Using convolutional neural networks, we encode atomic density grids into separate receptor and ligand latent spaces. The ligand latent space is variational to support sampling of new molecules. A decoder network generates atomic densities of novel ligands conditioned on the receptor. Discrete atoms are then fit to these continuous densities to create molecular structures. We show that valid and unique molecules can be readily sampled from the variational latent space defined by a reference `seed' structure and generated structures have reasonable interactions with the binding site. As structures are sampled farther in latent space from the seed structure, the novelty of the generated structures increases, but the predicted binding affinity decreases. Overall, we demonstrate the feasibility of conditional 3D molecular structure generation and provide a starting point for methods that also explicitly optimize for desired molecular properties, such as high binding affinity.},

A variety of models have been developed to generate topological structures of drug-like molecules, but explorations in generating three-dimensional structures are still limited. Existing methods have either focused on low molecular weight compounds without considering drug-likeness or generate 3D structures indirectly using atom density maps. In this work, we introduce Ligand Neural Network (L-Net), a novel graph generative model for designing drug-like molecules with high-quality 3D structures. L-Net directly outputs the topological and 3D structure of molecules (including hydrogen atoms), without the need for additional atom placement or bond order inference algorithm. The architecture of L-Net is specifically optimized for drug-like molecules, and a set of metrics is assembled to comprehensively evaluate its performance. The results show that L-Net is capable of generating chemically correct, conformationally valid, and highly druglike molecules. Finally, to demonstrate its potential in structure-based molecular design, we combine L-Net with MCTS and test its ability to generate potential inhibitors targeting ABL1 kinase.},

However, it has proved challenging to control the design process or incorporate prior knowledge, limiting their practical use in drug discovery. In particular, generative methods have made limited use of three-dimensional (3D) structural information even though this is critical to binding. This work describes a method to incorporate such information and demonstrates the benefit of doing so. We combine an existing graph-based deep generative model, DeLinker, with a convolutional neural network to utilise physically-meaningful 3D representations of molecules and target pharmacophores. We apply our model, DEVELOP, to both linker and R-group design, demonstrating its suitability for both hit-to-lead and lead optimisation. The 3D pharmacophoric information results in improved generation and allows greater control of the design process. In multiple large-scale evaluations, we show that including 3D pharmacophoric constraints results in substantial improvements in the quality of generated molecules. On a challenging test set derived from PDBbind, our model improves the proportion of generated molecules with high 3D similarity to the original molecule by over 300\%. In addition, DEVELOP recovers 10 × more of the original molecules compared to the base-line DeLinker method.
