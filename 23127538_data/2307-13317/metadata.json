  "abstract": "In this paper, generalized Pell graphs $Π_{n,k}$, $k\\ge 2$, are introduced. The special case of $k=2$ are the Pell graphs $Π_{n}$ defined earlier by Munarini. Several metric, enumerative, and structural properties of these graphs are established. The generating function of the number of edges of $Π_{n,k}$ and the generating function of its cube polynomial are determined. The center of $Π_{n,k}$ is explicitly described; if $k$ is even, then it induces the Fibonacci cube $Γ_{n}$. It is also shown that $Π_{n,k}$ is a median graph, and that $Π_{n,k}$ embeds into a Fibonacci cube.",
