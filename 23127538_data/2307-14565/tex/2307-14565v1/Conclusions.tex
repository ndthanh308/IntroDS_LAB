\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We study a new problem of synthesizing transformations to relationalize tables. By leveraging visual characteristics of input tables using compute-vision-inspired algorithms, we obviate the need for users to provide input/output examples, which is a substantial departure from prior work. 
Future directions include extending the functionality to a broader set of operators, and exploring the applicability of this technique on other classes of transformations.
