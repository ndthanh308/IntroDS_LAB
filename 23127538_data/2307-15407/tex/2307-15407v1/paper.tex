\begin{abstract}

Recent theoretical and experimental research suggests that $\theta$-TaN is a semimetal with high thermal conductivity ($\kappa$), primarily due to the contribution of phonons ($\kappa_\texttt{ph}$). By using first-principles calculations, we show a non-monotonic pressure-dependence of the $\kappa$ of $\theta$-TaN. $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ first increases until it reaches a maximum at around 60~GPa, and then decreases. This anomalous behaviour is a consequence of the competing pressure responses of phonon-phonon and phonon-electron interactions, in contrast to the other known materials BAs and BP, where the non-monotonic pressure dependence is caused by the interplay between different phonon-phonon scattering channels. Although TaN has similar phonon dispersion features to BAs at ambient pressure, its response to pressure is different and an overall stiffening of the phonon branches takes place. Consequently, the relevant phonon-phonon scattering weakens as pressure increases. However, the increased electronic density of states around the Fermi level significantly enhances phonon-electron scattering at high pressures, driving a decrease in $\kappa_{\mathrm{ph}}$. At intermediate pressures ($\sim$~20$-$70~GPa), the $\kappa$ of TaN surpasses that of BAs. Our work provides deeper insight into phonon transport in semimetals and metals where phonon-electron scattering is relevant.

%========================= Introduction ==================================

Pressure response of materials is critical to understanding their properties and performance in many areas, including condensed-matter physics, materials science, and geophysics~\cite{Zhang_NRM17,Miao_NRC20,Knudson_SC15,Fratanduono_SC21,Pozzo_N12,Konopkova_N16,Zhou_NRP22}. Among many properties, the thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) of a material is a fundamental transport parameter for heat conduction. $\kappa$ is limited by resistive scattering between intrinsic carriers such as phonons and electrons~\cite{Ziman_book01}. Modulation of $\kappa$ with pressure and temperature over a wide range can help in understanding heat conduction in Earth's interior~\cite{Pozzo_N12,Konopkova_N16} and developing to control thermal management in microelectronic devices~\cite{Ball_NN12,Garimella_IEEE12,Waldrop_NN16}.


Under hydrostatic pressure, a crystal’s volume decreases, generally resulting in a hardening of the phonon modes. This typically leads to an increase in lattice $\kappa$ unless a structural phase transition occurs~\cite{Bridgman_RMP35,Ziman_book01}. This intuition is supported by various model calculations, although those have also shown that a large mass ratio can reverse the trend~\cite{Lindsay_PRB15}. In fact, a recent ab-initio study has revealed a non-monotonic pressure dependence of $\kappa$ for BAs, BSb and BP, with BAs and BSb share a similar microscopic origin underlying this behavior, which differs from that of BP~\cite{Ravichandran_NC19,Ravichandran_NC21}. Experimental observations for BAs also support this finding~\cite{Li_N22}.

In our previous work, we predicted that TaN has an ultrahigh thermal conductivity despite being a metallic compound. This was found to be primarily due to the dominance of phonons, as well as to its unique combination of phononic, electronic, and nuclear properties~\cite{Kundu_PRL21}. Among the transition-metal carbides and nitrides, TaN was found to be the only compound with such high $\kappa$. Our research also revealed that the mechanism responsible for TaN's ultrahigh $\kappa$ is similar to that of BAs~\cite{Feng_PRB17}, with an additional factor of weak phonon-electron scattering. Recent experiments have shown that with increasing grain size and decreasing defect concentration of the sample, the predicted high value of $\kappa$ for TaN at ambient pressure can be achieved.

In this study, we investigate the impact of pressure on $\kappa$ in TaN using first-principles calculations. Our findings reveal a non-monotonic pressure dependence of $\kappa$ due to competing responses of phonon-phonon and phonon-electron interactions. However, the hardening of all phonon modes and the decrease in phonon scattering strength with increased pressure indicates that the non-monotonic behavior arises from strong phonon-electron scattering at higher pressure, which is influenced by the increased electronic density of states around the Fermi energy.  Thus our work provides a new perspective on the non-monotonic pressure dependence of $\kappa$ in TaN.



\textbf{\textit{Methodology.---}} In the framework of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), the lattice thermal conductivity tensor ($\kappa_\texttt{ph}^{\alpha \beta}$) is expressed as~\cite{ShengBTE}

\begin{equation}
    \kappa_\texttt{ph}^{\alpha \beta} = \frac{1}{8\pi^3}\int\limits_{\mathrm{BZ}} \sum\limits_p C_V\left(p\vec{q}\right)v^\alpha_{p\vec{q}} F^\beta_{p\vec{q}}d^3\vec{q},
    \label{eq:sigma}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $p$ runs over all phonon branches, BZ denotes the Brillouin zone of the crystal, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are Cartesian axes, and $\omega_{p\vec{q}}$, $C_V\left(p\vec{q}\right)$, $v^\alpha_{p\vec{q}}$,  and $F^\beta_{p\vec{q}}$ are the angular frequency, mode heat capacity at constant volume, group velocity and mean free displacement, respectively, of phonons from branch $p$ with wave vector $\vec{q}$.

Phonon scattering is the main ingredient for determining $\kappa_\textbf{ph}$. They enter the expression above through $F^\beta_{p\vec{q}}$. $F^\beta_{p\vec{q}}$ is determined by~\cite{ShengBTE}


\begin{equation}
    F^\beta_{p\vec{q}} = \tau_{p\vec{q}} \left(v^{\beta}_{p\vec{q}}+\Delta^{\beta}_{p\vec{q}}\right).
    \label{eq:fpq}
\end{equation}

\noindent Here, $\tau_{p\vec{q}}$ is the phonon lifetime and $\Delta^{\beta}_{p\vec{q}}$ depends linearly on $F^\beta_{p\vec{q}}$ and describes the deviation from the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). We obtain $F^\beta_{p\vec{q}}$ iteratively starting from the RTA~\cite{ShengBTE,Li_PRB15}.

The inverse of $\tau_{p\vec{q}}$ is the scattering rate and is expressed as a sum of the contributions from the different scattering mechanisms. We include all the essential scattering mechanisms to calculate the thermal conductivity. Specifically, we take three-phonon (3ph), four-phonon (4ph), phonon-isotope (ph-iso), and phonon-electron (ph-el) scattering into account in our calculations.
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\tau_{p\vec{q}}} = \frac{1}{\tau^{\mathrm{3ph}}_{p\vec{q}}} + \frac{1}{\tau^{\mathrm{4ph}}_{p\vec{q}}} + \frac{1}{\tau^{\mathrm{ph\mbox{-}iso}}_{p\vec{q}}} + \frac{1}{\tau^{\mathrm{ph\mbox{-}el}}_{p\vec{q}}}.
    \label{eq:scattering}
\end{equation}
\noindent   Phonon-electron scattering involves only one phonon and does not affect $\Delta^{\beta}_{p\vec{q}}$~\cite{Chen_PRB19}. Furthermore, four-phonon scattering is dominated by Umklapp processes\cite{Feng_PRB17,Yang_PRB19} and their contribution to $\Delta^{\beta}_{p\vec{q}}$ can be neglected. The detailed expressions for $\Delta_{p\vec{q}}$, $1/\tau^{\mathrm{ph\mbox{-}iso}}_{p\vec{q}}$, $1/\tau^{\mathrm{3ph}}_{p\vec{q}}$, $1/\tau^{\mathrm{4ph}}_{p\vec{q}}$, $1/\tau^{\mathrm{ph\mbox{-}el}}_{p\vec{q}}$ can be found in Refs.~\citenum{Ward_PRB09,ShengBTE,Li_PRB15,Liao_PRL15,Chen_PRB19,Feng_PRB16,Feng_PRB17}. 

To solve the phonon BTE, we need harmonic (second-order) and anharmonic (third- and fourth-order) interatomic force constants (IFCs), which are extracted from density-functional-theory calculations carried out using the projector-augmented plane wave method~\cite{PAW94} as implemented in VASP~\cite{VASP196,VASP299}. For the calculation of phonon-electron scattering, we used the EPW software~\cite{EPW_16}, based on maximally localized Wannier functions, along with the \textsc{quantum espresso} package~\cite{QM_09}. We used the FourPhonon package~\cite{FourPhonon} to compute the four-phonon scattering rates. Finally, we used a modified ShengBTE package~\cite{ShengBTE} for calculating $\kappa_\textbf{ph}$ after including phonon-electron and four-phonon scattering rates. Further computational details, including our approach to calculating the electronic contribution to thermal transport, are given in the Supplemental Material.

Figure~\ref{fig1} shows the calculated pressure dependence of the total thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) of TaN compared to diamond~\cite{Broido_PRB12}, BAs~\cite{Ravichandran_NC19,Li_N22}, c-BN~\cite{Ravichandran_NC19}, BP~\cite{Ravichandran_NC21}, and Al~\cite{Giri_JPCL22}, which have been reported in the literature. At ambient pressure, the room-temperature total $\kappa$ of TaN is 1062 and 846 $\mathrm{W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}}$ along the a and c axes, respectively, consistent with the values reported earlier~\cite{Kundu_PRL21,Lee_AFM23}. The electronic contributions to the thermal conductivity ($\kappa_\texttt{el}$) at ambient pressure are 24 and 14 $\mathrm{W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}}$, respectively. They remain negligible at high pressures (see Supplemental Material). Interestingly, a non-monotonic behavior revealed originally in BAs and BP also occurs in TaN. Above 20~GPa, TaN overtakes BAs as the bulk material with the second largest $\kappa$. In contrast, $\kappa$ increases monotonically in diamond, c-BN, and Al. $\kappa$ is dominated almost exclusively by the electronic contribution in metals. The increase of $\kappa$ in Al is mainly attributed to the decrease of phonon-electron coupling. In usual cases like diamond and c-BN, the phonon branches stiffen, and the three-phonon scattering weakens under pressure. A monotonic increase in $\kappa$ with pressure follows. In BP, a gap between acoustic and optical modes ($a$-$o$ gap) is present in the phonon dispersion at ambient pressure. The widening of the $a$-$o$ gap decreases the scattering involving two acoustic and one optical phonon ($aao$), driving $\kappa$ to increase at low pressure. In BAs, the $a$-$o$ gap is so large that $aoo$ scattering is irrelevant. However, four-phonon scattering plays an important role in $\kappa$. $\kappa$ increases with increasing pressures in the low-pressure regime because of the progressive weakening of four-phonon scattering.
In both BP and BAs, the reduced bunching in the phonon dispersion with increasing pressure, leading to enhanced scattering among three acoustic phonons ($aaa$ processes), is the origin of the decreasing $\kappa$ at high pressure.

TaN has a phonon dispersion similar to BAs as regards the presence of a large $a$-$o$ gap and the bunching of acoustic phonons, a key characteristic leading to high $\kappa$ in TaN and BAs~\cite{Kundu_PRL21}. To see whether the mechanism underlying the non-monotonic change of $\kappa$ in TaN is the same as in BAs, we show the pressure-dependent $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ calculated by considering only specific combinations of phonon scattering mechanisms for two different temperatures, 300 and 800~K, in Fig.~\ref{fig2} (a). Surprisingly, when only considering three phonon scattering, $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ constantly increases with pressure in TaN, in contrast to BAs. Similar to BAs, the four-phonon scattering plays a vital role in determining $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ in TaN. At ambient pressure, $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ is reduced by 48\% after including four-phonon scattering on top of the three-phonon scattering. Although four-phonon scattering has a reduced effect on $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ at higher pressures, it can still lead to a 27\% reduction in $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ at 80~GPa as compared to the case with three-phonon scattering only. By comparison, in BAs the effect of four-phonon scattering is weak at higher pressure such as 17\% at 51~GPa. When further including phonon-electron scattering, $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ is almost unaffected until 60~GPa. Above 60~GPa, $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ can be significantly reduced by phonon-electron scattering, which is so strong as to cause $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ to decrease with pressure. Therefore, the non-monotonic pressure dependence of $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ is a consequence of the interplay between the phonon-phonon and phonon-electron scattering, rather than the one between three-phonon and four-phonon scattering channels as in BAs~\cite{Ravichandran_NC19}, and the one between $aaa$ and $aao$ scattering channels as in BP~\cite{Ravichandran_NC21}. Next, we will elucidate why $\kappa_\texttt{ph}^{(3)}$ in TaN behaves differently from BAs and why phonon-electron scattering gives rise to decreasing  $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ at high pressures.

Due to a large $a$-$o$ gap combined with the small bandwidth of optical phonon frequencies, the three-phonon scattering of the heat-carrying acoustic phonons is limited by $aaa$ processes in BAs~\cite{Ravichandran_NC19}. Further, due to bunching (the proximity of acoustic phonon branches), the $aaa$ scattering rates are extremely weak, with a characteristic dip in the intermediate frequency range. With increasing pressure, the longitudinal acoustic phonons stiffen evidently while the transverse acoustic phonons change marginally. Therefore, the bunching effect is significantly reduced, increasing the scattering phase space and causing the $aaa$ scattering rates to increase fast.   


In the case of TaN, the phonon dispersion and three-phonon scattering rates for different pressures are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig3} (a) and (b), respectively. The $a$-$o$ gap is not large enough to completely suppress the $aao$ scattering at high acoustic frequencies, and the $aao$ scattering is reduced partially due to a larger $a$-$o$ gap under pressure (see Supplemental Material). The optical bandwidth even allows dominance of scattering rates by the $aoo$ processes at low frequencies, and the $aoo$ scattering is strengthened partially because of a larger optical band width under pressure (see Supplemental Material). However, the primary contribution to $\kappa_\texttt{ph}^{(3)}$ arises from acoustic phonons in an intermediate frequency range, for which scattering is almost exclusively limited by $aaa$ processes (see Supplemental Material). Under applied pressure, all acoustic phonon modes experience hardening at the same pace, as manifested by the fact that the acoustic phonon dispersions can overlap if scaled properly [Fig.~\ref{fig3} (a)](see Supplemental Material). This indicates that the bunching of acoustic modes remains nearly unchanged with increasing pressure in TaN. The difference in the response of the phonon dispersion, particularly the acoustic part to pressure, gives rise to different responses of the scattering rates to pressure. The $aaa$ scattering rate for a given $\textbf{q}$ point decreases with pressure in TaN (see Supplemental Material) compared to the increasing behavior in BAs. As a consequence, $\kappa_\texttt{ph}^{(3)}$ monotonically increases with pressure in TaN.  

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig2} (a), the four-phonon scattering plays an important role in determining $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ in TaN throughout the whole pressure range considered, and the four-phonon effect becomes weaker at higher pressure. To understand this, the four-phonon scattering rates are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig3} (b). Similarly to the three-phonon scattering, especially for the $aaa$ processes, the four-phonon scattering rates decrease with increasing pressure but more rapidly. This stronger pressure dependence of four-phonon scattering leads to a weaker effect at higher pressure. Consequently, the actual $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ has a stronger pressure dependence than it would have if only three-phonon scattering was considered. This is more apparent when plotting the pressure-dependent $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ scaled by the corresponding zero-pressure value with specific combinations of phonon scattering mechanisms considered [Fig.~\ref{fig2} (b)]. As a matter of fact, $\mathrm{d}\kappa/\mathrm{d}P$ for TaN is 17.5 and 14.4 $\mathrm{W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}\,GPa^{-1}}$ along the a and c axes, respectively, which are similar to the values of approximately 19.6, 15.4, and 12.6 $\mathrm{W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}\,GPa^{-1}}$ for diamond~\cite{Broido_PRB12}, BP~\cite{Ravichandran_NC21}, and BAs~\cite{Ravichandran_NC19}, respectively. In addition to the stronger pressure dependence, the four-phonon scattering also has a stronger $T$ dependence than the three-phonon scattering. Therefore, the actual $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ has a stronger pressure dependence at higher temperatures for BAs. In contrast, the pressure dependence of $\kappa_\texttt{ph}^{(3)}$ for TaN is almost $T$ independent [Fig.~\ref{fig2} (b)].

The fact that four-phonon scattering has a stronger pressure dependence than three-phonon scattering can be understood from the weighted phase space\cite{ShengBTE,Li_PRB14,Li_PRB14Ir}, which is extremely sensitive to changes in the phonon spectrum. For example, if the entire spectrum is scaled by a factor of $c$, then the three-phonon weighted phase space is scaled by a factor of $c^{-5}$, while the four-phonon weighted phase space can be scaled by $c^{-6}$. At 80~GPa, the acoustic phonon frequency increased by a factor of $1.22$ compared to the frequency at 0~GPa. The ratios $1.22^{5} = 2.65$ and $1.22^{6} = 3.22$ closely correspond to the obtained weighted phase space ratios of $2.5$ and $3.6$ for three-phonon and 4ph, respectively, between 0 and 80~GPa. Hence, the higher weighted phase-space ratio suggests that four-phonon scattering weakens faster than three-phonon scattering with increasing pressure.


Finally, we study the phonon-electron scattering, leading to decreasing  $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ at high pressures. At ambient pressure, phonon-electron scattering is negligible compared to anharmonic phonon-phonon scattering. This weak phonon-electron scattering is actually a key factor resulting in the high value of $\kappa$ for TaN compared to WC with the same type of crystalline structure, as established in our previous work~\cite{Kundu_MTP20,Kundu_PRL21}. Phonon-electron scattering is positively correlated with the electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level~\cite{Xu_PRL14,Wang_JAP16,Dongre_JMCA20,Kundu_MTP20}. The weak phonon-electron scattering is attributed to the direct $d-d$ bonding between Ta atoms, resulting in a semimetallic band structure and a low DOS around the Fermi energy~\cite{Wijeyesekera_IC84}. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig4} (a), the phonon-electron scattering rates can be increased by orders of magnitudes as pressure increases. Fig.~\ref{fig4} (b) illustrates that there is a simultaneous increase in the DOS at the Fermi level with increasing pressure. Consequently, the DOS around the Fermi energy gradually increases and becomes significant above 60~GPa. Therefore, the increased DOS and subsequently higher phonon-electron scattering rates are at the origin of the decrease of $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ at high pressures in TaN. 


In summary, starting from first-principles calculations, we reveal a non-monotonic pressure dependence of $\kappa$ of TaN similar to that observed in BAs and BP but due to a different mechanism. This anomalous behaviour results from the competing responses of phonon-phonon and phonon-electron scattering to pressure, in contrast to the interplay between different phonon-phonon scattering channels for BAs and BP. The overall phonon dispersion stiffens almost at the same pace, leading to continuously weakened three-acoustic-phonon and four-phonon scatterings, giving rise to an initially increasing $\kappa$. At higher pressures, the electronic density of states is increased significantly, leading to enhanced phonon-electron scattering and consequently driving $\kappa_\texttt{ph}$ to decrease. The $\kappa$ of TaN can surpass that of BAs in the range $\sim$~20$-$70~GPa. Finally, it is worth noting that TaN has been synthesized and remains stable at high pressures\cite{Feng_CPB18,Jia_CPL19,Lee_AFM23}. Our reported anomalous pressure dependence of $\kappa$ occurs at around 60~GPa, and thus within the experimentally accessible range.
