  "abstract": "The notion of support provides an analogue of Stone duality, relating lattices to topological spaces. This note aims to explain in lattice theoretic terms what has been developed in the context of triangulated categories. In particular, the parallel between support via closed and open sets is addressed in terms of Hochster duality. As an application we indicate some consequences for tensor exact categories.",
