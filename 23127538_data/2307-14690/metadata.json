  "abstract": "Not long ago, Cirici and Wilson defined a Dolbeault cohomology on almost complex manifolds to answer Hirzebruch's problem. In this paper, we define a refined Dolbeault cohomology on almost complex manifolds. We show that the condition $\\tilde h^{1,0}=\\tilde h^{0,1}$ implies a symplectic structure on a compact almost complex $4$ manifold, where $\\tilde h^{1,0}$ and $\\tilde h^{0,1}$ are the dimensions of the refined Dolbeault cohomology groups with bi-degrees $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ respectively. Combining the partial answer to Donaldson's tameness conjecture, we offer a sufficient condition for a compact almost complex $4$ manifold to become an almost Kähler one.\n  Moreover, we prove that the condition $\\tilde{h}^{1,0}=\\tilde h^{0,1}$ is equivalent to the generalized $\\partial\\bar\\partial$-lemma. This can be regarded as an analogue of the Kodaira's conjecture on almost complex $4$ manifolds. As an application, we show that the Kodaira-Thurston manifold satisfies the $\\partial\\bar\\partial$-lemma. Meanwhile, we show that the Frölicher-type equality does not hold on a general almost complex $4$ manifold, which is different to the case of compact complex surfaces.",
