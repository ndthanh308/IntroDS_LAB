  "abstract": "A technique is described in this paper to avoid order reduction when integrating reaction-diffusion initial boundary value problems with explicit exponential Rosenbrock methods. The technique is valid for any Rosenbrock method, without having to impose any stiff order conditions, and for general time-dependent boundary values. An analysis on the global error is thoroughly performed and some numerical experiments are shown which corroborate the theoretical results, and in which a big gain in efficiency with respect to applying the standard method of lines can be observed.",
