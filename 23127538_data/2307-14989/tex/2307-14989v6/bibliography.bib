abstract = {This is a partly non-technical introduction to selected topics on tensor network methods, based on several lectures and introductory seminars given on the subject. It should be a good place for newcomers to get familiarized with some of the key ideas in the field, specially regarding the numerics. After a very general introduction we motivate the concept of tensor network and provide several examples. We then move on to explain some basics about Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS). Selected details on some of the associated numerical methods for 1d and 2d quantum lattice systems are also discussed.}

abstract={Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes can achieve high encoding rates and good code distance scaling, potentially enabling low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, implementing qLDPC codes involves nonlocal operations that require long-range connectivity between qubits. This makes their physical realization challenging in comparison to geometrically local codes, such as the surface code. Here we propose a hardware-efficient scheme for fault-tolerant quantum computation with high-rate qLDPC codes that is compatible with the recently demonstrated capabilities of reconfigurable atom arrays. Our approach utilizes the product structure inherent in many qLDPC codes to implement the nonlocal syndrome extraction circuit through atom rearrangement, resulting in an effectively constant overhead. We prove the fault tolerance of these protocols, and our simulations show that the qLDPC-based architecture starts to outperform the surface code with as few as several hundred physical qubits. We further find that quantum algorithms involving thousands of logical qubits can be performed using less than 105 physical qubits. Our work suggests that low-overhead quantum computing with qLDPC codes is within reach using current experimental technologies.},

We have not yet reached the advent of useful quantum computation, but when we do, it will affect nearly all scientific disciplines. In this review, we examine how current quantum algorithms could revolutionize computational biology and bioinformatics. There are potential benefits across the entire field, from the ability to process vast amounts of information and run machine learning algorithms far more efficiently, to algorithms for quantum simulation that are poised to improve computational calculations in drug discovery, to quantum algorithms for optimization that may advance fields from protein structure prediction to network analysis. However, these exciting prospects are susceptible to “hype,” and it is also important to recognize the caveats and challenges in this new technology. Our aim is to introduce the promise and limitations of emerging quantum computing technologies in the areas of computational molecular biology and bioinformatics.

abstract={The holographic principle, theorized to be a property of quantum gravity, postulates that the description of a volume of space can be encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary. The anti-de Sitter (AdS)/conformal field theory correspondence or duality1 is the principal example of holography. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model of N{\thinspace}≫{\thinspace}1 Majorana fermions2,3 has features suggesting the existence of a gravitational dual in AdS2, and is a new realization of holography4--6. We invoke the holographic correspondence of the SYK many-body system and gravity to probe the conjectured ER=EPR relation between entanglement and spacetime geometry7,8 through the traversable wormhole mechanism as implemented in the SYK model9,10. A qubit can be used to probe the SYK traversable wormhole dynamics through the corresponding teleportation protocol9. This can be realized as a quantum circuit, equivalent to the gravitational picture in the semiclassical limit of an infinite number of qubits9. Here we use learning techniques to construct a sparsified SYK model that we experimentally realize with 164 two-qubit gates on a nine-qubit circuit and observe the corresponding traversable wormhole dynamics. Despite its approximate nature, the sparsified SYK model preserves key properties of the traversable wormhole physics: perfect size winding11--13, coupling on either side of the wormhole that is consistent with a negative energy shockwave14, a Shapiro time delay15, causal time-order of signals emerging from the wormhole, and scrambling and thermalization dynamics16,17. Our experiment was run on the Google Sycamore processor. By interrogating a two-dimensional gravity dual system, our work represents a step towards a program for studying quantum gravity in the laboratory. Future developments will require improved hardware scalability and performance as well as theoretical developments including higher-dimensional quantum gravity duals18 and other SYK-like models19.},

abstract={The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2--7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8--14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

abstract = {Quantum computational advantage or supremacy is a long-anticipated milestone toward practical quantum computers. Recent work claimed to have reached this point, but subsequent work managed to speed up the classical simulation and pointed toward a sample size–dependent loophole. Quantum computational advantage, rather than being a one-shot experimental proof, will be the result of a long-term competition between quantum devices and classical simulation. Zhong et al. sent 50 indistinguishable single-mode squeezed states into a 100-mode ultralow-loss interferometer and sampled the output using 100 high-efficiency single-photon detectors. By obtaining up to 76-photon coincidence, yielding a state space dimension of about 1030, they measured a sampling rate that is about 1014-fold faster than using state-of-the-art classical simulation strategies and supercomputers. Science, this issue p. 1460 Quantum computational advantage is demonstrated using boson sampling with photons. Quantum computers promise to perform certain tasks that are believed to be intractable to classical computers. Boson sampling is such a task and is considered a strong candidate to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage. We performed Gaussian boson sampling by sending 50 indistinguishable single-mode squeezed states into a 100-mode ultralow-loss interferometer with full connectivity and random matrix—the whole optical setup is phase-locked—and sampling the output using 100 high-efficiency single-photon detectors. The obtained samples were validated against plausible hypotheses exploiting thermal states, distinguishable photons, and uniform distribution. The photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang, generates up to 76 output photon clicks, which yields an output state-space dimension of 1030 and a sampling rate that is faster than using the state-of-the-art simulation strategy and supercomputers by a factor of ~1014.}}

abstract = {Quantum technology promises to revolutionize how we learn about the physical world. An experiment that processes quantum data with a quantum computer could have substantial advantages over conventional experiments in which quantum states are measured and outcomes are processed with a classical computer. We proved that quantum machines could learn from exponentially fewer experiments than the number required by conventional experiments. This exponential advantage is shown for predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis, and learning about physical dynamics. Furthermore, the quantum resources needed for achieving an exponential advantage are quite modest in some cases. Conducting experiments with 40 superconducting qubits and 1300 quantum gates, we demonstrated that a substantial quantum advantage is possible with today’s quantum processors. There is considerable interest in extending the recent success of quantum computers in outperforming their conventional classical counterparts (quantum advantage) from some model mathematical problems to more meaningful tasks. Huang et al. show how manipulating multiple quantum states can provide an exponential advantage over classical processing of measurements of single-quantum states for certain learning tasks. These include predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis on noisy states, and learning approximate models of physical dynamics (see the Perspective by Dunjko). In their proof-of-principle experiments using up to 40 qubits on a Google Sycamore quantum processor, the authors achieved almost four orders of magnitude of reduction in the required number of experiments over the best-known classical lower bounds. —YS Quantum-enhanced strategies can provide a dramatic performance boost in learning useful information from quantum experiments.}}

abstract={A quantum computer attains computational advantage when outperforming the best classical computers running the best-known algorithms on well-defined tasks. No photonic machine offering programmability over all its quantum gates has demonstrated quantum computational advantage: previous machines1,2 were largely restricted to static gate sequences. Earlier photonic demonstrations were also vulnerable to spoofing3, in which classical heuristics produce samples, without direct simulation, lying closer to the ideal distribution than do samples from the quantum hardware. Here we report quantum computational advantage using Borealis, a photonic processor offering dynamic programmability on all gates implemented. We carry out Gaussian boson sampling4 (GBS) on 216 squeezed modes entangled with three-dimensional connectivity5, using a time-multiplexed and photon-number-resolving architecture. On average, it would take more than 9,000{\thinspace}years for the best available algorithms and supercomputers to produce, using exact methods, a single sample from the programmed distribution, whereas Borealis requires only 36{\thinspace}$\mu$s. This runtime advantage is over 50 million times as extreme as that reported from earlier photonic machines. Ours constitutes a very large GBS experiment, registering events with up to 219 photons and a mean photon number of 125. This work is a critical milestone on the path to a practical quantum computer, validating key technological features of photonics as a platform for this goal.},

The processor monolithically integrates all the key functionalities and capabilities of initialisation, manipulation, and measurement of the two quantum quart (ququart) states and multi-value quantum-controlled logic gates with high-level fidelities. By reprogramming the configuration of the processor, we implemented the most basic quantum Fourier transform algorithms, all in quaternary, to benchmark the enhancement of quantum parallelism using qudits, which include generalised Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms, quaternary phase estimation and fast factorization algorithms. The monolithic integration and high programmability have allowed the implementations of more than one million high-fidelity preparations, operations and projections of qudit states in the processor. Our work shows an integrated photonic quantum technology for qudit-based quantum computing with enhanced capacity, accuracy, and efficiency, which could lead to the acceleration of building a large-scale quantum computer.},

A number of models of quantum computation exist. These models have been shown to be formally equivalent, but their underlying elementary concepts and the requirements for their practical realization can differ significantly. A particularly exciting paradigm is that of measurement-based quantum computation, where the processing of quantum information takes place by rounds of simple measurements on qubits prepared in a highly entangled state. We review recent developments in measurement-based quantum computation with a view to both fundamental and practical issues, in particular the power of quantum computation, the protection against noise (fault tolerance) and steps towards experimental realization.

Such quantum systems must be made from robust hardware that can coherently store, process, and extract the encoded information, as well as possess effective quantum error correction (QEC) protocols to detect and correct errors. Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) provides a promising hardware platform for implementing robust quantum devices. In particular, bosonic encodings in cQED that use multi-photon states of superconducting cavities to encode information have shown success in realizing hardware-efficient QEC.

    abstract = "{Photons have been a flagship system for studying quantum mechanics, advancing quantum information science, and developing quantum technologies. Quantum entanglement, teleportation, quantum key distribution, and early quantum computing demonstrations were pioneered in this technology because photons represent a naturally mobile and low-noise system with quantum-limited detection readily available. The quantum states of individual photons can be manipulated with very high precision using interferometry, an experimental staple that has been under continuous development since the 19th century. The complexity of photonic quantum computing devices and protocol realizations has raced ahead as both underlying technologies and theoretical schemes have continued to develop. Today, photonic quantum computing represents an exciting path to medium- and large-scale processing. It promises to put aside its reputation for requiring excessive resource overheads due to inefficient two-qubit gates. Instead, the ability to generate large numbers of photons—and the development of integrated platforms, improved sources and detectors, novel noise-tolerant theoretical approaches, and more—have solidified it as a leading contender for both quantum information processing and quantum networking. Our concise review provides a flyover of some key aspects of the field, with a focus on experiment. Apart from being a short and accessible introduction, its many references to in-depth articles and longer specialist reviews serve as a launching point for deeper study of the field.}",

Our main finding is that fluctuations in qubit relaxation are local to the qubit and are caused by instabilities of near-resonant two-level-systems (TLS). Through statistical analysis, we determine sub-millihertz switching rates of these TLS and observe the coherent coupling between an individual TLS and a transmon qubit. Finally, we find evidence that the qubit's frequency stability produces a 0.8 ms limit on the pure dephasing which we also observe. These findings raise the need for performing qubit metrology to examine the reproducibility of qubit parameters, where these fluctuations could affect qubit gate fidelity.},

abstract={The decoherence effects experienced by the qubits of a quantum processor are generally characterized using the amplitude damping time (T1) and the dephasing time (T2). Quantum channel models that exist at the time of writing assume that these parameters are fixed and invariant. However, recent experimental studies have shown that they exhibit a time-varying (TV) behaviour. These time-dependant fluctuations of T1 and T2, which become even more pronounced in the case of superconducting qubits, imply that conventional static quantum channel models do not capture the noise dynamics experienced by realistic qubits with sufficient precision. In this article, we study how the fluctuations of T1 and T2 can be included in quantum channel models. We propose the idea of time-varying quantum channel (TVQC) models, and we show how they provide a more realistic portrayal of decoherence effects than static models in some instances. We also discuss the divergence that exists between TVQCs and their static counterparts by means of a metric known as the diamond norm. In many circumstances this divergence can be significant, which indicates that the time-dependent nature of decoherence must be considered, in order to construct models that capture the real nature of quantum devices.},

abstract={Performing large calculations with a quantum computer will likely require a fault-tolerant architecture based on quantum error-correcting codes. The challenge is to design practical quantum error-correcting codes that perform well against realistic noise using modest resources. Here we show that a variant of the surface code---the XZZX code---offers remarkable performance for fault-tolerant quantum computation. The error threshold of this code matches what can be achieved with random codes (hashing) for every single-qubit Pauli noise channel; it is the first explicit code shown to have this universal property. We present numerical evidence that the threshold even exceeds this hashing bound for an experimentally relevant range of noise parameters. Focusing on the common situation where qubit dephasing is the dominant noise, we show that this code has a practical, high-performance decoder and surpasses all previously known thresholds in the realistic setting where syndrome measurements are unreliable. We go on to demonstrate the favourable sub-threshold resource scaling that can be obtained by specialising a code to exploit structure in the noise. We show that it is possible to maintain all of these advantages when we perform fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

abstract={The accumulation of physical errors1--3 prevents the execution of large-scale algorithms in current quantum computers. Quantum error correction4 promises a solution by encoding k logical qubits onto a larger number n of physical qubits, such that the physical errors are suppressed enough to allow running a desired computation with tolerable fidelity. Quantum error correction becomes practically realizable once the physical error rate is below a threshold value that depends on the choice of quantum code, syndrome measurement circuit and decoding algorithm5. We present an end-to-end quantum error correction protocol that implements fault-tolerant memory on the basis of a family of low-density parity-check codes6. Our approach achieves an error threshold of 0.7{\%} for the standard circuit-based noise model, on par with the surface code7--10 that for 20{\thinspace}years was the leading code in terms of error threshold. The syndrome measurement cycle for a length-n code in our family requires n ancillary qubits and a depth-8 circuit with CNOT gates, qubit initializations and measurements. The required qubit connectivity is a degree-6 graph composed of two edge-disjoint planar subgraphs. In particular, we show that 12 logical qubits can be preserved for nearly 1 million syndrome cycles using 288 physical qubits in total, assuming the physical error rate of 0.1{\%}, whereas the surface code would require nearly 3,000 physical qubits to achieve said performance. Our findings bring demonstrations of a low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memory within the reach of near-term quantum processors.},

abstract={Surface codes are building blocks of quantum computing platforms based on 2D arrays of qubits responsible for detecting and correcting errors. The error suppression achieved by the surface code is usually estimated by simulating toy noise models describing random Pauli errors. However, Pauli noise models fail to capture coherent processes such as systematic unitary errors caused by imperfect control pulses. Here we report the first large-scale simulation of quantum error correction protocols based on the surface code in the presence of coherent noise. We observe that the standard Pauli approximation provides an accurate estimate of the error threshold but underestimates the logical error rate in the sub-threshold regime. We find that for large code size the logical-level noise is well approximated by random Pauli errors even though the physical-level noise is coherent. Our work demonstrates that coherent effects do not significantly change the error correcting threshold of surface codes. This gives more confidence in the viability of the fault-tolerance architecture pursued by several experimental groups.},

In these codes, qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however, for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures.}",

abstract={Quantum computers hold the promise of solving computational problems that are intractable using conventional methods1. For fault-tolerant operation, quantum computers must correct errors occurring owing to unavoidable decoherence and limited control accuracy2. Here we demonstrate quantum error correction using the surface code, which is known for its exceptionally high tolerance to errors3--6. Using 17 physical qubits in a superconducting circuit, we encode quantum information in a distance-three logical qubit, building on recent distance-two error-detection experiments7--9. In an error-correction cycle taking only 1.1{\thinspace}$\mu$s, we demonstrate the preservation of four cardinal states of the logical qubit. Repeatedly executing the cycle, we measure and decode both bit-flip and phase-flip error syndromes using a minimum-weight perfect-matching algorithm in an error-model-free approach and apply corrections in post-processing. We find a low logical error probability of 3{\%} per cycle when rejecting experimental runs in which leakage is detected. The measured characteristics of our device agree well with a numerical model. Our demonstration of repeated, fast and high-performance quantum error-correction cycles, together with recent advances in ion traps10, support our understanding that fault-tolerant quantum computation will be practically realizable.},

abstract={Practical quantum computing will require error rates well below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction1,2 offers a path to algorithmically relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, for which increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across several code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find that our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, in terms of both logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle ((2.914{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.016){\%} compared to (3.028{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.023){\%}). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a 1.7{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−6 logical error per cycle floor set by a single high-energy event (1.6{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−7 excluding this event). We accurately model our experiment, extracting error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark an experimental demonstration in which quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.},

abstract={Suppressing errors is the central challenge for useful quantum computing1, requiring quantum error correction (QEC)2--6 for large-scale processing. However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected `logical' qubits, in which information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy2--4, poses substantial challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Using logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral-atom arrays7, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities8, arbitrary connectivity7,9, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout10--15. Operating this logical processor with various types of encoding, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface-code6 distance from d{\thinspace}={\thinspace}3 to d{\thinspace}={\thinspace}7, preparation of colour-code qubits with break-even fidelities5, fault-tolerant creation of logical Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 colour-code qubits. Finally, using 3D [[8,3,2]] code blocks16,17, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits18 with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity19 with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates20. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical-qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling21,22. These results herald the advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path towards large-scale logical processors.},

abstract={Quantum computation, a paradigm of computing that is completely different from classical methods, benefits from theoretically proved speed-ups for certain problems and can be used to study the properties of quantum systems1. Yet, because of the inherently fragile nature of the physical computing elements (qubits), achieving quantum advantages over classical computation requires extremely low error rates for qubit operations, as well as substantialphysical qubits, to realize fault tolerance via quantum error correction2,3. However, recent theoretical work4,5 has shown that the accuracy of computation (based on expectation values of quantum observables) can be enhanced through an extrapolation of results from a collection of experiments of varying noise. Here we demonstrate this error mitigation protocol on a superconducting quantum processor, enhancing its computational capability, with no additional hardware modifications. We apply the protocol to mitigate errors in canonical single- and two-qubit experiments and then extend its application to the variational optimization6--8 of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and magnetism9. We effectively demonstrate that the suppression of incoherent errors helps to achieve an otherwise inaccessible level of accuracy in the variational solutions using our noisy processor. These results demonstrate that error mitigation techniques will enable substantial improvements in the capabilities of near-term quantum computing hardware.},

abstract={Noise in quantum computers can result in biased estimates of physical observables. Accurate bias-free estimates can be obtained using probabilistic error cancellation, an error-mitigation technique that effectively inverts well-characterized noise channels. Learning correlated noise channels in large quantum circuits, however, has been a major challenge and has severely hampered experimental realizations. Our work presents a practical protocol for learning and inverting a sparse noise model that is able to capture correlated noise and scales to large quantum devices. These advances allow us to demonstrate probabilistic error cancellation on a superconducting quantum processor, thereby providing a way to measure noise-free observables at larger circuit volumes.},

abstract={Quantum computing promises to offer substantial speed-ups over its classical counterpart for certain problems. However, the greatest impediment to realizing its full potential is noise that is inherent to these systems. The widely accepted solution to this challenge is the implementation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits, which is out of reach for current processors. Here we report experiments on a noisy 127-qubit processor and demonstrate the measurement of accurate expectation values for circuit volumes at a scale beyond brute-force classical computation. We argue that this represents evidence for the utility of quantum computing in a pre-fault-tolerant era. These experimental results are enabled by advances in the coherence and calibration of a superconducting processor at this scale and the ability to characterize1 and controllably manipulate noise across such a large device. We establish the accuracy of the measured expectation values by comparing them with the output of exactly verifiable circuits. In the regime of strong entanglement, the quantum computer provides correct results for which leading classical approximations such as pure-state-based 1D (matrix product states, MPS) and 2D (isometric tensor network states, isoTNS) tensor network methods2,3 break down. These experiments demonstrate a foundational tool for the realization of near-term quantum applications4,5.},

In particular, efficient modern classical codes that attain the Shannon capacity can be made into entanglement-assisted quantum codes attaining the hashing bound (closely related to the quantum capacity). For systems without large amounts of shared entanglement, these codes can also be used as catalytic codes, in which a small amount of initial entanglement enables quantum communication.}}

Then, we give some insight into the quantum decoding problems to clarify that the degeneracy property is implicitly embedded in any decoding algorithm, independent of the typical definition of degenerate codes. Then, over the depolarizing channel model, we show that QMLD and QMEPD are NP-hard. The NP-hardnesses of these decoding problems indicate that decoding general stabilizer codes is extremely difficult, strengthening the foundation of quantum code-based cryptography.},

title = {Surface code quantum computing by lattice surgery},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {In recent years, surface codes have become a leading method for quantum error correction in theoretical large-scale computational and communications architecture designs. Their comparatively high fault-tolerant thresholds and their natural two-dimensional nearest-neighbour (2DNN) structure make them an obvious choice for large scale designs in experimentally realistic systems. While fundamentally based on the toric code of Kitaev, there are many variants, two of which are the planar- and defect-based codes. Planar codes require fewer qubits to implement (for the same strength of error correction), but are restricted to encoding a single qubit of information. Interactions between encoded qubits are achieved via transversal operations, thus destroying the inherent 2DNN nature of the code. In this paper we introduce a new technique enabling the coupling of two planar codes without transversal operations, maintaining the 2DNN of the encoded computer. Our lattice surgery technique comprises splitting and merging planar code surfaces, and enables us to perform universal quantum computation (including magic state injection) while removing the need for braided logic in a strictly 2DNN design, and hence reduces the overall qubit resources for logic operations. Those resources are further reduced by the use of a rotated lattice for the planar encoding. We show how lattice surgery allows us to distribute encoded GHZ states in a more direct (and overhead friendly) manner, and how a demonstration of an encoded CNOT between two distance-3 logical states is possible with 53 physical qubits, half of that required in any other known construction in 2D.}

 abstract = {The concept of multiple-particle interference is discussed, using insights provided by the classical theory of error correcting codes. This leads to a discussion of error correction in a quantum communication channel or a quantum computer. Methods of error correction in the quantum regime are presented, and their limitations assessed. A quantum channel can recover from arbitrary decoherence of x qubits if K bits of quantum information are encoded using n quantum bits, where K/n can be greater than 1 - 2H (2x/n), but must be less than 1 - 2H (x/n). This implies exponential reduction of decoherence with only a polynomial increase in the computing resources required. Therefore quantum computation can be made free of errors in the presence of physically realistic levels of decoherence. The methods also allow isolation of quantum communication from noise and evesdropping (quantum privacy amplification).},

We find that the error tolerance of the surface codes depends on the connectivity of the underlying lattices; the error chains on a lattice of lower connectivity are easier to correct. On the other hand, the loss tolerance of the surface codes exhibits an opposite behavior; the logical information on a lattice of higher connectivity has more robustness against qubit loss.

    abstract = { This paper shows that quantum computation can be made fault-tolerant against errors and inaccuracies when $\eta$, the probability for an error in a qubit or a gate, is smaller than a constant threshold $\eta_c$. This result improves on Shor's result [Proceedings of the 37th Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, IEEE, Los Alamitos, CA, 1996, pp. 56–65], which shows how to perform fault-tolerant quantum computation when the error rate $\eta$ decays polylogarithmically with the size of the computation, an assumption which is physically unreasonable. The cost of making the quantum circuit fault-tolerant in our construction is polylogarithmic in time and space. Our result holds for a very general local noise model, which includes probabilistic errors, decoherence, amplitude damping, depolarization, and systematic inaccuracies in the gates. Moreover, we allow exponentially decaying correlations between the errors both in space and in time. Fault-tolerant computation can be performed with any universal set of gates. The result also holds for quantum particles with \$p>2\$ states, namely, p-qudits, and is also generalized to one-dimensional quantum computers with only nearest-neighbor interactions. No measurements, or classical operations, are required during the quantum computation. We estimate the threshold of our construction to be $\eta_c\simeq 10^{-6}$, in the best case. By this we show that local noise is in principle not an obstacle for scalable quantum computation. The main ingredient of our proof is the computation on states encoded by a quantum error correcting code (QECC). To this end we introduce a special class of Calderbank–Shor–Steane (CSS) codes, called polynomial codes (the quantum analogue of Reed–Solomon codes). Their nice algebraic structure allows all of the encoded gates to be transversal. We also provide another version of the proof which uses more general CSS codes, but its encoded gates are slightly less elegant. To achieve fault tolerance, we encode the quantum circuit by another circuit by using one of these QECCs. This step is repeated polyloglog many times, each step slightly improving the effective error rate, to achieve the desired reliability. The resulting circuit exhibits a hierarchical structure, and for the analysis of its robustness we borrow terminology from Khalfin and Tsirelson [Found. Phys., 22 (1992), pp. 879–948] and Gács [Advances in Computing Research: A Research Annual: Randomness and Computation, JAI Press, Greenwich, CT, 1989]. The paper is to a large extent self-contained. In particular, we provide simpler proofs for many of the known results we use, such as the fact that it suffices to correct for bit-flips and phase-flips, the correctness of CSS codes, and the fact that two-qubit gates are universal, together with their extensions to higher-dimensional particles. We also provide full proofs of the universality of the sets of gates we use (the proof of universality was missing in Shor's paper). This paper thus provides a self-contained and complete proof of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation in the presence of local noise. }

The possibility of contrasting the noisy effects introduced by the channel iterations via the action of intermediate (filtering) transformations is analyzed. We provide some examples in which our functionals can be exactly calculated. The differences between unitary and non-unitary filtering operations are analyzed showing that, at least for systems of dimension d larger than or equal to 3, the non-unitary choice is preferable (the gap between the performances of the two cases being divergent in some cases). For d = 2 (qubit case), on the contrary, no evidences of the presence of such gap is revealed: we conjecture that for this special case unitary filtering transformations are optimal. The scenario in which more general filtering protocols are allowed is also discussed in some detail. The case of a depolarizing noise acting on a two–qubit system is exactly solved in a general case. }",

    abstract = { Recently, quantum error-correcting codes have been proposed that capitalize on the fact that many physical error models lead to a significant asymmetry between the probabilities for bit- and phase-flip errors. An example for a channel that exhibits such asymmetry is the combined amplitude damping and dephasing channel, where the probabilities of bit and phase flips can be related to relaxation and dephasing time, respectively. We study asymmetric quantum codes that are obtained from the Calderbank–Shor–Steane (CSS) construction. For such codes, we derive upper bounds on the code parameters using linear programming. A central result of this paper is the explicit construction of some new families of asymmetric quantum stabilizer codes from pairs of nested classical codes. For instance, we derive asymmetric codes using a combination of Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) and finite geometry low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We show that the asymmetric quantum codes offer two advantages, namely to allow a higher rate without sacrificing performance when compared with symmetric codes and vice versa to allow a higher performance when compared with symmetric codes of comparable rates. Our approach is based on a CSS construction that combines BCH and finite geometry LDPC codes. }

A substantial obstacle to this is the extreme fragility of quantum systems to “decoherence” from environmental noise and other control limitations. Although quantum computation is possible if the noise affecting the quantum system satisfies certain conditions, existing methods for noise characterization are intractable for present multibody systems. We introduce a technique based on symmetrization that enables direct experimental measurement of some key properties of the decoherence affecting a quantum system. Our method reduces the number of experiments required from exponential to polynomial in the number of subsystems. The technique is demonstrated for the optimization of control over nuclear spins in the solid state.}}

Unfortunately, one of the key features of quantum computers--the difficulty of describing them on classical computers--also makes it difficult to describe and understand precisely what can be done with them. A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations. States used in error correction and certain communication protocols can be described by their stabilizer, a group of tensor products of Pauli matrices. Even this simple group structure is sufficient to allow a rich range of quantum effects, although it falls short of the full power of quantum computation.},

abstract={The successful operation of quantum computers relies on protecting qubits from decoherence and noise, which---if uncorrected---will lead to erroneous results. Because these errors accumulate during an algorithm, correcting them is a key requirement for large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum information processors. Besides computational errors, which can be addressed by quantum error correction1--9, the carrier of the information can also be completely lost or the information can leak out of the computational space10--14. It is expected that such loss errors will occur at rates that are comparable to those of computational errors. Here we experimentally implement a full cycle of qubit loss detection and correction on a minimal instance of a topological surface code15,16 in a trapped-ion quantum processor. The key technique used for this correction is a quantum non-demolition measurement performed via an ancillary qubit, which acts as a minimally invasive probe that detects absent qubits while imparting the smallest quantum mechanically possible disturbance to the remaining qubits. Upon detecting qubit loss, a recovery procedure is triggered in real time that maps the logical information onto a new encoding on the remaining qubits. Although the current demonstration is performed in a trapped-ion quantum processor17, the protocol is applicable to other quantum computing architectures and error correcting codes, including leading two- and three-dimensional topological codes. These deterministic methods provide a complete toolbox for the correction of qubit loss that, together with techniques that mitigate computational errors, constitute the building blocks of complete and scalable quantum error correction.},

Further, the nucleus is assumed to be the seat of the essential part of the mass of the atom, and to have linear dimensions exceedingly small compared with the linear dimensions of the whole atom. The number of electrons in an atom is deduced to be approximately equal to half the atomic weight. Great interest is to be attributed to this atom-model; for, as Rutherford has shown, the assumption of the existence of nuclei, as those in question, seems to be necessary in order to account for the results of the experiments on large angle scattering of the $\alpha$ rays.2",

Despite its high accuracy, existing implementations of the MWPM decoder cannot catch up with quantum hardware, e.g., 1 million measurements per second for superconducting qubits. They suffer from a backlog of measurements that grows exponentially and as a result, cannot realize the power of quantum computation. We design and implement a fast MWPM decoder, called Parity Blossom, which reaches a time complexity almost proportional to the number of defect measurements. We further design and implement a parallel version of Parity Blossom called Fusion Blossom. Given a practical circuit-level noise of 0.1%, Fusion Blossom can decode a million measurement rounds per second up to a code distance of 33. Fusion Blossom also supports stream decoding mode that reaches a 0.7 ms decoding latency at code distance 21 regardless of the measurement rounds.},

PyMatching includes the standard MWPM decoder as well as a variant, which we call local matching, that restricts each syndrome defect to be matched to another defect within a local neighborhood. The decoding performance of local matching is almost identical to that of the standard MWPM decoder in practice, while reducing the computational complexity. We benchmark the performance of PyMatching, showing that local matching is several orders of magnitude faster than implementations of the full MWPM algorithm using NetworkX or Blossom V for problem sizes typically considered in error correction simulations. PyMatching and its dependencies are open-source, and it can be used to decode any quantum code for which syndrome defects come in pairs using a simple Python interface. PyMatching supports the use of weighted edges, hook errors, boundaries and measurement errors, enabling fast decoding, and simulation of fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

Our cellular automata draw inspiration from classical field theories, with a Coulomb-like potential naturally emerging from the local dynamics. For a 3D automaton coupled to a 2D toric code, we present evidence of an error correction threshold above 6.1{\%} for uncorrelated noise. A 2D automaton equipped with a more complex update rule yields a threshold above 8.2{\%}. Our framework provides decisive new tools in the quest for realising a passive dissipative quantum memory.},

abstract = {Consider a 2-D square array of qubits of extent L \texttimes{} L. We provide a proof that the minimum weight perfect matching problem associated with running a particular class of topological quantum error correction codes on this array can be exactly solved with a 2-D square array of classical computing devices, each of which is nominally associated with a fixed number N of qubits, in constant average time per round of error detection independent of L provided physical error rates are below fixed nonzero values, and other physically reasonable assumptions. This proof is applicable to the fully fault-tolerant case only, not the case of perfect stabilizer measurements.},

abstract = {Quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers known as LDPC codes have been actively studied recently due to their potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, all families of quantum LDPC codes known to this date suffer from a poor distance scaling limited by the square-root of the code length. This is in a sharp contrast with the classical case where good families of LDPC codes are known that combine constant encoding rate and linear distance. Here we propose the first family of good quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers. The new codes have a constant encoding rate, linear distance, and stabilizers acting on at most O(√n) qubits, where n is the code length. For comparison, all previously known families of good quantum codes have stabilizers of linear weight. Our proof combines two techniques: randomized constructions of good quantum codes and the homological product operation from algebraic topology. We conjecture that similar methods can produce good stabilizer codes with stabilizer weight O(nα) for any α &gt; 0.},

abstract={To date, the surface code has become a promising candidate for quantum error correcting codes because it achieves a high threshold and is composed of only the nearest gate operations and low-weight stabilizers. Here, we have exhibited that the logical failure rate can be enhanced by manipulating the lattice size of surface codes that they can show an enormous improvement in the number of physical qubits for a noise model where dephasing errors dominate over relaxation errors. We estimated the logical error rate in terms of the lattice size and physical error rate. When the physical error rate was high, the parameter estimation method was applied, and when it was low, the most frequently occurring logical error cases were considered. By using the minimum weight perfect matching decoding algorithm, we obtained the optimal lattice size by minimizing the number of qubits to achieve the required failure rates when physical error rates and bias are provided .},

abstract = {Tanner codes are long error correcting codes obtained from short codes and a graph, with bits on the edges and parity-check constraints from the short codes enforced at the vertices of the graph. Combining good short codes together with a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes. In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a c3 locally testable code by Dinur et at. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et at. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et at. code.},

abstract = {We address the problem of decoding sparse quantum error correction codes. For Pauli channels, this task can be accomplished by a version of the belief propagation algorithm used for decoding sparse classical codes. Quantum codes pose two new challenges however. Firstly, their Tanner graph unavoidably contain small loops which typically undermines the performance of belief propagation. Secondly, sparse quantum codes are by definition highly degenerate. The standard belief propagation algorithm does not exploit this feature, but rather it is impaired by it. We propose heuristic methods to improve belief propagation decoding, specifically targeted at these two problems. While our results exhibit a clear improvement due to the proposed heuristic methods, they also indicate that the main source of errors in the quantum coding scheme remains in the decoding.},

abstract={We propose an error correction procedure based on a cellular automaton, the sweep rule, which is applicable to a broad range of codes beyond topological quantum codes. For simplicity, however, we focus on the three-dimensional toric code on the rhombic dodecahedral lattice with boundaries and prove that the resulting local decoder has a non-zero error threshold. We also numerically benchmark the performance of the decoder in the setting with measurement errors using various noise models. We find that this error correction procedure is remarkably robust against measurement errors and is also essentially insensitive to the details of the lattice and noise model. Our work constitutes a step towards finding simple and high-performance decoding strategies for a wide range of quantum low-density parity-check codes.},

abstract = {We study the ±J random-plaquette Z2 gauge model (RPGM) in three spatial dimensions, a three-dimensional analog of the two-dimensional ±J random-bond Ising model (RBIM). The model is a pure Z2 gauge theory in which randomly chosen plaquettes (occurring with concentration p) have couplings with the “wrong sign” so that magnetic flux is energetically favored on these plaquettes. Excitations of the model are one-dimensional “flux tubes” that terminate at “magnetic monopoles” located inside lattice cubes that contain an odd number of wrong-sign plaquettes. Electric confinement can be driven by thermal fluctuations of the flux tubes, by the quenched background of magnetic monopoles, or by a combination of the two. Like the RBIM, the RPGM has enhanced symmetry along a “Nishimori line” in the p–T plane (where T is the temperature). The critical concentration pc of wrong-sign plaquettes at the confinement-Higgs phase transition along the Nishimori line can be identified with the accuracy threshold for robust storage of quantum information using topological error-correcting codes: if qubit phase errors, qubit bit-flip errors, and errors in the measurement of local check operators all occur at rates below pc, then encoded quantum information can be protected perfectly from damage in the limit of a large code block. Through Monte-Carlo simulations, we measure pc0, the critical concentration along the T=0 axis (a lower bound on pc), finding pc0=.0293±.0002. We also measure the critical concentration of antiferromagnetic bonds in the two-dimensional RBIM on the T=0 axis, finding pc0=.1031±.0001. Our value of pc0 is incompatible with the value of pc=.1093±.0002 found in earlier numerical studies of the RBIM, in disagreement with the conjecture that the phase boundary of the RBIM is vertical (parallel to the T axis) below the Nishimori line. The model can be generalized to a rank-r antisymmetric tensor field in d dimensions, in the presence of quenched disorder.}

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Qudit toric codes are a natural higher-dimensional generalization of the well-studied qubit toric code. However, standard methods for error correction of the qubit toric code are not applicable to them. Novel decoders are needed. In this paper we introduce two renormalization group decoders for qudit codes and analyse their error correction thresholds and efficiency. The first decoder is a generalization of a ‘hard-decisions’ decoder due to Bravyi and Haah (arXiv:1112.3252). We modify this decoder to overcome a percolation effect which limits its threshold performance for many-level quantum systems. The second decoder is a generalization of a ‘soft-decisions’ decoder due to Poulin and Duclos-Cianci (2010 Phys. Rev. Lett.  104 050504), with a small cell size to optimize the efficiency of implementation in the high dimensional case. In each case, we estimate thresholds for the uncorrelated bit-flip error model and provide a comparative analysis of the performance of both these approaches to error correction of qudit toric codes.}

abstract = {Finding efficient decoders for quantum error correcting codes adapted to realistic experimental noise in fault-tolerant devices represents a significant challenge. In this paper we introduce several decoding algorithms complemented by deep neural decoders (DND) and apply them to analyze several fault-tolerant error correction (EC) protocols such as the surface code as well as Steane and Knill EC. Our methods require no knowledge of the underlying noise model afflicting the quantum device making them appealing for real-world experiments. Our analysis is based on a full circuit-level noise model. It considers both distance-three and five codes, and is performed near the codes pseudo-threshold regime. Training DND in low noise rate regimes appears to be a challenging machine learning endeavour. We provide a detailed description of our neural network architectures and training methodology. We then discuss both the advantages and limitations of DND. Lastly, we provide a rigorous analysis of the decoding runtime of trained DND and compare our methods with anticipated gate times in future quantum devices. Given the broad applications of our decoding schemes, we believe that the methods presented in this paper could have practical applications for near term fault-tolerant experiments.}

As such, obtaining fast and flexible decoding algorithms for these codes, within the experimentally realistic and challenging context of faulty syndrome measurements, without requiring any final read-out of the physical qubits, is of critical importance. In this work, we show that the problem of decoding such codes can be naturally reformulated as a process of repeated interactions between a decoding agent and a code environment, to which the machinery of reinforcement learning can be applied to obtain decoding agents. While in principle this framework can be instantiated with environments modelling circuit level noise, we take a first step towards this goal by using deepQ learning to obtain decoding agents for a variety of simplified phenomenological noise models, which yield faulty syndrome measurements without including the propagation of errors which arise in full circuit level noise models.}

abstract={There has been a rise in decoding quantum error correction codes with neural network--based decoders, due to the good decoding performance achieved and adaptability to any noise model. However, the main challenge is scalability to larger code distances due to an exponential increase of the error syndrome space. Note that successfully decoding the surface code under realistic noise assumptions will limit the size of the code to less than 100 qubits with current neural network--based decoders. Such a problem can be tackled by a distributed way of decoding, similar to the renormalization group (RG) decoders. In this paper, we introduce a decoding algorithm that combines the concept of RG decoding and neural network--based decoders. We tested the decoding performance under depolarizing noise with noiseless error syndrome measurements for the rotated surface code and compared against the blossom algorithm and a neural network--based decoder. We show that a similar level of decoding performance can be achieved between all tested decoders while providing a solution to the scalability issues of neural network--based decoders.},

At this interface of classical and quantum computing the technique of machine learning has appeared as a way to tailor such an algorithm to the specific error processes of an experiment—without the need for a priori knowledge of the error model. Here, we apply this technique to topological color codes. We demonstrate that a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory cells can be trained to reduce the error rate ϵL of the encoded logical qubit to values much below the error rate ϵphys of the physical qubits—fitting the expected power law scaling , with d the code distance. The neural network incorporates the information from ‘flag qubits’ to avoid reduction in the effective code distance caused by the circuit. As a test, we apply the neural network decoder to a density-matrix based simulation of a superconducting quantum computer, demonstrating that the logical qubit has a longer life-time than the constituting physical qubits with near-term experimental parameters.}

This allows us to quantify exactly “how much” NP-completeness is in these problems.

abstract = {Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is an essential field of research towards the realization of large-scale quantum computers. On the theoretical side, a lot of effort is put into designing error-correcting codes that protect quantum data from errors, which inevitably happen due to the noisy nature of quantum hardware and quantum bits (qubits). Protecting data with an error-correcting code necessitates means to recover the original data, given a potentially corrupted data set---a task referred to as decoding. It is vital that decoding algorithms can recover error-free states in an efficient manner. While theoretical properties of certain QEC methods have been extensively studied, good techniques to analyze their performance in practically more relevant settings is still a widely unexplored area. In this work, we propose a set of software tools that facilitate numerical experiments with so-called Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check codes (QLDPC codes)---a broad class of codes, some of which have recently been shown to be asymptotically good. Based on that, we provide an implementation of a general decoder for QLDPC codes. On top of that, we propose a highly efficient heuristic decoder that eliminates the runtime bottlenecks of the general QLDPC decoder while still maintaining comparable decoding performance. These tools eventually make it possible to confirm theoretical results around QLDPC codes in a more practical setting and showcase the value of software tools (in addition to theoretical considerations) for investigating codes for practical applications. The resulting tool, which is publicly available at https://github.com/cda-tum/qecc as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), is meant to provide a playground for the search for "practically good" quantum codes.},

abstract = {The threshold theorem is a seminal result in the field of quantum computing asserting that arbitrarily long quantum computations can be performed on a faulty quantum computer provided that the noise level is below some constant threshold. This remarkable result comes at the price of increasing the number of qubits (quantum bits) by a large factor that scales polylogarithmically with the size of the quantum computation we wish to realize. Minimizing the space overhead for fault-tolerant quantum computation is a pressing challenge that is crucial to benefit from the computational potential of quantum devices.In this paper, we study the asymptotic scaling of the space overhead needed for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that the polylogarithmic factor in the standard threshold theorem is in fact not needed and that there is a fault-tolerant construction that uses a number of qubits that is only a constant factor more than the number of qubits of the ideal computation. This result was conjectured by Gottesman who suggested to replace the concatenated codes from the standard threshold theorem by quantum error-correcting codes with a constant encoding rate. The main challenge was then to find an appropriate family of quantum codes together with an efficient classical decoding algorithm working even with a noisy syndrome. The efficiency constraint is crucial here: bear in mind that qubits are inherently noisy and that faults keep accumulating during the decoding process. The role of the decoder is therefore to keep the number of errors under control during the whole computation.On a technical level, our main contribution is the analysis of the SMALL-SET-FLIP decoding algorithm applied to the family of quantum expander codes. We show that it can be parallelized to run in constant time while correcting sufficiently many errors on both the qubits and the syndrome to keep the error under control. These tools can be seen as a quantum generalization of the BIT-FLIP algorithm applied to the (classical) expander codes of Sipser and Spielman.},

journal = {Quantum Science and Technology},
abstract = {Implementing algorithms on a fault-tolerant quantum computer will require fast decoding throughput and latency times to prevent an exponential increase in buffer times between the applications of gates. In this work we begin by quantifying these requirements. We then introduce the construction of local neural network (NN) decoders using three-dimensional convolutions. These local decoders are adapted to circuit-level noise and can be applied to surface code volumes of arbitrary size. Their application removes errors arising from a certain number of faults, which serves to substantially reduce the syndrome density. Remaining errors can then be corrected by a global decoder, such as Blossom or union find, with their implementation significantly accelerated due to the reduced syndrome density. However, in the circuit-level setting, the corrections applied by the local decoder introduce many vertical pairs of highlighted vertices. To obtain a low syndrome density in the presence of vertical pairs, we consider a strategy of performing a syndrome collapse which removes many vertical pairs and reduces the size of the decoding graph used by the global decoder. We also consider a strategy of performing a vertical cleanup, which consists of removing all local vertical pairs prior to implementing the global decoder. By applying our local NN decoder and the vertical cleanup strategy to a d = 17 surface code volume, we show a  speedup of the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder. Lastly, we estimate the cost of implementing our local decoders on field programmable gate arrays.}

abstract={Error-corrected quantum computers can only work if errors are small and uncorrelated. Here, I show how cosmic rays or stray background radiation affects superconducting qubits by modeling the phonon to electron/quasiparticle down-conversion physics. For present designs, the model predicts about 57{\%} of the radiation energy breaks Cooper pairs into quasiparticles, which then vigorously suppress the qubit energy relaxation time (T1{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}600{\thinspace}ns) over a large area (cm) and for a long time (ms). Such large and correlated decay kills error correction. Using this quantitative model, I show how this energy can be channeled away from the qubit so that this error mechanism can be reduced by many orders of magnitude. I also comment on how this affects other solid-state qubits.},

abstract={Large-scale quantum computers have the potential to hold computational capabilities beyond conventional computers. However, the physical qubits are prone to noise which must be corrected in order to perform fault-tolerant quantum computations. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) provides the path for realizing such computations. QEC generates a continuous stream of data that decoders must process at the rate it is received, which can be as fast as 1 $\mu$s per QEC round in superconducting quantum computers. If the decoder infrastructure cannot keep up, a data backlog problem is encountered and the computation runs exponentially slower. Today's leading approaches to quantum error correction are not scalable as existing decoders typically run slower as the problem size is increased, inevitably hitting the backlog problem. Here, we show how to parallelize decoding to achieve almost arbitrary speed, removing this roadblock to scalability. Our parallelization requires some classical feed forward decisions to be delayed, slowing-down the logical clock speed. However, the slow-down is now only polynomial in the size of the QEC code, averting the exponential slowdown. We numerically demonstrate our parallel decoder for the surface code, showing no noticeable reduction in logical fidelity compared to previous decoders and demonstrating the predicted speedup.},
