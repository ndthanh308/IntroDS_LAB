  "abstract": "Cyber-physical microgrids are vulnerable to stealth attacks that can degrade their stability and operability by performing low-magnitude manipulations in a coordinated manner. This paper formulates the interactions between CSAs and microgrid defenders as a non-cooperative, zero-sum game. Additionally, it presents a hybrid Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy for distributed microgrids that can dynamically alter local control gains to achieve resiliency against Coordinated Stealth Attacks (CSAs). The proposed strategy reduces the success probability of attack(s) by making system dynamics less predictable. The framework also identifies and removes malicious injections by modifying secondary control weights assigned to them. The manipulated signals are reconstructed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Digital Twin (DT) to preserve stability. To guarantee additional immunity against instability arising from gain alterations, MTD decisions are also validated (via utility and best response computations) using the DT before actual implementation. The DT is also used to find the minimum perturbation that defenders must achieve to invalidate an attacker's knowledge effectively.",
