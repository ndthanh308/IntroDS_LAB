We describe a new transform for pattern representation that interprets patterns as probability density functions, and has special properties with regards to classification. The transform, which we denote as the Cumulative Distribution Transform (CDT), is invertible, with well defined forward and inverse operations. We show that it can be useful in ‘parsing out’ variations (confounds) that are ‘Lagrangian’ (displacement and intensity variations) by converting these to ‘Eulerian’ (intensity variations) in transform space. This conversion is the basis for our main result that describes when the \{CDT\} can allow for linear classification to be possible in transform space. We also describe several properties of the transform and show, with computational experiments that used both real and simulated data, that the \{CDT\} can help render a variety of real world problems simpler to solve.
