  "abstract": "This paper presents an AI-assisted programming tool called Copilot for Xcode for program composition and design to support human software developers. By seamlessly integrating cloud-based Large Language Models (LLM) with Apple's local development environment, Xcode, this tool enhances productivity and unleashes creativity for software development in Apple software ecosystem (e.g., iOS apps, macOS). Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, Copilot for Xcode effectively processes source code tokens and patterns within code repositories, enabling features such as code generation, autocompletion, documentation, and error detection. Software developers can also query and make \"small\" decisions for program composition, some of which can be made simultaneously, and this is facilitated through prompt engineering in a chat interface of Copilot for Xcode. Finally, we present simple case studies as evidence of the effectiveness of utilizing NLP in Xcode to prompt popular LLM services like OpenAI ChatGPT for program composition and design.",
