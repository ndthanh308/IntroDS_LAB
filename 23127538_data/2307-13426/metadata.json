  "abstract": "In this short paper, we consider a form of higher-order rewriting with a call-by-value evaluation strategy so as to model call-by-value programs. We briefly present a cost-size semantics to call-by-value rewriting: a class of algebraic interpretations that map terms to tuples that bound both the reductions' cost and the size of normal forms.",
