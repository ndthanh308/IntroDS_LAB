  "abstract": "Given an allotment of land divided into parcels, government decision-makers, private developers, and conservation biologists can collaborate to select which parcels to protect, in order to accomplish sustainable ecological goals with various constraints. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer optimization model that considers the presence of multiple species on these parcels, subject to predator-prey relationships and crowding effects.",
