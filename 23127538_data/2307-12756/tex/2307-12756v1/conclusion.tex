\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
In this paper, we propose a framework ULC to address the delayed feedback problem in the offline setting via unbiased label correction. The key idea is that delayed feedback leads to and only leads to incorrect labels. If the incorrect labels can be effectively corrected, the delayed feedback problem can be well addressed. ULC uses an additional LC model to guide the CVR prediction model for unbiased label correction and enhances the performance through alternative training. We prove theoretically that the label-corrected loss in our method is an unbiased estimate of the oracle loss. Comparative experiments on both public and private datasets and detailed analyses show that ULC effectively alleviates the delayed feedback problem and consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.

For future work, we are interested in the following points. First, using multiple and dynamic counterfactual deadlines is likely to exploit training data more effectively. Second, given that samples with a long delay time are more likely to be hard samples, we would like to design approaches to enhance the model performance on long-delay samples. Third, we are interested in the combination of our method to selection bias in CVR prediction.
