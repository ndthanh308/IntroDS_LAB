    % Context 
Multi-agent market model is a stock trading simulation system, which generates order flow given the agent variable of the model.  
    % problem
We study calibrating the agent variable to simulate the order flow of any given historical trading day. 
    % Gap
In contrast to the traditional calibration that relies on the inefficient iterative search, 
we propose \sysname{}, the first search-free approach that uses deep learning to calibrate multi-agent market model. 
    % Approach
\sysname{} learns from a novel surrogate-trading loss function to address the non-differentiable issue induced by the multi-agent model
and introduces a condition-aware variable estimator, adapting the trading simulation to different market conditions to enhance explainability.
    % Result
Through extensive experiments on real order-book data over a whole year, 
\sysname{} has demonstrated comparable simulation accuracy ($<$0.36 in Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic) to traditional search-based approaches
without the need for variable search, 
and can effectively capture the correlation between agent variable and multiple market-condition indexes~(PPI, PMI, CPI, market trend and market noise).

\iffalse

Multi-agent market simulation creates a system where multiple agents automatically trade through an order book,
which enables many interactive Fintech studies. 
To enhance the fidelity of simulation under various market conditions, 
the system requires calibration of the agent variables such that it can spontaneously generate realistic order flows of historical trading days.
    % Gap: inefficient and unexplainable
Previous calibration approaches are inefficient because they rely on the tedious and arbitrary variable search with unpredictable convergence. 
% Due to randomness, 
Furthermore, the calibrated agent variables are difficult to interpret due to the search randomness. 
    % Problem
We propose \sysname{}, a search-free and explainable calibration approach for multi-agent market simulation system.   
It calibrates agent variables using the deep features of realistic order flows 
and enables interpreting agent variables using the indexes of market conditions~(e.g., PPI and PMI). 
    % Approach
\sysname{} utilizes a surrogate-trading loss function to minimize the training requirement of the calibration learning and
introduces a condition adapter to fine-tune the agent variables according to market conditions. 
    % Result
Through extensive experiments on real order-book data over a whole year, 
\sysname{} has achieved satisfied accuracy (less than 0.36 in KS statistics) in reproducing order flows without variable searching, 
while capturing a reasonable correlation between agent variables and multiple indexes of market conditions.
