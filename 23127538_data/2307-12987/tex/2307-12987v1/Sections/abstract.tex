    Order-driven market simulation mimics the trader behaviors to 
    generate order streams to support interactive studies of financial 
    strategies. In market simulator, the multi-agent approach is commonly 
    adopted due to its explainability.  Existing multi-agent systems employ 
    heuristic search to generate order streams, which is inefficient for 
    large-scale simulation.  Furthermore, the search-based behavior 
    calibration often leads to inconsistent trader actions under the same 
    general market condition, making the simulation results unstable and 
    difficult to interpret.  
    
    We propose \sysname{}, the first search-free calibration approach
    multi-agent market simulator which achieves large-scale efficiency and 
    behavior consistency.  \sysname{} uses meta-learning and 
    devises a surrogate trading system with a consistency loss function for 
    the reproducibility of order stream and trader behaviors.  Extensive 
    experiments in the market replay and case studies show that \sysname{} 
    achieves state-of-the-art in terms of order stream 
    reproduction with consistent trader behavior and
    can capture patterns of real markets.

    Market simulation mimics the trader behaviors to generate order streams, 
    which enables various interactive studies for financial industry. 
    Multi-agent system is commonly adopted for market simulation due to its satisfying explanability. 
    Various types of agents are carefully devised for multi-agent simulation, though, 
    the behavior~(parameters) of these agents require calibration to achieve high fidelity to reality. 
    Existing calibration works fail to consider the dependency of the trader behaviors over time, 
    leading to possible false calibration that drifts the simulation results from reality. 

    In this paper,  
    we propose \sysname{}, a calibration system for multi-agent simulation that observes two market regularities: 
    temporal and market state consistency. 
    Different from existing schemes based on heuristic searching, 
    \sysname{} is the first end-to-end system that directly analyzes simulated order stream with market states for calibration. 
    To guarantee its generality, we design \sysname{} based on meta-learning and 
    devise a surrogate trading system and a consistency loss to enforce 
    its consistent calibration in temporal and market states.
    \sysname{} is easy to implement and enables painless searching-free calibrations for multi-agent market simulation.
    We verify its performance by experiments in market replay and 
    validate its generality by case studies in market hypothesis that modifies market states.
    The experimental results show that \sysname{} can achieve similar order stream reproduction to existing arts while complying with the consistency rules.
    The case studies of market hypothesis justifies the ability of \sysname{} to capture some regularities of real markets.

 Market simulation mimics the trader behaviors to generate order streams,
    which enables various interactive studies for financial applications.
    Multi-agent system is commonly adopted for market simulation because of its satisfying explainability.
    Existing behavior calibration approaches for multi-agent systems leverage heuristic search to achieve order stream reproduction.
    However, these approaches require multiple search iterations with simulations, 
    making them inefficient in large-scale simulations.
    Furthermore, failing to consider the calibrate redundancy issue due to the multi-agent system property, 
    the current approaches may produce different behaviors for a target order stream, 
    making the resultant simulations unstable and arbitrary.
    
    In this paper,  
    we leverage the commonality of the calibration experiences to achieve  efficiency
    and introduce patterns from real markets~(by considering behavior consistency) to reduce the calibration redundancy.
    We propose \sysname{}, an efficient and behavior-consistent calibration system for multi-agent simulation.
    \sysname{} is the first searching-free calibration for multi-agent market simulation. 
    To guarantee its generality, we involve meta-learning in its design and
    devise a surrogate trading system and a consistency loss function to reconcile 
    order stream reproduction with behavior consistency.
