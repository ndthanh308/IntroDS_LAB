\section{Conclusion}\label{sec: conclude}

Multi-agent market simulation generates order streams through agent interactions.
To enable the simulation that reflects reality, 
the agents need careful calibration of their behaviors.
% where the agents require calibration on behavior parameters.
Existing calibration approaches heuristically search behavior parameters 
for reproducing the target order stream.
However, failing to accumulate calibration episteme, 
existing approaches undergo the tedious searching process, independently, for each trading day, 
making their applications hard to scale up.
Furthermore, due to the randomness and dynamics of the system, 
it is possible that more than one sets of parameters~(redundancy) contribute to similar order streams --
% which may lead to false calibration that jeopardizes further interventional studies on the simulation system.
% leading to different simulation results with further interventional studies, such as trading strategy back-testing.
these parameters can perform differently with further interventional studies, such as trading strategy back-testing, 
making simulation unstable and random.

In this paper,
we aim to build a calibration system without parameter searching.
Since behavior parameters dominate the simulation system, resulting in the generated order streams,
we can explore behavior information from the target order stream for reproduction,
which captures the calibration knowledge between trading days.
To tackle the parameter redundancy, 
we argue that calibration should observe some patterns of the real market and propose two consistency rules:
temporal and market state consistency.
% In this paper, 
% we argue that calibration on the multi-agent simulation should comply with some market regularities.
% We observe that the overall behaviors of the market participants are dependent over time; thus,
% we propose two  consistency rules besides order stream reproduction: temporal and market state consistency.
To enforce the observations, 
we propose \sysname{}, a behavior-consistent calibration system for multi-agent simulation.
\sysname{} is the first searching-free calibration system that directly 
analyzes order stream and market states to produce behavior parameters in an end-to-end manner.
To achieve calibration generality to unseen trading days, 
% \sysname{} jointly considers order stream and market state by a meta-market.
\sysname{} is designed based on meta-learning and trained 
by a proposed surrogate trading system. 
To observe the two consistency rules,
we propose a consistency loss function.
% and a consistency loss function, respectively,
% facilitating the meta-market to learn to reproduce while observing behavior consistency.
% \sysname{} accumulates historical episteme  on calibration by training once and can be applied to unseen scenarios.
We have conducted large-scale experiments~(the largest, to the best of our knowledge) to verify our approach by market replay and case studies.
The experimental results of market replay show that \sysname{}
can achieve similar order stream reproduction while observing the consistency rules.
 The case studies show that \sysname{} can reflect some patterns of the real market.
