  "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) based contrast dose reduction and elimination in MRI imaging is gaining traction, given the detrimental effects of Gadolinium-based Contrast Agents (GBCAs). These DL algorithms are however limited by the availability of high quality low dose datasets. Additionally, different types of GBCAs and pathologies require different dose levels for the DL algorithms to work reliably. In this work, we formulate a novel transformer (Gformer) based iterative modelling approach for the synthesis of images with arbitrary contrast enhancement that corresponds to different dose levels. The proposed Gformer incorporates a sub-sampling based attention mechanism and a rotational shift module that captures the various contrast related features. Quantitative evaluation indicates that the proposed model performs better than other state-of-the-art methods. We further perform quantitative evaluation on downstream tasks such as dose reduction and tumor segmentation to demonstrate the clinical utility.",
