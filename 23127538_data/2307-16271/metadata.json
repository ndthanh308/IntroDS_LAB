  "abstract": "This work concerns representations of a finite flat group scheme $G$, defined over a noetherian commutative ring $R$. The focus is on lattices, namely, finitely generated $G$-modules that are projective as $R$-modules, and on the full subcategory of all $G$-modules projective over $R$ generated by the lattices. The stable category of such $G$-modules is a rigidly-compactly generated, tensor triangulated category. The main result is that this stable category is stratified and costratified by the natural action of the cohomology ring of $G$. Applications include formulas for computing the support and cosupport of tensor products and the module of homomorphisms, and a classification of the thick ideals in the stable category of lattices.",
