  "abstract": "For a positive integer $n$ and a finite simplicial complex $K$, we describe an algorithmic procedure constructing a maximal discrete gradient field $W(K,n)$ on Abrams' discretized configuration space $\\text{DConf}(K,n)$. Computer experimentation shows that the field is generically optimal. We study the field $W(K,n)$ for $n=2$ and $K=Δ^{m,d}$, the $d$-dimensional skeleton of the $m$-dimensional simplex. In particular, we prove that $\\text{DConf}(Δ^{m,d},2)$ is $(\\min\\{d,m-1\\}-1)$-connected, has torsion-free homology and admits a minimal cell structure. We compute the Betti numbers of $\\text{DConf}(Δ^{m,d},2)$ and, for certain values of $d$, we prove that $\\text{DConf}(Δ^{m,d},2)$ breaks, up to homotopy, as a wedge of (not necessarily equidimensional) spheres.",
