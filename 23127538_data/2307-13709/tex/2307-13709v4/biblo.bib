address = {New York, NY, USA},
abstract = {The existing rating system, as the foundation of estimating results of competitive sports and games, has problems of insufficient use of competing information and the unilateral considering of competing process modeling. In this paper, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) of go based on reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) was used to obtain the winning rate during progress of the matches. Also, the Neural Network Go Rating (NNGR) model considering the winning rate was established on the basis of classical Bradley-Terry model, using Mini-Batch Gradient Descent Method to calculate efficiently. History decay method was adopted to improve the time efficiency when dealing with long-span match data. The experiment results and analysis on actual go matches indicated that NNGR model showed excellent objectivity and stability, and higher prediction accuracy compared with Elo, TrueSkill and Whole-History Rating (WHR) algorithms.},
