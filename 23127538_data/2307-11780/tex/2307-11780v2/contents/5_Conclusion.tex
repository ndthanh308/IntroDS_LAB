\section{Conclusion}

\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a novel encoding scheme to describe multivariate patterns in event sequence data.
Based on this encoding scheme, we can discover informative patterns that preserve correlations among multiple attributes and highlight any single value noises in the dataset.
To efficiently surface these multivariate patterns from the original sequences, we propose \textsc{Beep}, an MDL-based heuristic algorithm with a tailored acceleration algorithm.
Through a case study on a real-world dataset and quantitative experiments on multi-scaled synthetic data, we prove that our algorithm strikes a good balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

In the future, we plan to integrate more domain knowledge into \textsc{Beep} (e.g., encoding domain knowledge as constraints on the patterns \cite{wu2022rasipam}) to further enhance its effectiveness.
Some subsequences may be frequent (thus summarized by the mining algorithm) but cannot reveal players' playing styles (thus are not worth analyzing).
We also plan to use GPU to accelerate \textsc{Beep} to enhance its efficiency.
Note that covering each sequence with the code table can be parallel.
