\section{Definition of Subsequence}

\label{app:subsequence}

This section introduces the formal definition of ``subsequence'' in Section \ref{sec:Predefinitions} (each pattern $p$ is a subsequence of numerous sequences in $S$).
We introduces the definition in two steps.

First, we define $e^a\preceq e^b$ to indicate that event $e^a$ preserves some attributes of event $e^b$ and drops others, i.e., $e^a$ is part of $e^b$ (e.g., in Figure \ref{fig:patterndef}, $e_1$ of $p_1$, which drops the first attribute, is part of $e_1$ of $s_1$).
Formally, assume that $I$ is the set that includes the indexes of all the attributes to be preserved (i.e., some integers between 1 and $|A|$). For each $1\leq k\leq |A|$, if $k \in I$, $e^a$ has the same $k$-th value as $e^b$.
Otherwise, the $k$-th value of $e^a$ is empty.

Second, we define $s^a \subseteq s^b$ to indicate that sequence $s^a=(e^a_1, ..., e^a_n)$ is a subsequence of sequence $s_b=(e^b_1, ..., e^b_m)$, if there exist integers $1\leq i_1\le i_2\le ...\le i_n\leq m$ such that $e^a_j\preceq e^b_{i_j}$ for each $1\leq j\leq n$.
