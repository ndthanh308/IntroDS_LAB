We implemented \textsc{Beep} in C++ and have open-sourced the code for research purposes\footnote{https://github.com/BEEP-algorithm/BEEP-algorithm}.
A computer with a 2 GHz CPU and 16 GB of memory was used in all experiments.
We first worked with analysts to conduct an empirical study on a real-world dataset, collecting their feedback on the number of patterns, the effectiveness of missing values, and the correlations among multiple attributes.
We further conducted quantitative experiments on multi-scaled synthetic datasets to compare \textsc{Beep} with the state-of-art multivariate pattern mining algorithm to evaluate the performance of \textsc{Beep}.
