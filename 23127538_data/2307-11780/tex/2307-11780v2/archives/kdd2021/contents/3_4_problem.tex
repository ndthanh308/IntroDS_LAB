\subsection{Problem Definition}

Before introducing our algorithm for obtaining the optimal model, we formally define our problem as follows.

\textbf{Optimal Pattern Set Problem.} \textit{Suppose that $A$ is a set of categorical attributes with finite values, and $S$ is a dataset of multivariate event sequences over these $|A|$ attributes. Find a set of multivariate patterns $P$ so that a cover $C$ of $S$ using $P$ can be found to obtain the minimum description length L(CT~|~C) + L(S~|~CT).}

For a problem like this, there exists a large search space, which leads to high runtime complexity.
First, because any subsequences of a sequence $s_i \in S$ can be a pattern, and thousands of sequences may exist, the set of patterns can be innumerable.
Second, given a set of patterns, we can cover $S$ in different ways.
We need to search for both the optimal set of patterns and the optimal way to cover the dataset.
When we introduce missing values, the search space becomes even larger. A pattern may not be a subsequence of any sequence in the dataset. And when using a pattern to cover a sequence, some values in the pattern may not necessarily appear in the sequence. In the next section, we explain how \textsc{Beep} can search this large space efficiently.
