\section{Algorithms}

\label{sec:F4M}

In this section, we introduce our algorithm, \textbf{BEEP}, to tackle the two challenges of covering the dataset and summarizing the optimal model.
The covering algorithm (Section \ref{sec:coverAlgorithm}) accepts the model summarized by the summarizing algorithm (Section \ref{sec:summarizing}) as input.
The summarizing algorithm optimizes the model iteratively according to the cover provided by the covering algorithm.
