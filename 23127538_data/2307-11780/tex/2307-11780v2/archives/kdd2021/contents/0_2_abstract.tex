  Pattern mining is essential for the analysis of event sequence data.
  However, analysis of multivariate event sequence data, a common type of real-world data where each event includes multiple attributes, requires pattern mining algorithms to be highly effective and efficient.
  In this paper, we propose \textsc{Beep}, a novel algorithm that can efficiently discover a small set of meaningful patterns based on the Minimum Description Length principle.
  In particular, \textsc{Beep} introduces a new encoding scheme to discover patterns that can reveal correlations among multiple attributes and are highly tolerant of noise.
  Furthermore, \textsc{Beep} applies a tailored acceleration method based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing, which can greatly reduce the time for summarizing patterns.
  Empirical study on a real-world dataset shows that patterns discovered by \textsc{Beep} help analysts gain new and effective insights, while quantitative experiments on multi-scaled synthetic data show that our algorithm can discover these meaningful patterns about 5 times faster than the current state-of-art algorithm.
