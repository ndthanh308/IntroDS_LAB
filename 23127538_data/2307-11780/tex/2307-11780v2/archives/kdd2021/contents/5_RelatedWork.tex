Over the decades, a number of sequential pattern mining algorithms, using a variety of different methods, have been built to analyze multivariate event sequences.

% SPM
Some traditional pattern mining algorithms use \textit{Breadth-First Search} (BFS) or \textit{Depth-First Search} (DFS) to search for patterns \cite{fournier2017survey}.
These algorithms require the number of occurrences of a pattern to be higher than a particular \textit{minimum support} threshold.
MSDD \cite{oates1996searching} was one of the first multivariate sequential pattern mining algorithms, and applied BFS to detect multi-stream dependency.
Tatti et al. \cite{tatti2011mining} presented an efficient BFS-based algorithm for discovering episodes with simultaneous events.
An algorithm by Wu et al. \cite{wu2013mining} assigned various levels of importance to different events that occurred simultaneously, in order to discover episodes with high utility.
TSKR \cite{morchen2007efficient} and CTMiner \cite{chen2010efficient} discovered patterns from datasets with interval-based events that might overlap.
All of these algorithms are susceptible to the well-known problem of \textit{pattern explosion} \cite{menger2015experimental} -- meaning that they return few patterns when the \textit{minimum support} is large, but a myriad of patterns when the threshold is loosened, making it challenging to determine the right threshold to obtain an appropriate number of patterns.

% MDL
Compared to more traditional pattern mining algorithms, MDL-based methods summarize a set of patterns to describe the entire sequence dataset instead of searching for each pattern, thus avoiding \textit{pattern explosion}.
Siebes et al. \cite{siebes2006item} first proposed applying the MDL principle to sequential pattern mining.
\textsc{Krimp} \cite{vreeken2011krimp} extended this theory and introduced a robust algorithm.
\textsc{Sqs} \cite{tatti2012long} defined an encoding scheme for finding serial episodes instead of itemsets.
Chen et al. \cite{chen2017sequence} and Deng et al. \cite{deng2019airvis} supported visual analytics and interactive exploration for the summarized patterns.
These algorithms, however, all worked for univariate sequence data.

% Multivariate
\textsc{Ditto} \cite{bertens2016keeping} first presented an MDL-based pattern mining algorithm for multivariate event sequences.
% however, \textsc{Ditto} cannot discover single-value noise.
\textsc{StreamScope} \cite{kawabata2018streamscope} was specifically designed to discover patterns in multi-dimensional data streams instead of static sequences.
Wu et al. \cite{wu2020visual} applied MDL to real-world applications and visualized multivariate patterns.
Compared with aforementioned multivariate pattern mining algorithm, our proposed method can handle single-value noises using a new encoding scheme.
Moreover, we employ an LSH-based acceleration to efficiently summarize patterns.
