\section{Conclusion}

\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a novel encoding scheme to describe multivariate patterns in event sequence data.
Based on this encoding scheme, we can discover informative patterns that preserve correlations among multiple attributes and highlight any singleton noises in the dataset.
To efficiently surface these multivariate patterns from the original sequences, we propose \textsc{Beep}, an MDL-based heuristic algorithm made more efficient with LSH.
Through and empirical study on a real-world dataset and quantitative experiments on multi-scaled synthetic data, we prove that our algorithm strikes a good balance between effectiveness and efficiency.
