  Modeling each hit as a multivariate event in racket sports and conducting sequential analysis aids in assessing player/team performance and identifying successful tactics for coaches and analysts.
  However, the complex correlations among multiple event attributes require pattern mining algorithms to be highly effective and efficient.
  % --------- OUR APPROACH --------- %
  This paper proposes \textsc{Beep} to discover meaningful multivariate patterns in racket sports.
  In particular, \textsc{Beep} introduces a new encoding scheme to discover patterns with correlations among multiple attributes and high-level tolerances of noise.
  Moreover, \textsc{Beep} applies an algorithm based on LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) to accelerate summarizing patterns.
  % --------- RESULTS --------- %
  We conducted a case study on a table tennis dataset and quantitative experiments on multi-scaled synthetic datasets to compare \textsc{Beep} with the SOTA multivariate pattern mining algorithm.
  Results showed that \textsc{Beep} can effectively discover patterns and noises to help analysts gain insights.
  Moreover, \textsc{Beep} was about five times faster than the SOTA algorithm.
