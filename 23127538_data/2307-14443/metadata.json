  "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the behaviour of the fixed subgroups of endomorphisms of free-abelian times free (FATF) groups. We exhibit an algorithm which, given a finitely generated subgroup $\\mathcal{H}$ of a FATF group $\\mathcal{G}$, decides whether $\\mathcal{H}$ is the fixed subgroup of some (finite) family of endomorphisms of $\\mathcal{G}$ and, in the affirmative case, it finds such a family. The algorithm combines both combinatorial and algebraic methods.",
