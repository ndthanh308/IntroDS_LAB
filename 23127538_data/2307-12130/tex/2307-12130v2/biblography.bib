   abstract = {In the last decade, a technology of thermal imagers was developing on the basis of new infrared detectors, as well for civil and military uses. These imagers implement miniaturised infrared detectors laid out in a matrix placed in the optical focal plane of the imager. The technology of the FPA associates the detector matrix to specific electronics allowing detection and addressing on each pixel. This technology allowed a fast improvement of the performance of the thermal imager. Nevertheless, their use in thermography measurement requires some metrological care. The principal problem is both the uniformization of the pixel's response and the temporal stability of this uniformization. The second problem consists in the compensation of the thermal drift. In this paper, we present some practical solutions developed by CEDIP infrared systems to perform non uniformity and thermal drift corrections. Performance and limits are reviewed.},

   abstract = {Correction of photoresponse nonuniformity in infrared staring sensor arrays is investigated. A general nonuniformity correction procedure is proposed. The procedure is based on multiple irradiation sources and on least square fit approximations to the individual pixel response characteristics. Nonlinearities of the signal response are taken into account. A correctability figure of merit is defined which may be used to estimate the residual fixed-pattern noise after correction. The correction procedure and the correctability are applied to a real data set measured by a 64 x 64 element infrared focal plane array (FPA). It is shown that an offset correction is insufficient for this data set and that a linear correction reduces the fixed-pattern noise contribution to the magnitude of the temporal noise background. The residual uncorrected fixed pattern noise can be related to pixels showing large temporal noise.},

   abstract = {Infrared (IR) cameras based on microbolometer focal plane arrays (FPAs) are the most widely used cameras in thermography. New fields of applications like handheld devices and small distributed sensors benefit from the latest sensor improvements in terms of cost and size reduction. In order to compensate for disturbing influences derived from changing ambient conditions, radiometric cameras use an optical shutter for online recalibration purposes, partially also together with sensor temperature stabilization. For these new applications, IR cameras should consist only of infrared optics, a sensor array, and digital signal processing (DSP). For acceptable measurement uncertainty values without using an optical shutter (shutter-less), the disturbing influences of changing thermal conditions have to be treated based on temperature measurements of the camera interior. We propose a compensation approach based on calibration measurements under controlled ambient conditions. All correction parameters are determined during the calibration process. Without sensor temperature stabilization (TEC-less), the pixel responsivity is also affected by the camera temperature changes and has to be considered separately. This paper presents the details of the compensation procedure and discusses relevant aspects to gain low temperature measurement uncertainty. The residual measurement uncertainty values are compared to the shutter-based compensation approach.},

This work offers a method to obtain the super-resolution of IR images from low-power devices to enhance plant traits. The method is based on deep learning (DL). Most calculations are done in the low-resolution domain. The results of each layer are aggregated together to allow a better flow of information through the network. This work shows that good results can be achieved using depthwise separable convolution with roughly 300K multiply-accumulate computations (MACs), while state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-based super-resolution algorithms are performed with around 1500K MACs. MTF analysis of the proposed method shows a real &#x00D7;4 improvement in the spatial resolution of the system, out-preforming the diffraction limit.

In this exposition, we extensively compare more than 30 state-of-the-art super-resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over three classical and three recently introduced challenging datasets to benchmark single image super-resolution. We introduce a taxonomy for deep learning–based super-resolution networks that groups existing methods into nine categories including linear, residual, multi-branch, recursive, progressive, attention-based, and adversarial designs. We also provide comparisons between the models in terms of network complexity, memory footprint, model input and output, learning details, the type of network losses, and important architectural differences (e.g., depth, skip-connections, filters). The extensive evaluation performed shows the consistent and rapid growth in the accuracy in the past few years along with a corresponding boost in model complexity and the availability of large-scale datasets. It is also observed that the pioneering methods identified as the benchmarks have been significantly outperformed by the current contenders. Despite the progress in recent years, we identify several shortcomings of existing techniques and provide future research directions towards the solution of these open problems.

Non-contact IR thermometers (NCITs) and IR thermographs (IRTs) have been used for fever screening in public areas such as airports. While NCITs remain a more popular choice than IRTs, there has been increasing evidences in the literature that IRTs can provide great accuracy in estimating body temperature if qualified systems are used and appropriate procedures are consistently applied. In this study, we addressed the issue of IRT qualification by implementing and evaluating a battery of test methods for objective, quantitative assessment of IRT performance based on a recent international standard (IEC 80601-2-59). We tested two commercial IRTs to evaluate their stability and drift, image uniformity, minimum resolvable temperature difference, and radiometric temperature laboratory accuracy. Based on these tests, we illustrated how experimental and data processing procedures could affect results, and suggested methods for clarifying and optimizing test methods. Overall, the insights into thermograph standardization and acquisition methods provided by this study may improve the utility of IR thermography and aid in comparing IRT performance, thus improving the potential for producing high quality disease pandemic countermeasures.},

abstract = {Infrared imaging is crucial for condition monitoring as the thermographic patterns will differ depending on the fault or machine condition. Currently, a limited number of machine faults have been studied using thermal imaging. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel automatic fault detection system using infrared imaging, focussing on bearings of rotating machinery. The set of bearing faults monitored contain faults for which state-of-the-art techniques have no general solutions such as bearing-lubricant starvation. For each fault, several recordings are made using different bearings to ensure generalization of the fault-detection system. The system contains two image-processing pipelines, each with their own respective purposes. The first pipeline focusses on detecting rotor imbalance, regardless of the bearing faults. The second pipeline focusses on the bearing faults, regardless of whether the machine is balanced or not. Within the first pipeline, imbalance is detected by differencing the consecutive image frames which are subsequently summarized by their distribution along the image axes. For the second pipeline, three features are introduced which are the standard deviation of the temperature, the Gini coefficient, and the Moment of Light. The final system is able to distinguish between all eight different conditions with an accuracy of 88.25%.}

This study investigates the use of thermal imaging for monitoring water stress. Experiments were conducted on a wine-grape (Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot) vineyard in northern Israel. Irrigation treatments included mild, moderate, and severe stress. Thermal and visible (RGB) images of the crop were taken on four days at midday with a FLIR thermal imaging system and a digital camera, respectively, both mounted on a truck-crane 15 m above the canopy. Aluminium crosses were used to match visible and thermal images in post-processing and an artificial wet surface was used to estimate the reference wet temperature (Twet). Monitored crop parameters included stem water potential (Ψstem), leaf conductance (gL), and leaf area index (LAI). Meteorological parameters were measured at 2 m height. CWSI was highly correlated with gL and moderately correlated with Ψstem. The CWSI-gL relationship was very stable throughout the season, but for that of CWSI-Ψstem both intercept and slope varied considerably. The latter presumably reflects the non-direct nature of the physiological relationship between CWSI and Ψstem. The highest R2 for the CWSI to gL relationship, 0.91 (n=12), was obtained when CWSI was computed using temperatures from the centre of the canopy, Twet from the artificial wet surface, and reference dry temperature from air temperature plus 5 °C. Using Twet calculated from the inverted Penman–Monteith equation and estimated from an artificially wetted part of the canopy also yielded crop water-stress estimates highly correlated with gL (R2=0.89 and 0.82, respectively), while a crop water-stress index using ‘theoretical’ reference temperatures computed from climate data showed significant deviations in the late season. Parameter variability and robustness of the different CWSI estimates are discussed. Future research should aim at developing thermal imaging into an irrigation scheduling tool applicable to different crops.}",

The total variation of the image is minimized subject to constraints involving the statistics of the noise. The constraints are imposed using Lanrange multipliers. The solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold determined by the constraints. As t → ∞ the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the image back onto the constraint set.}

ABSTRACT = {The non-uniform response in infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) detectors inevitably produces corrupted images with a fixed-pattern noise. In this paper, we present a novel and adaptive scene-based non-uniformity correction (NUC) method called Correction method with Statistical scene-based and Interframe Registration (CSIR), which realizes low delay calculation of correction coefficient for infrared image. This method combines the statistical method and registration method to achieve a better NUC performance. Specifically, CSIR estimates the gain coefficient with statistical method to give registration method an appropriate initial value. This combination method not only reduces the need of interactive pictures, which means lower time delay, but also achieves better performance compared to the statistical method and other single registration methods. To verify this, real non-uniformity infrared image sequences collected by ourselves were used, and the advantage of CSIR was compared thoroughly on frame number (corresponding to delay time) and accuracy. The results show that the proposed method could achieve a significantly fast and reliable fixed-pattern noise reduction with the effective gain and offset.},

The proposed method uses an hybrid scheme including an automatic locally-adaptive contrast adjustment and a state-of-the-art image denoising method. It permits to correct for a fully non-linear NU and the noise efficiently using only one image. We compared it with total variation on real raw and simulated NU infrared images. The strength of this approach lies in its simplicity, low computational cost. It needs no test-pattern or calibration and produces no "ghost-artefact".},

@article{Averbuch2007,
   abstract = {Thermal array detectors, also known as focal-plane arrays (FPA), are a rapidly developing technology and are used in a variety of civil, medical and military applications. The detectors, which are sensitive to radiation in the infrared band, output a high resolution low noise thermal picture. The existence of non-uniformities in the responsitivity of the element array is a severe problem typical to FPA. These non-uniformities result in a fixed pattern "curtain"-like feature that appear in the image. One of the most common methods to correct non-uniformity is the use of a uniform reference target. This type of non-uniformity correction has a number of disadvantages. The work presented in this paper proposes a new method to calibrate a thermal detector. The proposed correction method is scene based, relying only on the camera's captured video sequence. The algorithm utilizes redundant information achieved from the thermal camera's high sample rate, combined with the camera's motion. The proposed correction algorithm contains two steps: (1) Application of frame registration that compensates for the camera motion. The registration process matches two consecutive frames and produces a residual (difference) frame. Here, we use well-known techniques. (2) Definition of the calibration parameters as a system of linear equations that is solved with the use of a Kalman filter. The Kalman filter tracks the value of each element specific responsitivity value (unknown) through time. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the success of the proposed scheme. The proposed algorithm necessitates modest computational power (ran on a PC with a Pentium III 550 MHz processor) due to the sparsity of the involved matrices. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Nugent2014,
   abstract = {Advances in microbolometer long-wave infrared (LWIR) detectors have led to the common use of infrared cameras that operate without active temperature stabilization, but the response of these cameras varies with their own temperature. Therefore, obtaining quantitative data requires a calibration that compensates for these errors. This paper describes a method for stabilizing the camera's response through software processing of consecutive images of the scene and images of the camera's internal shutter. An image of the shutter is processed so that it appears as if it were viewed through the lens. The differences between the scene and the image of the shutter treated as an external blackbody are then related to the radiance or temperature of the objects in the scene. This method has been applied to two commercial LWIR cameras over a focal plane array temperature range of ±7.2°C, changing at a rate of up to ±0.5°C/min. During these tests, the rms variability of the camera output was reduced from ±4.0°C to ±0.26°C.},

   abstract = {Midwave infrared systems with cooled detectors are generally used for high-precision or quantitative measurement, such as radiometry and thermometry. As a basis of these applications, radiometric calibration aims to obtain the relationship between the infrared images and the incident radiant flux generated by the scene or targets. Conventional radiometric calibration algorithms do not take the influences of integration and ambient temperature into consideration. As a consequence, the accuracy of calibration deteriorates whenever the temperature or the integration time varies. To solve this problem, we analyzed the effects of integration time and ambient temperature on coefficients of the radiometric calibration formula by theoretical and experimental analysis. Then, a radiometric calibration method is deduced to remove the variation of integration time and ambient temperature on the accuracy of calibration and radiometry. Several radiometric calibration experiments were conducted using a midwave infrared camera inside a chamber with controllable temperature. The results indicate that the proposed calibration algorithm is more effective and accurate, compared with conventional calibration methods, in complicated working conditions with variable integration times and ambient temperatures.},

abstract = {With rapid advancements in infrared focal plane array (IRFPA) technology, greater demands are being placed on nonuniformity correction (NUC) techniques to provide near-BLIP performance over a wide dynamic range. Standard NUC techniques involve calibrating each detector using reference temperature sources before imaging the IRFPA. Usually the correction needs to be re-calibrated after a short period of time due to IRFPA drift or to adjust for changes in the level of background flux. Adaptive NUC techniques eliminate the need for calibration by continuously updating the correction coefficients based on radiance levels of the scene being viewed. In this manner, continuous compensation can be applied adaptively for individual detector non-idealities and background changes. Two adaptive NUC techniques are discussed; one is a temporal highpass filter and the other involves a neural network with lateral interconnects to nearest neighbor pixels. Both have similarities to biological retinal processing. Questions of implementation and stability are discussed and performance results are given for several test image sequences which were obtained from an MWIR HgCdTe array and a HIDAD uncooled array. We conclude that adaptive techniques will be very useful in future IRFPA sensors, primarily because of their ability to adapt over a wide range of background flux without calibration sources, but also because they can offer improved sensitivity under most operating conditions.},

@article{Papini2018,
   abstract = {Low cost, weight, and size microbolometer-based thermal focal plane arrays are attractive for thermal-imaging applications. Under environmental loads like those in agricultural remote sensing, these cameras tend to suffer from drift in gain and offset with time and thus require constant calibration. Our goal is to skip this step via computational imaging. In a previous work we estimated the unknown offset value and radiometric image of an object, given the calibrated gain, from a pair of successive images taken at two different blur levels, eliminating the need for offset calibration due to temperature variation. Here, we extend our model to a case with unknown gain and offset. We show that these values, as well as the objects' radiometric value, can be found jointly by minimizing a cost function relying on N pairs of blurred and sharp images. The method addresses both space-invariant and space-variant cases. Simulations show promising accuracy with error characterized by root mean squared error of less than 1.6 degrees C.},

   abstract = {We introduce DeepIR, a new thermal image processing framework that combines physically accurate sensor modeling with deep network-based image representation. Our key enabling observations are that the images captured by thermal sensors can be factored into slowly changing, scene-independent sensor non-uniformities (that can be accurately modeled using physics) and a scene-specific radiance flux (that is well-represented using a deep network-based regularizer). DeepIR requires neither training data nor periodic ground-truth calibration with a known black body target-making it well suited for practical computer vision tasks. We demonstrate the power of going DeepIR by developing new denoising and super-resolution algorithms that exploit multiple images of the scene captured with camera jitter. Simulated and real data experiments demonstrate that DeepIR can perform high-quality non-uniformity correction with as few as three images, achieving a 10dB PSNR improvement over competing approaches.},

abstract = {Due to low cost and small size, uncooled microbolometer-based thermal focal plane arrays are very attractive for radiometry. However, being non-cooled, they suffer from temporally and spatially dependent changes that require constant calibration. While the gain calibration can be reasonably realized by two-point correction, the offset due to internal radiation loads poses a complicated calibration scheme. We present a new computational optics approach that simplifies the essential calibration for temperature offset. Using two successive images of the object taken with different known blur levels, one can eliminate the object term from the image-formation equation, resulting in an equation for the unknown sensor offset. A general algebraic model is presented for the space-variant case followed by solutions using both direct inverse method and iterative solver. The new scheme allows restoration of the radiometric value within 1\% error with the direct method, and 0.2\% error with the iterative scheme. Account of the influence of realistic lens positioning error on restoration accuracy was given. Results using direct inverse methods for restoring the radiometric values yield restoration error with a good average error of 3.7\% and less.},

@article{He2018,
   abstract = {© 2018 Optical Society of America. Fixed-pattern noise (FPN), which is caused by the nonuniform opto-electronic responses of microbolometer focal-plane-array (FPA) optoelectronics, imposes a challenging problem in infrared imaging systems. In this paper, we successfully demonstrate that a better single-image-based non-uniformity correction (NUC) operator can be directly learned from a large number of simulated training images instead of being handcrafted as before. Our proposed training scheme, which is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a column FPN simulation module, gives rise to a powerful technique to reconstruct the noise-free infrared image from its corresponding noisy observation. Specifically, a comprehensive column FPN model is utilized to depict the nonlinear characteristics of column amplifiers in the readout circuit of FPA. A large number of high-fidelity training images are simulated based on this model and the end-to-end residual deep network is capable of learning the intrinsic difference between undesirable FPN and original image details. Therefore, column FPN can be accurately estimated and further subtracted from the raw infrared images to obtain NUC results. Comparative results with state-of-the-art single-image-based NUC methods, using real-captured noisy infrared images, demonstrate that our proposed deep-learning-based approach delivers better performances of FPN removal, detail preservation, and artifact suppression.},

@article{Jian2018,
   abstract = {The fixed-pattern noise (FPN) caused by nonuniform optoelectronic response limits the sensitivity of an infrared imaging system and severely reduces the image quality. Therefore, nonuniform correction of infrared images is very important. In this paper, we propose a deep filter neural network to solve the problems of network underfitting and complex training with convolutional neural network (CNN) applications in nonuniform correction. Our work is mainly based on the idea of deep learning, where the nonuniform image noise features are fully learned from a large number of simulated training images. The network is designed by introducing the filter and the subtraction structure. The background interference of the image is removed by the filter, so the learning model is gathered in the nonuniform noise. The subtraction structure is used to further reduce the input-to-output mapping range, which effectively simplifies the training process. The results from the test on infrared images shows that our algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithm in visual effects and quantitative measurements, providing a new method for deep learning in nonuniformity correction of single images.},
