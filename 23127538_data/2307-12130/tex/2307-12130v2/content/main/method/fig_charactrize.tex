% Use latex tikz to create a figure:
% The left side of the figure is a rectangle with the word "Simulator" written inside.
% From the generator two arrows exit to the right. The first arrow is connected to four small vertical figures, each containing the figure in path "figs/a.jpeg", above and to the right of the "Simulator" block. The second arrow is connected to four small vertical figures, each containing the figure in path "figs/a.jpeg", under and to the right of the "Simulator" block.
% Add the text "beta *" before each small figure.
% The two groups of four vertical figures will connect to a "sum" operation via arrows. Each group will connect to a separate sum operator.
