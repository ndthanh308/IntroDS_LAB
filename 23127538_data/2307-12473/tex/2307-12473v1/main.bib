ABSTRACT = {For cellular-based vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication, vital information about status and intention is periodically broadcasted by each vehicle using the cooperative awareness message (CAM) service. In C-V2X, the task of resource allocation can either be carried out in a centralized manner by the network, termed Mode 3, or by the vehicles themselves in a distributed manner without any core network support, termed Mode 4. Mode 4 scheduling is accomplished by employing sensing-based semi-persistent scheduling (SB-SPS), where the vehicles sense the medium and identify the best time-frequency resource combination for transmission of the CAM. Focusing on Mode 4 in this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the impact of variations in the transmit power of the vehicle on the performance of SB-SPS for C-V2X communications in various traffic scenarios through simulations. An adaptive-transmit power control (A-TPC) algorithm is presented to improve the quality of service for various large-scale traffic scenarios, where each vehicle uses real-time channel-sensing information to adjust the transmit power in order to avoid interference with neighbouring vehicles. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional TPC schemes.},

abstract = {Abstract In the performance evaluation of a protocol for an ad hoc network, the protocol should be tested under realistic conditions including, but not limited to, a sensible transmission range, limited buffer space for the storage of messages, representative data traffic models and realistic movements of the mobile users (i.e. a mobility model). This paper is a survey of mobility models that are used in the simulations of ad hoc networks. We describe several mobility models that represent mobile nodes whose movements are independent of each other (i.e. entity mobility models) and several mobility models that represent mobile nodes whose movements are dependent on each other (i.e. group mobility models). The goal of this paper is to present a number of mobility models in order to offer researchers more informed choices when they are deciding on a mobility model to use in their performance evaluations. Lastly, we present simulation results that illustrate the importance of choosing a mobility model in the simulation of an ad hoc network protocol. Specifically, we illustrate how the performance results of an ad hoc network protocol drastically change as a result of changing the mobility model simulated.
