abstract = {Abstract The early Earth was marked by at least one global magma ocean. Melt buoyancy played a major role for its evolution. Here we model the composition of the magma ocean using a six-component pyrolite melt, to which we add volatiles in the form of carbon as molecular CO or CO2 and hydrogen as molecular H2O or through substitution for magnesium. We compute the density relations from first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the addition of volatiles renders all the melts more buoyant compared to the reference volatile-free pyrolite. The effect is pressure dependent, largest at the surface, decreasing to about 20 GPa, and remaining roughly constant to 135 GPa. The increased buoyancy would have enhanced convection and turbulence, and thus promoted the chemical exchanges of the magma ocean with the early atmosphere. We determine the partial molar volume of both H2O and CO2 throughout the magma ocean conditions. We find a pronounced dependence with temperature at low pressures, whereas at megabar pressures the partial molar volumes are independent of temperature. At all pressures, the polymerization of the silicate melt is strongly affected by the amount of oxygen added to the system while being only weakly affected by the specific type of volatile added.},

    abstract = { We examine the possible extent of melting in rock-iron super-earths, focusing on those in the habitable zone. We consider the energetics of accretion and core formation, the timescale of cooling and its dependence on viscosity and partial melting, thermal regulation via the temperature dependence of viscosity, and the melting curves of rock and iron components at the ultra-high pressures characteristic of super-earths. We find that the efficiency of kinetic energy deposition during accretion increases with planetary mass; considering the likely role of giant impacts and core formation, we find that super-earths probably complete their accretionary phase in an entirely molten state. Considerations of thermal regulation lead us to propose model temperature profiles of super-earths that are controlled by silicate melting. We estimate melting curves of iron and rock components up to the extreme pressures characteristic of super-earth interiors based on existing experimental and ab initio results and scaling laws. We construct super-earth thermal models by solving the equations of mass conservation and hydrostatic equilibrium, together with equations of state of rock and iron components. We set the potential temperature at the core–mantle boundary and at the surface to the local silicate melting temperature. We find that ancient (∼4 Gyr) super-earths may be partially molten at the top and bottom of their mantles, and that mantle convection is sufficiently vigorous to sustain dynamo action over the whole range of super-earth masses. }

To facilitate the inclusion of water in melting models this paper presents a new parameterization for melt fraction as a function of pressure, temperature, water content and modal cpx, based on knowledge gained from recent advances in the fields of thermodynamic modeling as well as experimental investigations of peridotite melting and hydrous equilibria. The parameterization is computationally efficient and can be modified easily as better experimental data become available. We compare it to other published parameterizations and test it in simple calculations of adiabatic decompression melting (mid-ocean ridge) and hydrous melting (subduction zone).},

abstract = {A review of experiments on natural peridotites allows improved constraints on the location of the mantle solidus. Available constraints on the location of the nominally dry peridotite solidus show considerable scatter, owing to interlaboratory uncertainties and the effects of bulk composition. When experiments on enriched peridotite are filtered from the database, the best fit to the solidus between 0 and 10 GPa is given by T(°C) = aP2 + bP + c where a = −5.104, b = 132.899, and c = 1120.661 and P is in gigapascals. Compared to previous models, the solidus in this parameterization is at lower temperature between 2 and 6 GPa, with the largest differences near 4 GPa, where it is 30°–60°C cooler. Consideration of experimental constraints on the peridotite solidus and of a theoretical model of melting in a simple analogue system suggests that a key variable affecting peridotite solidus temperature is the near-solidus liquid alkali concentration. The effect of alkalis on the solidus increases with bulk concentration in the peridotite but decreases with bulk partition coefficient. Thus small bulk concentrations of K can have a significant influence on the peridotite solidus, and the effect of Na diminishes with increasing pressure, as it becomes more compatible in the solidus residua. Mg \# [=100 × MgO/(MgO + FeO)] variations are subordinate to alkali variations in controlling solidus temperature at lower pressures but may increase in relative importance as alkalis become more compatible in peridotite residua with increasing pressure. Increased clinopyroxene mode has the effect of making Na more compatible in residual solids and so diminishes the solidus-lowering tendencies of alkalis. As a consequence, experiments performed on a range of peridotite compositions may not reflect the likely effect of variable mantle composition on solidus temperature if they do not match the appropriate correlation between alkali content and clinopyroxene mode.},

abstract = {Geodynamic models commonly assume equations of state as a function of pressure and temperature. This form is legitimate for homogenous materials, but it is impossible to formulate a general equation of state for a polyphase aggregate, e.g., a rock, as a function of pressure and temperature because these variables cannot distinguish all possible states of the aggregate. In consequence, the governing equations of a geodynamic model based on a pressure-temperature equation of state are singular at the conditions of low-order phase transformations. An equation of state as a function of specific entropy, specific volume, and chemical composition eliminates this difficulty and, additionally, leads to a robust formulation of the energy and mass conservation equations. In this formulation, energy and mass conservation furnish evolution equations for entropy and volume and the equation of state serves as an update rule for temperature and pressure. Although this formulation is straightforward, the computation of phase equilibria as a function of entropy and volume is challenging because the equations of state for individual phases are usually expressed as a function of temperature and pressure. This challenge can be met by an algorithm in which continuous equations of state are approximated by a series of discrete states: a representation that reduces the phase equilibrium problem to a linear optimization problem that is independent of the functional form used for the equations of state of individual phases. Because the efficiency of the optimization decays as an exponential function of the dimension of the function to be optimized, direct solution of the linearized optimization problem is impractical. Successive linear programming alleviates this difficulty. A pragmatic alternative to optimization as an explicit function of entropy and volume is to calculate phase relations over the range of pressure-temperature conditions of interest. Numerical interpolation can then be used to generate tables for any thermodynamic property as a function of any choice of independent variables. Regardless of the independent variables of the governing equations, a consistent definition of pressure, and the coupling of equilibrium kinetics to deformation, is only possible if the continuity equation accounts for dilational strain.},

A parameterization of the Grüneisen parameter γ as a function of density ρ and specific internal energy E is γ = γ0 + γ′(ρ/ρ0)n(E - E0) where γ0 = 1.735, γ′ = −0.130 kg/MJ, n = −1.87, and E0 is the internal energy of the liquid at 1 bar and 1811 K. The model gives the temperature dependence of γ at constant volume as (∂γ/∂T)v|1bar,1811K = −8.4 × 10−5 K−1. The constant volume specific heat of liquid Fe at core conditions is 4.0–4.5 R. The model gives excellent agreement with measured temperatures of Fe under shock compression. Comparison with a preliminary reference Earth model indicates that the light component of the core does not significantly affect the magnitude of the isentropic bulk modulus of liquid Fe but does decrease its pressure derivative by ∼10\%. Pure liquid Fe is 3–6\% more dense than the inner core, supporting the presence of several percent of light elements in the inner core.},

Because anharmonicity can be significant at the high temperatures associated with melting, leading order anharmonic contributions to the mean-square atomic vibrations have been included in the present lattice dynamical formulation of the Lindemann criterion. The parameters required in this Lindemann expression can be determined from an inversion of thermodynamic data so that a direct comparison with experimental melting data can be made without resort to model potentials. In general, we find that although atomic vibrations can be significantly anharmonic near the melting point, the shape of the melting curve predicted from the Lindemann criterion is not much influenced by anharmonicity. We demonstrate that the Lindemann expression is inconsistent with experimental melting data for a variety of substances, particularly at low pressures. In some cases (argon, sodium chloride and potassium chloride), the melting slopes observed at high pressures are consistent with a Lindemann expression. In general, we find that a Lindemann criterion is not an adequate description of the melting behavior of minerals. Therefore, an application of the Lindemann law to obtain the melting temperatures of minerals at high pressures, and to determine the fusion curve of the earth's deep interior is, at present, speculative.},

abstract = {Compositional models of the Earth are critically dependent on three main sources of information: the seismic profile of the Earth and its interpretation, comparisons between primitive meteorites and the solar nebula composition, and chemical and petrological models of peridotite-basalt melting relationships. Whereas a family of compositional models for the Earth are permissible based on these methods, the model that is most consistent with the seismological and geodynamic structure of the Earth comprises an upper and lower mantle of similar composition, an FeNi core having between 5% and 15% of a low-atomic-weight element, and a mantle which, when compared to CI carbonaceous chondrites, is depleted in Mg and Si relative to the refractory lithophile elements. The absolute and relative abundances of the refractory elements in carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondritic meteorites are compared. The bulk composition of an average CI carbonaceous chondrite is defined from previous compilations and from the refractory element compositions of different groups of chondrites. The absolute uncertainties in their refractory element compositions are evaluated by comparing ratios of these elements. These data are then used to evaluate existing models of the composition of the Silicate Earth. The systematic behavior of major and trace elements during differentiation of the mantle is used to constrain the Silicate Earth composition. Seemingly fertile peridotites have experienced a previous melting event that must be accounted for when developing these models. The approach taken here avoids unnecessary assumptions inherent in several existing models, and results in an internally consistent Silicate Earth composition having chondritic proportions of the refractory lithophile elements at ∼ 2.75 times that in CI carbonaceous chondrites. Element ratios in peridotites, komatiites, basalts and various crustal rocks are used to assess the abundances of both non-lithophile and non-refractory elements in the Silicate Earth. These data provide insights into the accretion processes of the Earth, the chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle, the effect of core formation, and indicate negligible exchange between the core and mantle throughout the geologic record (the last 3.5 Ga). The composition of the Earth's core is poorly constrained beyond its major constituents (i.e. an FeNi alloy). Density contrasts between the inner and outer core boundary are used to suggest the presence (∼ 10 ± 5%) of a light element or a combination of elements (e.g., O, S, Si) in the outer core. The core is the dominant repository of siderophile elements in the Earth. The limits of our understanding of the core's composition (including the light-element component) depend on models of core formation and the class of chondritic meteorites we have chosen when constructing models of the bulk Earth's composition. The Earth has a bulk FeAl of ∼ 20 ± 2, established by assuming that the Earth's budget of Al is stored entirely within the Silicate Earth and Fe is partitioned between the Silicate Earth (∼ 14%) and the core (∼ 86%). Chondritic meteorites display a range of FeAl ratios, with many having a value close to 20. A comparison of the bulk composition of the Earth and chondritic meteorites reveals both similarities and differences, with the Earth being more strongly depleted in the more volatile elements. There is no group of meteorites that has a bulk composition matching that of the Earth's.}

abstract = {The boundary between Earth's core and mantle defines where the iron-rich liquid outer core meets the more chemically heterogeneous solid lower mantle and is marked by a sharp thermal gradient of nearly 1500 kelvin. The precise relationship between temperature and melting of the lowermost mantle constrains the structure and heat flow across the core-mantle boundary. In order to identify trace amounts of liquid as melting initiates, Nomura et al. (p. 522, published online 16 January) performed x-ray microtomographic imaging of rocks of a primitive mantle composition that had been subjected to high pressures and temperatures in a diamond anvil cell. The experimentally determined maximum melting point of 3570 kelvin suggests that some phases typically thought to lose stability in the lowermost mantle, such as MgSiO3-rich post-perovskite, may be more widely distributed than expected. High-pressure experiments suggest that Earth’s mantle melts at lower temperatures than previously predicted. The melting temperature of Earth’s mantle provides key constraints on the thermal structures of both the mantle and the core. Through high-pressure experiments and three-dimensional x-ray microtomographic imaging, we showed that the solidus temperature of a primitive (pyrolitic) mantle is as low as 3570 ± 200 kelvin at pressures expected near the boundary between the mantle and the outer core. Because the lowermost mantle is not globally molten, this provides an upper bound of the temperature at the core-mantle boundary (TCMB). Such remarkably low TCMB implies that the post-perovskite phase is present in wide areas of the lowermost mantle. The low TCMB also requires that the melting temperature of the outer core is depressed largely by impurities such as hydrogen.}}

The apparent ubiquity of melting during giant accretionary impacts suggests that silicate and metallic material may be processed through multiple magma oceans before reaching solidity in a planet. The processes of magma ocean formation and solidification, therefore, strongly influence the earliest compositional differentiation and volatile content of the terrestrial planets, and they form the starting point for cooling to clement, habitable conditions and for the onset of thermally driven mantle convection and plate tectonics. This review focuses on evidence for magma oceans on planetesimals and planets and on research concerning the processes of compositional differentiation in the silicate magma ocean, distribution and degassing of volatiles, and cooling. }

The simulated results for the partial radial distribution function all compare well with experiment. The calculated equation of state is very successful in accurately reproducing the recent experimental data over a wide pressure range. The predicted high pressure melting curve is in good agreement with the experimental ones, and the melting curve up to the core–mantle boundary pressure, being very steep at lower pressures, rapidly flattens on increasing pressure. The present results also suggest the validity of the experimental data of Zerr and Boehler.}

Partial melts segregate and migrate into the pore space between diamond grains soon after their formation. Overgrowth of minerals at quenching modifies the composition of coexisting melt, but this modification does not extend to the trapped melt in the diamond layer. Microprobe analyses of the trapped melt, therefore, can determine the melt compositions without the quench problem. Melts formed by low degrees of partial melting ( ∼ 5%) can be analyzed successfully by this method. The effect of the source composition on partial melting was examined for the two different lherzolites. Both partial melts have nearly the same SiO2 and MgO contents at the same pressure and temperature conditions regardless of their different Mg/(Mg + Fe) ratios, suggesting that SiO2 and MgO contents in partial melts depend little on the source composition. In contrast, FeO, Al2O3, CaO and incompatible elements are controlled by the composition of the source peridotite as well as by the degree of partial melting. In the normative projections, the differences in the lherzolite compositions do not significantly shift the isobaric compositional trends of the partial melts.}

It was found that the solidus comprises three curves corresponding to subsolidus mineral assemblages with cusps at about 11 and 26 kbar. In order to determine the composition of melt coexisting with peridotite, a thin layer of basalt was sandwiched between compressed blocks of powdered peridotite minerals and then was equilibrated with its host at melting temperatures. A time study at 15 kbar and 1300°C (25°C above the solidus) showed that the basalt melt embedded in the peridotite was completely homogenized with the partial melt in the peridotite matrix within 24 hours. The composition of melt formed along the solidus of the peridotite is a quartz tholeiite at 5 kbar, an olivine tholeiite similar to mid-ocean ridge basalt (morb) at 8 and 10 kbar, an alkali-olivine basalt between 15 and 20 kbar, and an alkali picrite above 25 kbar. The role of K2O in the melting was specifically investigated by adding 20 wt.\\% potassium feldspar to the starting peridotite. The solidus of the K-rich peridotite is 70° and 150°C lower than that of the original peridotite at 20 and 30 kbar, respectively. Its extension may intersect with the normal oceanic geotherm at a pressure between 30 and 50 kbar. The melts are leucite phonolitic at the solidus of the K-rich peridotite and change gradually to the composition of the alkali picrite at the solidus of the original peridotite. A hypothesis of shallow depth origin for morbs is supported by the fact that the composition of melt formed near the solidus at 8 kbar (16 wt.\\% Al2O3, 11 wt.\\% CaO, 9 wt.\\% MgO) plots in the middle of the morb’s cluster in the normative projections. The olivine-liquid Fe/Mg partition coefficient, KD = (Fe/Mg)ol/(Fe/Mg)liq is given by KD = 0.30 + 0.002 P (kbar) in the pressure range 1 atm to 35 kbar. Judging from the KD values, most previously reported glass compositions in peridotite melting experiments are significantly modified by the overgrowth effect of residual solids.}",

abstract = {Dike intrusions are often accompanied by localized deflation, interpreted as depressurizing magma chambers feeding the dike. In some cases the inferred volume decrease is a factor of 4 or 5 less than the volume increase of the dike. Here we explore whether this discrepancy can be explained by compressibility of the magma combined with the fact that cracks are much more compliant than equidimensional magma chambers. If pressure changes are small, the magma compressibility βm is constant, and the dike ends up in hydrostatic equilibrium with an ellipsoidal magma chamber at the same depth, the ratio rV of the volume of the crack to the volume lost by the chamber is rV = 1 + 4μβm/3 > 1, where μ is the host rock rigidity. For gas poor magmas, βm = 0.6–2 · 10−10 Pa−1 and μ = 3–25 GPa, we find 1.2 < rV < 7.7. Large changes in magma compressibility due to gas exsolution increase rV.},

    abstract = "{Melt generation and migration are an important link between surface processes and the thermal and chemical evolution of the Earth's interior. However, their vastly different timescales make it difficult to study mantle convection and melt migration in a unified framework, especially for 3-D global models. And although experiments suggest an increase in melt volume of up to 20 per cent from the depth of melt generation to the surface, previous computations have neglected the individual compressibilities of the solid and the fluid phase. Here, we describe our extension of the finite element mantle convection code ASPECT that adds melt generation and migration. We use the original compressible formulation of the McKenzie equations, augmented by an equation for the conservation of energy. Applying adaptive mesh refinement to this type of problems is particularly advantageous, as the resolution can be increased in areas where melt is present and viscosity gradients are high, whereas a lower resolution is sufficient in regions without melt. Together with a high-performance, massively parallel implementation, this allows for high-resolution, 3-D, compressible, global mantle convection simulations coupled with melt migration. We evaluate the functionality and potential of this method using a series of benchmarks and model setups, compare results of the compressible and incompressible formulation, and show the effectiveness of adaptive mesh refinement when applied to melt migration. Our model of magma dynamics provides a framework for modelling processes on different scales and investigating links between processes occurring in the deep mantle and melt generation and migration. This approach could prove particularly useful applied to modelling the generation of komatiites or other melts originating in greater depths. The implementation is available in the Open Source ASPECT repository.}",

abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.}

abstract = {The search for rocky exoplanets plays an important role in our quest for extra-terrestrial life. Here, we discuss the extreme physical properties possible for the first characterised rocky super-Earth, CoRoT-7b (Rpl=1.58±0.10REarth, Mpl=6.9±1.2MEarth). It is extremely close to its star (a=0.0171AU=4.48Rst), with its spin and orbital rotation likely synchronised. The comparison of its location in the (Mpl,Rpl) plane with the predictions of planetary models for different compositions points to an Earth-like composition, even if the error bars of the measured quantities and the partial degeneracy of the models prevent a definitive conclusion. The proximity to its star provides an additional constraint on the model. It implies a high extreme-UV flux and particle wind, and the corresponding efficient erosion of the planetary atmosphere especially for volatile species including water. Consequently, we make the working hypothesis that the planet is rocky with no volatiles in its atmosphere, and derive the physical properties that result. As a consequence, the atmosphere is made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure (P⩽1.5Pa), no cloud can be sustained, and no thermalisation of the planet is expected. The dayside is very hot (2474±71K at the sub-stellar point) while the nightside is very cold (50–75K). The sub-stellar point is as hot as the tungsten filament of an incandescent bulb, resulting in the melting and distillation of silicate rocks and the formation of a lava ocean. These possible features of CoRoT-7b could be common to many small and hot planets, including the recently discovered Kepler-10b. They define a new class of objects that we propose to name “Lava-ocean planets”.}

abstract = {We review our understanding of the exsolved volatile phase co-existing with magmas during pre-eruptive storage at the pressures and temperatures corresponding to crustal magma reservoirs. We explore the consequences and implications of such a volatile phase for magma and ore body petrogenesis and the fluid dynamics of magma reservoirs. We outline the geochemical constraints on the size and composition of the exsolved volatile phase that may co-exist with magmas in the crust. We distinguish between decompression-driven and crystallization-driven exsolution, and describe the implications of the volatiles for the dynamics of the magma reservoir, using key natural examples and case studies. We discuss eruptions triggered by second boiling, and the various regimes of magma mixing and magma overturn that may be induced by second boiling in a layered reservoir. We also explore the control of the volatile content of the magma on the mass erupted during an eruption episode, and compare our models to eruption datasets. We then turn to the mechanisms for magma-volatile separation, noting that in crystal-poor melts convective separation of exsolved volatiles may dominate while in crystal-rich melts, volatiles may generate channels or permeable-flow pathways through the crystal mush, thereby separating from the parent magma. We discuss the implications of the accumulation of the exsolved volatile phase at the roof zones of crystal-rich reservoirs for the large gas emissions observed during explosive eruptions, and for the development of metal-rich porphyry deposits.}

abstract = {It has been argued that the crystallization of the magma ocean (MO) after the Moon-forming impact led to the formation of a basal magma ocean (BMO). We search which primordial conditions of pressure, temperature and chemical composition could be compatible with such scenario, based on thermodynamical constraints. The major requirement is an early formation of a viscous layer (VL) of mantle material (i.e. bridgmanite (Bg)) at mid lower-mantle depth, which could insulate thermally and chemically the BMO from the rest of the mantle. To produce such VL, Bg grains should be: (i) neutrally buoyant at mid lower-mantle depths, (ii) sufficiently abundant to produce an efficient insulating layer, and (iii) aggregated to the boundary layer from above and below. The first and the second require a large amount of MO crystallization, up to more than 45%, even in the most favorable case of all Fe partitioning into the melt. The latter is very questionable because the Bg grains have a very small settling velocity. We also investigate different scenarios of MO crystallization to provide constraints on the resulting core temperature. Starting from a fully molten Earth, a temperature as high as ∼4725K could be found at the core–mantle boundary (CMB), if the Bg grains settle early atop the CMB. Such a basal layer of Bg can efficiently decouple from each other the cooling rates of the core and the mantle above the VL. If the settling velocity of Bg grains is too low and/or the MO is too turbulent, such basal VL may not form. In this case, the CMB temperature after MO solidification should stabilize at ∼4350K. At this temperature, enough Bg grains are crystallized to make the mushy mantle viscous at any mantle depth.}

abstract = {Melting properties of the deep mantle remain controversial due to experimental difficulties; e.g., reports of solidus temperatures of mantle-relevant compositions span over ∼700 K at 2000 km depth. This situation limits our understanding of the thermochemical state of the Earth's interior. Using the laser heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC), we performed new experimental determination of the solidus profile of ultra-dry pyrolite and the solidus of two compositions of (Mg,Fe)(Si,Al)O3 bridgmanite (Bg). Melting was detected (i) from -the correlation between laser power and sample temperature, -changes of sample texture and -the level of visible light absorption, for all samples, (ii) using X-ray diffraction, for the MgSiO3 composition and (iii) after scanning electron microscope observations, for selected Fe-bearing samples. Special care was given to using ultra-dry experimental chambers and to determination of sample temperature. In particular, we discuss the wavelength-dependent thermal emission of silicate samples, which lowers the solidus by 100 to 300 K, compared to the grey-body assumption. The solidus of MgSiO3-Bg is in good agreement with previous reports using ab initio calculations and shock wave experiments. We observe a net decrease in the solid-liquid Clapeyron slope at 60(3) GPa and 4400(200) K, which can be related to rapid pressure-induced coordination change of Si in the melt. (Mg0.955,Fe0.045)(Si0.993,Al0.007)O3 Bg melts 600–800 K lower than MgSiO3-Bg. Its solidus evolves smoothly with pressure, suggesting progressive Si coordination change in the melt. In the pressure range investigated (24–135 GPa) Clapeyron slopes suggest rapid decrease of the volume of fusion, from 14 to 2% for MgSiO3 and from 9 to 3% for (Fe,Al)-bearing Bg, assuming congruent melting. By comparing the solidii of various silicates, it appears that the higher the number of cations, the less pronounced is the curvature of the solidus. This observation suggests that the relatively ordered structure of simple liquid compositions with a limited number of distinct network-modifying cations frustrates the coexistence of tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated Si polyhedral. The solidus of pyrolite presents a smooth evolution from 2200(100) K to 3950(200) K in the same pressure interval. This is very similar to our previous work on chondritic-type mantle. The new solidus is 200–300 K lower than that of KLB-1 peridotite, which can be related to more incompatible elements in pyrolite. It remains problematic that our solidus plots several 100 K higher than other recent measurements performed on pyrolite; we discuss the possibility of a higher water content in previous samples, compared to our experiments. Assuming a dry lowermost mantle, our results imply a core-mantle boundary temperature lower than 3950(200) K. Modeling the melting diagram at the core-mantle boundary suggests a pseudo-eutectic melt significantly depleted in SiO2, compared to the composition of the mean mantle.}
