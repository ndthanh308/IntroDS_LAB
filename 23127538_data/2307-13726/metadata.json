  "abstract": "Lava worlds are a potential emerging population of Super-Earths that are on close-in orbits around their host stars with likely partially molten mantles. To date, few studies address the impact of magma on the observed properties of a planet. At ambient conditions magma is less dense than solid rock; however, it is also more compressible with increasing pressure. Therefore, it is unclear how large-scale magma oceans affect planet observables, such as bulk density. We update ExoPlex, a thermodynamically self-consistent planet interior software, to include anhydrous, hydrous (2.2 wt \\% H_2O), and carbonated magmas (5.2 wt\\% CO_2). We find that Earth-like planets with magma oceans larger than \\sim 1.5 R_{\\oplus} and \\sim 3.2 M_{\\oplus} are modestly denser than an equivalent mass solid planet. From our model, three classes of mantle structures emerge for magma ocean planets: (1) mantle magma ocean, (2) surface magma ocean, and (3) one consisting of a surface magma ocean, solid rock layer, and a basal magma ocean. The class of planets in which a basal magma ocean is present may sequester dissolved volatiles on billion-year timescales, in which a 4 M_{\\oplus} mass planet can trap more than 130 times the mass of water than in Earth's present-day oceans and 1000 times the carbon in the Earth's surface and crust.",
