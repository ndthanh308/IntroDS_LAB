Using a Peierls argument we obtain a rigorous bound on the transition temperature, thereby disproving a conjecture on the location of its critical point. Low-temperature series are generated and analyzed for three particular choices of the coupling constants; a phase diagram is then drawn on the basis of these considerations. Our analysis indicates that the antiferromagnetic transition and the transition along the coexistence line are of first order, implying the existence of a multicritical point in the ferromagnetic region. Relation of the triangularq-state Potts model with other lattice-statistical problems is also discussed. In particular, an Ashkin-Teller model and the hard-hexagon lattice gas solved by Baxter emerge as special cases in appropriate limits.},

abstract = {The new computer program {\it SHELXT} employs a novel dual-space algorithm to solve the phase problem for single-crystal reflection data expanded to the space group {\it P}1. Missing data are taken into account and the resolution extended if necessary. All space groups in the specified Laue group are tested to find which are consistent with the {\it P}1 phases. After applying the resulting origin shifts and space-group symmetry, the solutions are subject to further dual-space recycling followed by a peak search and summation of the electron density around each peak. Elements are assigned to give the best fit to the integrated peak densities and if necessary additional elements are considered. An isotropic refinement is followed for non-centrosymmetric space groups by the calculation of a Flack parameter and, if appropriate, inversion of the structure. The structure is assembled to maximize its connectivity and centred optimally in the unit cell. {\it SHELXT} has already solved many thousand structures with a high success rate, and is optimized for multiprocessor computers. It is, however, unsuitable for severely disordered and twinned structures because it is based on the assumption that the structure consists of atoms.},

abstract={Owing to the unusual geometry of kagome lattices---lattices made of corner-sharing triangles---their electrons are useful for studying the physics of frustrated, correlated and topological quantum electronic states1--9. In the presence of strong spin--orbit coupling, the magnetic and electronic structures of kagome lattices are further entangled, which can lead to hitherto unknown spin--orbit phenomena. Here we use a combination of vector-magnetic-field capability and scanning tunnelling microscopy to elucidate the spin--orbit nature of the kagome ferromagnet Fe3Sn2 and explore the associated exotic correlated phenomena. We discover that a many-body electronic state from the kagome lattice couples strongly to the vector field with three-dimensional anisotropy, exhibiting a magnetization-driven giant nematic (two-fold-symmetric) energy shift. Probing the fermionic quasi-particle interference reveals consistent spontaneous nematicity---a clear indication of electron correlation---and vector magnetization is capable of altering this state, thus controlling the many-body electronic symmetry. These spin-driven giant electronic responses go well beyond Zeeman physics and point to the realization of an underlying correlated magnetic topological phase. The tunability of this kagome magnet reveals a strong interplay between an externally applied field, electronic excitations and nematicity, providing new ways of controlling spin--orbit properties and exploring emergent phenomena in topological or quantum materials10--12.},

	abstract = {The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is one of the most fundamental phenomena in physics. In the highly conductive regime, ferromagnetic metals have been the focus of past research. Here, we report a giant extrinsic AHE in KV3Sb5, an exfoliable, highly conductive semimetal with Dirac quasiparticles and a vanadium Kagome net. Even without report of long range magnetic order, the anomalous Hall conductivity reaches 15,507 Ω-1 cm-1 with an anomalous Hall ratio of ≈ 1.8\%; an order of magnitude larger than Fe. Defying theoretical expectations, KV3Sb5 shows enhanced skew scattering that scales quadratically, not linearly, with the longitudinal conductivity, possibly arising from the combination of highly conductive Dirac quasiparticles with a frustrated magnetic sublattice. This allows the possibility of reaching an anomalous Hall angle of 90{\textdegree} in metals. This observation raises fundamental questions about AHEs and opens new frontiers for AHE and spin Hall effect exploration, particularly in metallic frustrated magnets.}

Bulk–surface correspondence in Weyl semimetals ensures the formation of topological “Fermi arc” surface bands whose existence is guaranteed by bulk Weyl nodes. By investigating three distinct surface terminations of the ferromagnetic semimetal Co3Sn2S2, we verify spectroscopically its classification as a time-reversal symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal. We show that the distinct surface potentials imposed by three different terminations modify the Fermi-arc contour and Weyl node connectivity. On the tin (Sn) surface, we identify intra–Brillouin zone Weyl node connectivity of Fermi arcs, whereas on cobalt (Co) termination, the connectivity is across adjacent Brillouin zones. On the sulfur (S) surface, Fermi arcs overlap with nontopological bulk and surface states. We thus resolve both topologically protected and nonprotected electronic properties of a Weyl semimetal.}

abstract={Electrical manipulation of phenomena generated by nontrivial band topology is essential for the development of next-generation technology using topological protection. A Weyl semimetal is a three-dimensional gapless system that hosts Weyl fermions as low-energy quasiparticles1--4. It has various exotic properties, such as a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and chiral anomaly, which are robust owing to the topologically protected Weyl nodes1--16. To manipulate such phenomena, a magnetic version of Weyl semimetals would be useful for controlling the locations of Weyl nodes in the Brillouin zone. Moreover, electrical manipulation of antiferromagnetic Weyl metals would facilitate the use of antiferromagnetic spintronics to realize high-density devices with ultrafast operation17,18. However, electrical control of a Weyl metal has not yet been reported. Here we demonstrate the electrical switching of a topological antiferromagnetic state and its detection by the AHE at room temperature in a polycrystalline thin film19 of the antiferromagnetic Weyl metal Mn3Sn9,10,12,20, which exhibits zero-field AHE. Using bilayer devices composed of Mn3Sn and nonmagnetic metals, we find that an electrical current density of about 1010 to 1011 amperes per square metre induces magnetic switching in the nonmagnetic metals, with a large change in Hall voltage. In addition, the current polarity along the bias field and the sign of the spin Hall angle of the nonmagnetic metals---positive for Pt (ref. 21), close to 0 for Cu and negative for W (ref. 22)---determines the sign of the Hall voltage. Notably, the electrical switching in the antiferromagnet is achieved with the same protocol as that used for ferromagnetic metals23,24. Our results may lead to further scientific and technological advances in topological magnetism and antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

While the magnetism of Fe3Sn2 appears to be relatively simple at high temperature, with localized moments parallel to the c-axis (TC = 640 K), upon cooling the competing exchange interactions and spin frustration become apparent as they cause the moments to become non-collinear and to rotate towards the kagome plane, forming firstly a canted ferromagnetic structure and then a re-entrant spin glass ( K)}}.

	abstract = {We report the discovery of superconductivity and detailed normal-state physical properties of RbV3Sb5 single crystals with V kagome lattice. RbV3Sb5 single crystals show a superconducting transition at T c ∼ 0.92 K. Meanwhile, resistivity, magnetization and heat capacity measurements indicate that it exhibits anomalies of properties at T * ∼ 102–103 K, possibly related to the formation of charge ordering state. When T is lower than T *, the Hall coefficient R H undergoes a drastic change and sign reversal from negative to positive, which can be partially explained by the enhanced mobility of hole-type carriers. In addition, the results of quantum oscillations show that there are some very small Fermi surfaces with low effective mass, consistent with the existence of multiple highly dispersive Dirac band near the Fermi energy level.}

ABSTRACT = {RV6Sn6 (R = Sc, Y, or rare earth) is a new family of kagome metals that have a similar vanadium structural motif as AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) compounds. Unlike AV3Sb5, ScV6Sn6 is the only compound among the series of RV6Sn6 that displays a charge density wave (CDW) order at ambient pressure, yet it shows no superconductivity (SC) at low temperatures. Here, we perform a high-pressure transport study on the ScV6Sn6 single crystal to track the evolutions of the CDW transition and to explore possible SC. In contrast to AV3Sb5 compounds, the CDW order of ScV6Sn6 can be suppressed completely by a pressure of about 2.4 GPa, but no SC is detected down to 40 mK at 2.35 GPa and 1.5 K up to 11 GPa. Moreover, we observed that the resistivity anomaly around the CDW transition undergoes an obvious change at ~2.04 GPa before it vanishes completely. The present work highlights a distinct relationship between CDW and SC in ScV6Sn6 in comparison with the well-studied AV3Sb5.},

ABSTRACT = {RV6Sn6 (R = Sc, Y, or rare earth) is a new family of kagome metals that have a similar vanadium structural motif as AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) compounds. Unlike AV3Sb5, ScV6Sn6 is the only compound among the series of RV6Sn6 that displays a charge density wave (CDW) order at ambient pressure, yet it shows no superconductivity (SC) at low temperatures. Here, we perform a high-pressure transport study on the ScV6Sn6 single crystal to track the evolutions of the CDW transition and to explore possible SC. In contrast to AV3Sb5 compounds, the CDW order of ScV6Sn6 can be suppressed completely by a pressure of about 2.4 GPa, but no SC is detected down to 40 mK at 2.35 GPa and 1.5 K up to 11 GPa. Moreover, we observed that the resistivity anomaly around the CDW transition undergoes an obvious change at ~2.04 GPa before it vanishes completely. The present work highlights a distinct relationship between CDW and SC in ScV6Sn6 in comparison with the well-studied AV3Sb5.},
