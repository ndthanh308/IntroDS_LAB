\section{Design Challenges}
\label{sec:discuss}

Our theoretical and empirical analyses indicate that, to improve their stability, stablecoin systems need to implement a robust incentive protocol, offer higher redemption payments when the asset to be used for a payment depreciates, or utilize more stable assets to back their coins. However, these measures may introduce other challenges.

Firstly, implementing a robust and popular incentive protocol can incentivize users to retain their stablecoins even during price declines. However, this approach can necessitate a substantial budget for providing sufficient monetary incentives to users. This issue has been highlighted in the case of Anchor, the popular incentive mechanism of Terra, where concerns about sustainability arose. Consequently, the design of incentive protocols becomes a crucial consideration. Developers may also explore non-monetary incentives, such as social reputation, as an alternative approach. However, it remains to be seen whether non-monetary incentives will be as effective as monetary incentives in this context.

Second, paying a higher value to users who redeem coins can reduce the difference between users' recognized value and the value intended by the system, even if the price of the asset, which is a payment medium, drops. This brings about a similar problem as the first solution because systems should possess more reserves to pay users with a higher value. 

Lastly, backing stablecoins with stable assets mitigates the impact of adverse economic conditions. Systems can achieve this by considering off-chain assets or other stablecoins, which is a common practice among many systems. However, this approach introduces certain challenges, such as centralization issues similar to those experienced by Tether, or reliance on other systems. Relying on other systems can potentially lead to a cascading risk. For instance, in March of this year, a bank run on Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) caused a ripple effect, leading to the depegging of several major stablecoins~\cite{svb}. Several stablecoins such as DAI depending on USDC have consequently been affected by a depeg of USDC that held a significant portion of its reserves in SVB. 

The challenges associated with stablecoin designs highlight the difficulty of completely eliminating risks. As a result, it becomes essential to focus on effectively managing risks and exploring optimal risk management strategies. By continuing to advance our understanding of stablecoin dynamics, we can work towards creating more robust and secure systems for the future.
