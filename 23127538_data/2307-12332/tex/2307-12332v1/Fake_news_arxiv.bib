These are common scenarios in today{'}s time and websites react by shutting down their comment sections. To tackle this, an algorithmic solution is preferred to human moderation which is slow and expensive. In this paper, we propose a single model capsule network with focal loss to achieve this task which is suitable for production environment. Our model achieves competitive results over other strong baseline methods, which show its effectiveness and that focal loss exhibits significant improvement in such cases where class imbalance is a regular issue. Additionally, we show that the problem of extensive data preprocessing, data augmentation can be tackled by capsule networks implicitly. We achieve an overall ROC AUC of 98.46 on Kaggle-toxic comment dataset and show that it beats other architectures by a good margin. As comments tend to be written in more than one language, and transliteration is a common problem, we further show that our model handles this effectively by applying our model on TRAC shared task dataset which contains comments in code-mixed Hindi-English."

In this paper we apply and compare simple shallow capsule networks for hierarchical multi-label text classification and show that they can perform superior to other neural networks, such as CNNs and LSTMs, and non-neural network architectures such as SVMs. For our experiments, we use the established Web of Science (WOS) dataset and introduce a new real-world scenario dataset, the BlurbGenreCollection (BGC). Our results confirm the hypothesis that capsule networks are especially advantageous for rare events and structurally diverse categories, which we attribute to their ability to combine latent encoded information."

We propose three strategies to stabilize the dynamic routing process to alleviate the disturbance of some noise capsules which may contain {``}background{''} information or have not been successfully trained. A series of experiments are conducted with capsule networks on six text classification benchmarks. Capsule networks achieve state of the art on 4 out of 6 datasets, which shows the effectiveness of capsule networks for text classification. We additionally show that capsule networks exhibit significant improvement when transfer single-label to multi-label text classification over strong baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that capsule networks have been empirically investigated for text modeling."

abstract = {As the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has run rampant worldwide, the dissemination of misinformation has sown confusion on a global scale. Thus, understanding the propagation of fake news and implementing countermeasures has become exceedingly important to the well-being of society. To assist this cause, we produce a valuable dataset called FibVID (Fake news information-broadcasting dataset of COVID-19), which addresses COVID-19 and non-COVID news from three key angles. First, we provide truth and falsehood (T/F) indicators of news items, as labeled and validated by several fact-checking platforms (e.g., Snopes and Politifact). Second, we collect spurious-claim-related tweets and retweets from Twitter, one of the world's largest social networks. Third, we provide basic user information, including the terms and characteristics of “heavy fake news” user to present a better understanding of T/F claims in consideration of COVID-19. FibVID provides several significant contributions. It helps to uncover propagation patterns of news items and themes related to identifying their authenticity. It further helps catalog and identify the traits of users who engage in fake news diffusion. We also provide suggestions for future applications of FibVID with a few exploratory analyses to examine the effectiveness of the approaches used.},

@article{Samadi2021,
abstract = {In recent years, due to the widespread use of social media and broadcasting agencies around the world, people are extremely exposed to being affected by false information and fake news, all of which have negative impacts on both collective thoughts and governments' policies. In recent years, the great success of pre-trained models for embedding contextual information from texts motivates researchers to utilize these embeddings in different natural language processing tasks. However, in a complex task like fake news detection, it is not determined which contextualized embedding can assist the classifier with more valuable features. Due to the lack of a comparative study about utilizing different contextualized pre-trained models besides distinct neural classifiers, we aim to dive into a comparative study about using different classifiers and embedding models. In this paper, we propose three classifiers with different pre-trained models for embedding input news articles. We connect Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) after the embedding layer which consists of novel pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT2, and Funnel Transformer in order to benefit from deep contextualized representation provided by those models as well as deep neural classifications. We evaluate our proposed models on three well-known fake news datasets: LIAR (Wang, 2017), ISOT (Ahmed et al., 2017), and COVID-19 Patwa et al. (2020). The results on these three datasets show the superiority of our proposed models for fake news detection compared to the state-of-the-art models. The results show 7% and 0.1% improvements in classification accuracy compared to the proposed model by Goldani et al. (2021) on LIAR and ISOT, respectively. We also achieved 1% improvement compared to the proposed model by Shifath et al. (2021) on the COVID-19 dataset.},

@article{AbuSalem2019,
abstract = {Most currently available fake news datasets revolve around US politics, entrainment news or satire. They are typically scraped from fact-checking websites, where the articles are labeled by human experts. In this paper, we present FA-KES, a fake news dataset around the Syrian war. Given the specific nature of news reporting on incidents of wars and the lack of available sources from which manually-labeled news articles can be scraped, we believe a fake news dataset specifically constructed for this domain is crucial. To ensure a balanced dataset that covers the many facets of the Syrian war, our dataset consists of news articles from several media outlets representing mobilisation press, loyalist press, and diverse print media. To avoid the difficult and often-subjective task of manually labeling news articles as true or fake, we employ a semi-supervised fact-checking approach to label the news articles in our dataset. With the help of crowdsourcing, human contributors are prompted to extract specific and easy-to-extract information that helps match a given article to information representing “ground truth” obtained from the Syrian Violations Documentation Center. The information extracted is then used to cluster the articles into two separate sets using unsupervised machine learning. The result is a carefully annotated dataset consisting of 804 articles labeled as true or fake and that is ideal for training machine learning models to predict the credibility of news articles. Our dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2607278. Although our dataset is focused on the Syrian crisis, it can be used to train machine learning models to detect fake news in other related domains. Moreover, the framework we used to obtain the dataset is general enough to be used to build other fake news datasets around military conflicts, provided there is some corresponding ground-truth available.},

abstract = {From conspiracy theories to fake cures and fake treatments, COVID-19 has become a hotbed for the spread of misinformation online. It is more important than ever to identify methods to debunk and correct false information online. In this paper, we present a methodology and analyses to characterize the two competing COVID-19 misinformation communities online: (i) misinformed users or users who are actively posting misinformation, and (ii) informed users or users who are actively spreading true information, or calling out misinformation. The goals of this study are twofold: (i) collecting a diverse set of annotated COVID-19 Twitter dataset that can be used by the research community to conduct meaningful analysis; and (ii) characterizing the two target communities in terms of their network structure, linguistic patterns, and their membership in other communities. Our analyses show that COVID-19 misinformed communities are denser, and more organized than informed communities, with a possibility of a high volume of the misinformation being part of disinformation campaigns. Our analyses also suggest that a large majority of misinformed users may be anti-vaxxers. Finally, our sociolinguistic analyses suggest that COVID-19 informed users tend to use more narratives than misinformed users.},

@article{Verma2021,
abstract = {Social media is a popular medium for the dissemination of real-time news all over the world. Easy and quick information proliferation is one of the reasons for its popularity. An extensive number of users with different age groups, gender, and societal beliefs are engaged in social media websites. Despite these favorable aspects, a significant disadvantage comes in the form of fake news, as people usually read and share information without caring about its genuineness. Therefore, it is imperative to research methods for the authentication of news. To address this issue, this article proposes a two-phase benchmark model named WELFake based on word embedding (WE) over linguistic features for fake news detection using machine learning classification. The first phase preprocesses the data set and validates the veracity of news content by using linguistic features. The second phase merges the linguistic feature sets with WE and applies voting classification. To validate its approach, this article also carefully designs a novel WELFake data set with approximately 72 000 articles, which incorporates different data sets to generate an unbiased classification output. Experimental results show that the WELFake model categorizes the news in real and fake with a 96.73% which improves the overall accuracy by 1.31% compared to bidirectional encoder representations from transformer (BERT) and 4.25% compared to convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Our frequency-based and focused analyzing writing patterns model outperforms predictive-based related works implemented using the Word2vec WE method by up to 1.73%.},
