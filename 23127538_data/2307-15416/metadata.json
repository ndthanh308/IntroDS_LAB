  "abstract": "We establish a ramified class field theory for smooth projective curves over local fields. As key steps in the proof, we obtain new results in the class field theory for 2-dimensional local fields of positive characteristic, and prove a duality theorem for the logarithmic Hodge-Witt cohomology on affine curves over local fields.",
