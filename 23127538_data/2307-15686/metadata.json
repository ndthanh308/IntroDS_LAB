  "abstract": "Let $(X, Δ)$ be a projective klt pair of dimension $2$ and let $L$ be a nef $\\mathbb{Q}$-divisor on $X$ such that $K_X + Δ+ L$ is nef. As a complement to the Generalized Abundance Conjecture by Lazić and Peternell, we prove that if $K_X + Δ$ and $L$ are not proportional modulo numerical equivalence, then $K_X + Δ+ L$ is semiample. An example due to Lazić shows that this is no longer true in any dimension $n \\ge 3$.",
