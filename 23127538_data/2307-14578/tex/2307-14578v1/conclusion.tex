\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end gait detection and recognition approach to address challenging unconstrained conditions. First, we introduce a gait detector to identify sequences that contain gait movement and with complete body. With the gait detector, we can obtain gait sequences without non-walking frames. And it is convenient to incorporate with most existing backbones, just with an extra step to generate the DHS. Secondly, the gait recognition pipeline utilizes both RGB and silhouette modality to learn robust representation. Notably, we address the silhouette size normalization problem with a simple yet effective ratio attention signal.
Additionally, we enhance the silhouette modality embedding through feature distillation from the RGB modality. Such a design helps leverage the well-learned feature space of RGB modality with the robustness of silhouettes and does not require RGB input at test time. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method improves the performance on Gait3D in cross-domain evaluation and achieves SoTA performance in the standard CASIA-B and the more challenging BRIAR datasets. %Besides, we conduct a comprehensive verification analysis on them.
