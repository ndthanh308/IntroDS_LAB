In this paper, we present a novel gait detection and recognition approach to address challenging unconstrained conditions. First, we introduce a gait detector to identify frames that contain gait with a complete body. 
With the help of a gait detector, gait recognition and person ReID can cooperate complementarily to achieve higher performance. Secondly, the gait recognition pipeline utilizes both RGB and silhouette modality to learn robust representations. Notably, we fill the viewpoint information leakage with a simple yet effective ratio attention signal.
Additionally, we enhance the silhouette modality embedding through feature distillation from the RGB modality. Such a design helps to leverage the well-learned feature space of RGB modality with the robustness of silhouettes and does not require RGB data at test time. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method improves the performance on Gait3D in cross-domain evaluation and achieves SoTA performance in the standard CASIA-B and the challenging BRIAR dataset. %
