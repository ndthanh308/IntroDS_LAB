  "abstract": "Widefield quantum diamond microscopy (WQDM) based on Kohler-illumination has been widely adopted in the field of quantum sensing, however, practical applications are still limited by issues such as unavoidable photodamage and unsatisfied spatial-resolution. Here, we design and develop a super-resolution enabled WQDM using a digital micromirror device (DMD)-based structured illumination microscopy. With the rapidly programmable illumination patterns, we have firstly demonstrated how to mitigate phototoxicity when imaging nanodiamonds in cell samples. As a showcase, we have performed the super-resolved quantum sensing measurements of two individual nanodiamonds not even distinguishable with conventional WQDM. The DMD-powered WQDM presents not only excellent compatibility with quantum sensing solutions, but also strong advantages in high imaging speed, high resolution, low phototoxicity, and enhanced signal-to-background ratio, making it a competent tool to for applications in demanding fields such as biomedical science.",
