  "abstract": "Semantic segmentation plays a vital role in computer vision tasks, enabling precise pixel-level understanding of images. In this paper, we present a comprehensive library for semantic segmentation, which contains implementations of popular segmentation models like SegNet, FCN, UNet, and PSPNet. We also evaluate and compare these models on several datasets, offering researchers and practitioners a powerful toolset for tackling diverse segmentation challenges.",
