abstract = {PsbS plays a major role in activating the photoprotection mechanism known as “non-photochemical quenching,” which dissipates chlorophyll excited states exceeding the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport. PsbS activity is known to be triggered by low lumenal pH. However, the molecular mechanism by which this subunit regulates light harvesting efficiency is still unknown. Here we show that PsbS controls the association/dissociation of a five-subunit membrane complex, composed of two monomeric Lhcb proteins (CP29 and CP24) and the trimeric LHCII-M. Dissociation of this supercomplex is indispensable for the onset of non-photochemical fluorescence quenching in high light, strongly suggesting that protein subunits catalyzing the reaction of heat dissipation are buried into the complex and thus not available for interaction with PsbS. Consistently, we showed that knock-out mutants on two subunits participating to the B4C complex were strongly affected in heat dissipation. Direct observation by electron microscopy and image analysis showed that B4C dissociation leads to the redistribution of PSII within grana membranes. We interpreted these results to mean that the dissociation of B4C makes quenching sites, possibly CP29 and CP24, available for the switch to an energy-quenching conformation. These changes are reversible and do not require protein synthesis/degradation, thus allowing for changes in PSII antenna size and adaptation to rapidly changing environmental conditions.}

The regulation of light harvesting involves the photoprotective dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in the light-harvesting antenna complexes (LHCs) as heat. Here, we report an investigation into the structural basis of light-harvesting regulation in intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts using freeze-fracture electron microscopy, combined with laser confocal microscopy employing the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique. The results demonstrate that formation of the photoprotective state requires a structural reorganization of the photosynthetic membrane involving dissociation of LHCII from PSII and its aggregation. The structural changes are manifested by a reduced mobility of LHC antenna chlorophyll proteins. It is demonstrated that these changes occur rapidly and reversibly within 5 min of illumination and dark relaxation, are dependent on ΔpH, and are enhanced by the deepoxidation of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin.}",

While the major antenna complex, {LHCII}, is known to be a site of {NPQ}, the precise mechanism of excitation quenching is not clearly understood. A preliminary model of the quenched crystal structure of {LHCII} implied that quenching arises from slow energy capture by Car pigments. It predicted a thoroughly quenched system but offered little insight into the defining aspects of this quenching. In this work, we present a thorough theoretical investigation of this quenching, addressing the factors defining the quenching pathway and possible mechanism for its (de)activation. We show that quenching in {LHCII} crystals is the result of slow energy transfer from chlorophyll to the centrally-bound lutein Cars, predominantly the Lut620 associated with the chlorophyll ‘terminal emitter’, one of the proposed in vivo pathways. We show that this quenching is rather independent of the particular species of Car and excitation ‘site’ energy. The defining parameter is the resonant coupling between the pigment co-factors. Lastly, we show that these interactions must be severely suppressed for a light-harvesting state to be recovered.},

We have used a combination of time-dependent density functional theory ({TD}-{DFT}) and the semiempirical {MNDO}-{CAS}-{CI} method to model the chlorophyll–lutein energy transfer dynamics of the highly quenched crystal structure of {LHCII}. Our calculations reveal that the incoherent “hopping” of energy from Chla612 to the short-lived, dipole forbidden 21Ag– state of lutein620 accounts for the strong fluorescence quenching observed in these crystals. This adds weight to the argument that the same dissipative pathway is responsible for in vivo {NPQ}.},

It is generally accepted that the major photosystem {II} antenna protein, {LHCII}, is the site of {NPQ}, although the minor antenna complexes ({CP}24/26/29) are also proposed as alternative/additional {NPQ} sites. {LHCII} crystals were shown to exhibit the short excitation lifetime and several spectral signatures of the quenched state. Subsequent structure-based models showed that this quenching could be explained by slow energy trapping by the carotenoids, in line with one of the proposed models. Using Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy ({FLIM}) we show that the crystal structure of {CP}29 corresponds to a strongly quenched conformation. Using a structure-based theoretical model we show that this quenching may be explained by the same slow, carotenoid-mediated quenching mechanism present in {LHCII} crystals.},

Here we use transient absorption spectroscopy to track excitation energy dispersing from the optically accessible vibronic subsystem into the remaining vibrational subsystem of the solute and solvent. Monitoring the flow of energy during vibrational redistribution enables quantification of local molecular heating. Subsequent heat dissipation away from the solute molecule is characterized by classical thermodynamics and molecular dynamics simulations. Hence, we present a holistic approach that tracks the internal temperature and vibronic distribution from the act of photo-excitation to the restoration of the global equilibrium. Within this framework internal vibrational redistribution and vibrational cooling are emergent phenomena. We demonstrate the validity of the framework by examining a highly controversial example, carotenoids. We show that correctly accounting for the local temperature unambiguously explains their energetically and temporally congested spectral dynamics without the ad hoc postulation of additional ‘dark’ states. An immediate further application of this approach would be to monitor the excitation and thermal dynamics of pigment–protein systems.},

While positioning of chlorophyll cofactors is well understood and rationalized by the principle of an “energy funnel”, the carotenoids still pose many open questions. Particularly, their short excited state lifetime ({\textless}25 ps) renders them potential energy sinks able to compete with the reaction centers and drastically undermine light-harvesting efficiency. Exploration of the orientational phase-space revealed that the placement of central carotenoids minimizes their interaction with the nearest chlorophylls in the plant antenna complexes {LHCII}, {CP}26, {CP}29 and {LHCI}. At the same time we show that this interaction is highly sensitive to structural perturbations, which has a profound effect on the overall lifetime of the complex.

On the other hand, intense sunlight may result in overexcitation of the light-harvesting antenna and the formation of reactive compounds capable of ‘burning out’ the whole photosynthetic unit. Non-photochemical quenching is a self-regulatory mechanism utilized by green plants on a molecular level that allows them to safely dissipate the detrimental excess excitation energy as heat. Although it is believed to take place in the plant's major light-harvesting complexes ({LHC}) {II}, there is still no consensus regarding its molecular nature. To get more insight into its physical origin, we performed high-resolution time-resolved fluorescence measurements of {LHCII} trimers and their aggregates across a wide temperature range. Based on simulations of the excitation energy transfer in the {LHCII} aggregate, we associate the red-emitting state, having fluorescence maximum at ∼700 nm, with the partial mixing of excitonic and chlorophyll–chlorophyll charge transfer states. On the other hand, the quenched state has a totally different nature and is related to the incoherent excitation transfer to the short-lived carotenoid excited states. Our results also show that the required level of photoprotection in vivo can be achieved by a very subtle change in the number of {LHCIIs} switched to the quenched state.},

The pathways along which excitation energy is transferred between them, and their assembly mechanisms, remain to be deciphered through high-resolution structural studies. Here we report the structure of a 1.1-megadalton spinach photosystem {II}–{LHCII} supercomplex solved at 3.2 Å resolution through single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals a homodimeric supramolecular system in which each monomer contains 25 protein subunits, 105 chlorophylls, 28 carotenoids and other cofactors. Three extrinsic subunits ({PsbO}, {PsbP} and {PsbQ}), which are essential for optimal oxygen-evolving activity of photosystem {II}, form a triangular crown that shields the Mn4CaO5-binding domains of {CP}43 and D1. One major trimeric and two minor monomeric {LHCIIs} associate with each core-complex monomer, and the antenna–core interactions are reinforced by three small intrinsic subunits ({PsbW}, {PsbH} and {PsbZ}). By analysing the closely connected interfacial chlorophylls, we have obtained detailed insights into the energy-transfer pathways between the antenna and core complexes.},

The spectral shapes and relaxation/migration rates have been calculated using the combined Redfield–Förster approach capable of correctly describing fast relaxation within strongly coupled chlorophyll (Chl) a and bclusters and slow migration between them. Within each monomeric subunit of the trimeric complex there is fast (sub-ps) conversion from Chl's b to Chl's a at the stromal side accompanied by slow ({\textgreater}10 ps) equilibration between the stromal- and lumenal-side Chl aclusters in combination with slow ({\textgreater}13 ps) population of Chl's a from the ‘bottleneck’ Chl a604 site. The connection between monomeric subunits is determined by exciton coupling between the stromal-side Chl's b from the two adjacent subunits (Chl b601′-608-609 cluster) making a simultaneous fast (sub-ps) population of the Chl's a possible from both subunits. Final equilibration occurs via slow ({\textgreater}20 ps) migration between the Chl aclusters located on different monomeric subunits. This migration includes up-hill transfers from the red-most Chl a610-611-612 clusters located at the peripheral side in each subunit to the Chl a602-603 dimers located at the inner side of the trimeric {LHCII} complex.},

By dissipating excess excitation energy of chlorophyll molecules as heat, {NPQ} balances the input and utilization of light energy in photosynthesis and protects the plant against photooxidative damage. To understand the physical mechanism of {NPQ}, we have performed femtosecond transient absorption experiments on intact thylakoid membranes isolated from spinach and transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. These plants have well defined quenching capabilities and distinct contents of xanthophyll (Xan) cycle carotenoids. The kinetics probed in the spectral region of the S1 → Sn transition of Xans (530–580 nm) were found to be significantly different under the quenched and unquenched conditions, corresponding to maximum and no {NPQ}, respectively. The lifetime and the spectral characteristics indicate that the kinetic difference originated from the involvement of the S1 state of a specific Xan, zeaxanthin, in the quenched case.},

In plant photosynthesis, {LHCII}, the major antenna complex of Photosystem {II}, employs a delicate switch between light harvesting and photoprotective modes. The switch is triggered by an enlarged {pH} gradient (Δ{pH}) across the thylakoid membranes. Using molecular simulations and quantum calculations, we show that Δ{pH} can tune the light-harvesting potential of the antenna via allosteric regulation of the excitonic coupling in chlorophyll–carotenoid pairs. To this end, we propose how the {LHCII} excited state lifetime is coupled to the environmental conditions. In line with experimental findings, our theoretical model provides crucial evidence toward the elucidation of the photoprotective switch of higher plants at an all-atom resolution.},

Here, we present an advanced but general computational strategy that allows tensor network methods to effectively compute the non-perturbative, real-time dynamics of exponentially large vibronic wave functions of real molecules. We demonstrate how ab initio modelling, machine learning and entanglement analysis can enable simulations which provide real-time insight and direct visualisation of dissipative photophysics, and illustrate this with an example based on the ultrafast process known as singlet fission.},

	abstract = {Excitation energy transfer and quenching in {LHCII} aggregates is considered in terms of a coarse-grained model. The model assumes that the excitation energy transfer within a pigment–protein complex is much faster than the intercomplex excitation energy transfer, whereas the quenching ability is attributed to a specific pigment–protein complex responsible for the nonphotochemical quenching ({NPQ}). It is demonstrated that the pump–probe experimental data obtained at low excitation intensities for {LHCII} aggregates under {NPQ} conditions can be equally well explained at two limiting cases, either describing the excitation kinetics in the migration-limited or in the trap-limited regime. Thus, it is concluded that low excitation conditions do not allow one to unambiguously define the relationship between the mean times of excitation migration and trapping. However, this could be achieved by using high excitation conditions when exciton–exciton annihilation is dominant. In this case it was found that in the trap-limited regime the excitation kinetics in the aggregate should be almost insensitive to the excitation density, meaning that singlet–singlet annihilation has little effect on the {NPQ} decay kinetics, whereas in the migration-limited case there is a clear intensity dependence. In order to account for the random distribution of the {NPQ}-traps within the {LHCII} aggregates, excitation diffusion in a continuous medium with random static traps was considered. This description demonstrates a very good correspondence to the experimental fluorescence kinetics assuming a lamellar (quasi-3D) structure of the antenna characterized by the dimension d = 2.4 and therefore justifying the diffusion-limited approach on which the model is based. Using the coarse-grained model to describe the aggregate we estimate one {NPQ}-trap per 100 monomeric {LHCII} complexes. Finally we discuss the origin of the traps responsible for excitation quenching under {NPQ} conditions.},

To avoid photodamage, various protection mechanisms are induced that dissipate excess excitations, which otherwise could lead to the formation of harmful molecular species like singlet oxygen. This Non-Photochemical Quenching ({NPQ}) of excitations can be monitored via a decrease of the chlorophyll fluorescence. There is consensus that in plants 1) there are at least two major {NPQ} (sub)processes and 2) {NPQ} (de)activation occurs on various time scales, ranging from (tens of) seconds to minutes. This relatively slow switching has a negative effect on photosynthetic efficiency, and Kromdijk et al. demonstrated in 2016 (Science 354, 857) that faster switching rates can lead to increased crop productivity. Very recently, we were involved in the discovery of a new {NPQ} process that switches off well within a millisecond (Farooq et al. (2018) Nat. Plants 4, 225). Here we describe the current level of knowledge regarding this process and discuss its implications.},

Nature 2004, 428, 287−292; Standfuss et al. {EMBO} J. 2005, 24, 919−928) by using a combined quantum chemical/electrostatic method (Müh et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007, 104, 16862−16867) that has been modified to cover membrane proteins and to account more realistically for the behavior of protonatable groups under the conditions of low-temperature optical spectroscopy. The obtained exciton levels are in reasonable agreement with experimental information (including linear absorption, linear dichroism, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectra of native as well as wild-type-minus-mutant difference absorption spectra of recombinant {LHCII}) and differ from earlier treatments based on fitted site energies (Novoderezhkin et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2005, 109, 10493−10504) mainly by assigning a lower energy level to Chla 604 (in the nomenclature of Liu et al.) and Chlb 608 and a higher energy level to Chlb 605 and 609. The energy sink at cyrogenic temperatures is located at Chla 610 in the stromal layer of pigments, but structural changes at elevated temperatures may change the nature of the terminal emitter domain (including Chla 610/611/612). The site energy red-shift of Chla 610 is calculated to be significantly larger on the basis of the crystal structure of Standfuss et al. compared to that of Liu et al. due to conformational differences in the neighborhood of this pigment. A possible conformational change in the vicinity of Chla 604 involving tyrosine 112 and neoxanthin is found to strongly affect the site energy of this Chla and render it an alternative energy sink in the lumenal layer. A detailed, structure-based analysis of electrostatic pigment−protein interactions is performed to identify amino acid residues that are of interest for future mutagenesis experiments with the aim to further characterize the energy sinks, putative “bottleneck” states for excitation energy transfer, and potential sites of nonphotochemical quenching.},

	abstract = {An accurate and numerically efficient method for the calculation of intermolecular Coulomb couplings between charge densities of electronic states and between transition densities of electronic excitations is presented. The coupling of transition densities yields the Förster type excitation energy transfer coupling, and from the charge density coupling, a shift in molecular excitation energies results. Starting from an ab initio calculation of the charge and transition densities, atomic partial charges are determined such as to fit the resulting electrostatic potentials of the different states and the transition. The different intermolecular couplings are then obtained from the Coulomb couplings between the respective atomic partial charges. The excitation energy transfer couplings obtained in the present {TrEsp} (transition charge from electrostatic potential) method are compared with couplings obtained from the simple point-dipole and extended dipole approximations and with those from the ab initio transition density cube method of Krüger, Scholes, and Fleming. The present method is of the same accuracy as the latter but computationally more efficient. The method is applied to study strongly coupled pigments in the light-harvesting complexes of green sulfur bacteria ({FMO}), purple bacteria ({LH}2), and higher plants ({LHC}-{II}) and the “special pairs” of bacterial reaction centers and reaction centers of photosystems I and {II}. For the pigment dimers in the antennae, it is found that the mutual orientation of the pigments is optimized for maximum excitonic coupling. A driving force for this orientation is the Coulomb coupling between ground-state charge densities. In the case of excitonic couplings in the “special pairs”, a breakdown of the point-dipole approximation is found for all three reaction centers, but the extended dipole approximation works surprisingly well, if the extent of the transition dipole is chosen larger than assumed previously. For the “special pairs”, a large shift in local transition energies is found due to charge density coupling.},

	abstract = {Time-local and time-nonlocal theories are used in combination with optical spectroscopy to characterize the water-soluble chlorophyll binding protein complex ({WSCP}) from cauliflower. The recombinant cauliflower {WSCP} complexes reconstituted with either chlorophyll b (Chl b) or Chl a/Chl b mixtures are characterized by absorption spectroscopy at 77 and 298 K and circular dichroism at 298 K. On the basis of the analysis of these spectra and spectra reported for recombinant {WSCP} reconstituted with Chl a only (Hughes, J. L.; Razeghifard, R.; Logue, M.; Oakley, A.; Wydrzynski, T.; Krausz, E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. U.S.A. 2006, 128, 3649), the “open-sandwich” model proposed for the structure of the pigment dimer is refined. Our calculations show that, for a reasonable description of the data, a reduction of the angle between pigment planes from 60° of the original model to about 30° is required when exciton relaxation-induced lifetime broadening is included in the analysis of optical spectra. The temperature dependence of the absorption spectrum is found to provide a unique test for the two non-Markovian theories of optical spectra. Based on our data and the 1.7 K spectra of Hughes et al. (2006), the time-local partial ordering prescription theory is shown to describe the experimental results over the whole temperature range between 1.7 K and room temperature, whereas the alternative time-nonlocal chronological ordering prescription theory fails at high temperatures. Modified-Redfield theory predicts sub-100 fs exciton relaxation times for the homodimers and a 450 fs time constant in the heterodimers. Whereas the simpler Redfield theory gives a similar time constant for the homodimers, the one for the heterodimers deviates strongly in the two theories. The difference is explained by multivibrational quanta transitions in the protein which are neglected in Redfield theory.},

Conformational changes of the photosynthetic antenna complexes activate dissipation by leveraging the sensitivity of the photophysics to the protein structure. The mechanisms of dissipation remain debated, largely due to two challenges. First, because of the ultrafast timescales and large energy gaps involved, measurements lacked the temporal or spectral requirements. Second, experiments have been performed in detergent, which can induce non-native conformations, or in vivo, where contributions from homologous antenna complexes cannot be disentangled. Here, we overcome both challenges by applying ultrabroadband two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to the principal antenna complex, {LHCII}, in a near-native membrane. Our data provide evidence that the membrane enhances two dissipative pathways, one of which is a previously uncharacterized chlorophyll-to-carotenoid energy transfer. Our results highlight the sensitivity of the photophysics to local environment, which may control the balance between light harvesting and dissipation in vivo.},

	abstract = {Plants possess an essential ability to rapidly down-regulate light-harvesting in response to high light. This photoprotective process involves the formation of energy-quenching interactions between the chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments within the antenna of Photosystem {II} ({PSII}). The nature of these interactions is currently debated, with, among others, ‘incoherent’ or ‘coherent’ quenching models (or a combination of the two) suggested by a range of time-resolved spectroscopic measurements. In ‘incoherent quenching’, energy is transferred from a chlorophyll to a carotenoid and is dissipated due to the intrinsically short excitation lifetime of the latter. ‘Coherent quenching’ would arise from the quantum mechanical mixing of chlorophyll and carotenoid excited state properties, leading to a reduction in chlorophyll excitation lifetime. The key parameters are the energy gap, \$\${\textbackslash}Updelta {\textbackslash}varepsilon ={\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Car\}-{\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Chl\},\$\$and the resonance coupling, J, between the two excited states. Coherent quenching will be the dominant process when \$\$-J{\textless}{\textbackslash}Updelta {\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textless}J,\$\$i.e., when the two molecules are resonant, while the quenching will be largely incoherent when \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Chl\}{\textgreater}({\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Car\}+J).\$\$One would expect quenching to be energetically unfavorable for \$\${\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Chl\}{\textless}({\textbackslash}varepsilon\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Car\}-J).\$\$The actual dynamics of quenching lie somewhere between these limiting regimes and have non-trivial dependencies of both J and \$\${\textbackslash}Updelta {\textbackslash}varepsilon.\$\$Using the Hierarchical Equation of Motion ({HEOM}) formalism we present a detailed theoretical examination of these excitation dynamics and their dependence on slow variations in J and \$\${\textbackslash}Updelta {\textbackslash}varepsilon.\$\$We first consider an isolated chlorophyll–carotenoid dimer before embedding it within a {PSII} antenna sub-unit ({LHCII}). We show that neither energy transfer, nor the mixing of excited state lifetimes represent unique or necessary pathways for quenching and in fact discussing them as distinct quenching mechanisms is misleading. However, we do show that quenching cannot be switched ‘on’ and ‘off’ by fine tuning of \$\${\textbackslash}Updelta {\textbackslash}varepsilon\$\$around the resonance point, \$\${\textbackslash}Updelta {\textbackslash}varepsilon =0.\$\$Due to the large reorganization energy of the carotenoid excited state, we find that the presence (or absence) of coherent interactions have almost no impact of the dynamics of quenching. Counter-intuitively significant quenching is present even when the carotenoid excited state lies above that of the chlorophyll. We also show that, above a rather small threshold value of \$\$J{\textgreater}10{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$\$quenching becomes less and less sensitive to J (since in the window \$\$-J{\textless}{\textbackslash}Updelta {\textbackslash}varepsilon {\textless}J\$\$the overall lifetime is independent of it). The requirement for quenching appear to be only that \$\$J{\textgreater}0.\$\$Although the coherent/incoherent character of the quenching can vary, the overall kinetics are likely robust with respect to fluctuations in J and \$\${\textbackslash}Updelta {\textbackslash}varepsilon.\$\$This may be the basis for previous observations of {NPQ} with both coherent and incoherent features.},

	abstract = {Antenna complexes in photosystems of plants and green algae are able to switch between a light-harvesting unquenched conformation and a quenched conformation so to avoid photodamage. When the switch is activated, nonphotochemical quenching ({NPQ}) mechanisms take place for an efficient deactivation of excess excitation energy. The molecular details of these mechanisms have not been fully clarified but different hypotheses have been proposed. Among them, a popular one involves excitation energy transfer ({EET}) from the singlet excited Chls to the lowest singlet state (S1) of carotenoids. In this work, we combine such model with μs-long molecular dynamics simulations of the {CP}29 minor antenna complex to investigate how conformational fluctuations affect the electronic couplings and the final {EET} quenching. The computational framework is applied to both {CP}29 embedding violaxanthin and zeaxantin in its L2 site. Our results demonstrate that the {EET} model is rather insensitive to physically reasonable variations in single chlorophyll-carotenoid couplings, and that very large conformational changes would be needed to see the large variation of the complex lifetime expected in the switch from light-harvesting to quenched state. We show, however, that a major role in regulating the {EET} quenching is played by the S1 energy of the carotenoid, in line with very recent spectroscopy experiments.},

It has been proposed that the energy absorbed in excess is dissipated via protein conformational changes of individual {LHCs}. However, the exact quenching mechanism remains unclear. Here we study the mechanism of quenching in {LHCs} that bind a single carotenoid species and are constitutively in a dissipative conformation. Via femtosecond spectroscopy we resolve a number of carotenoid dark states, demonstrating that the carotenoid is bound to the complex in different conformations. Some of those states act as excitation energy donors for the chlorophylls, whereas others act as quenchers. Via in silico analysis we show that structural changes of carotenoids are expected in the {LHC} protein domains exposed to the chloroplast lumen, where acidification triggers photoprotection in vivo. We propose that structural changes of {LHCs} control the conformation of the carotenoids, thus permitting access to different dark states responsible for either light harvesting or photoprotection.},

Simultaneously, a linear correlation between both Chl fluorescence quenching and φ{CouplingCar} S1−Chl with the intensity of red-shifted bands in the Chl Qy and carotenoid absorption was also observed. These results suggest quenching excitonic Car S1−Chl states as origin for the observed effects. Furthermore, real time measurements of the light-dependent down- and up-regulation of the photosynthetic activity and φ{CouplingCar} S1−Chl in wild-type and mutant (npq1, npq2, npq4, lut2 and {WT}+{PsbS}) Arabidopsis thaliana plants reveal that also in vivo the quenching parameter {NPQ} correlates always linearly with the extent of electronic Car S1–Chl interactions in any adaptation status. Our in vivo measurements with Arabidopsis variants show that during high light illumination, φ{CouplingCar} S1−Chl depends on the presence of {PsbS} and zeaxanthin (Zea) in an almost identical way as {NPQ}. In summary, these results provide clear evidence for a very close link between electronic Car S1–Chl interactions and the regulation of photosynthesis. These findings support a photophysical mechanism in which short-living, low excitonic carotenoid–chlorophyll states serve as traps and dissipation valves for excess excitation energy.},

	abstract = {Feedback de-excitation ({qE}) regulates light harvesting in plants to prevent inhibition of photosynthesis when light absorption exceeds photosynthetic capacity. Although the mechanism of {qE} is not completely understood, it is known to require a low thylakoid lumen {pH}, de-epoxidized xanthophylls, and the photosystem {II} protein {PsbS}. During a short-term 4-h exposure to excess light, three {PsbS}- and {qE}-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that differed in xanthophyll composition were more photoinhibited than the wild type. The extent of photoinhibition was the same in all of the mutants, suggesting that {qE} capacity rather than xanthophyll composition is critical for photoprotection in short-term high light, in contrast to longer-term high light conditions (days) when additional antioxidant roles of specific xanthophylls are evident. Plants with a 2-fold increase in {qE} capacity were generated by overexpression of {PsbS}, demonstrating that the level of {PsbS} limits the {qE} capacity in wild-type Arabidopsis. These results are consistent with the idea that variations in {PsbS} expression are responsible for species-specific and environmentally induced differences in {qE} capacity observed in nature. Furthermore, plants with higher {qE} capacity were more resistant to photoinhibition than the wild type. Increased {qE} was associated with decreased photosystem {II} excitation pressure and changes in the fractional areas of chlorophyll a fluorescence lifetime distributions, but not the lifetime centers, suggesting that {qE} protects from photoinhibition by preventing overreduction of photosystem {II} electron acceptors. Engineering of {qE} capacity by {PsbS} overexpression could potentially yield crop plants that are more resistant to environmental stress.},

	abstract = {Carotenoids in photosynthetic proteins carry out the dual function of harvesting light and defending against photo-damage by quenching excess energy. The latter involves the low-lying, dark, excited state labelled S1. Here “dark” means optically-forbidden, a property that is often attributed to molecular symmetry, which leads to speculation that its optical properties may be strongly-perturbed by structural distortions. This has been both explicitly and implicitly proposed as an important feature of photo-protective energy quenching. Here we present a theoretical analysis of the relationship between structural distortions and S1 optical properties. We outline how S1 is dark not because of overall geometric symmetry but because of a topological symmetry related to bond length alternation in the conjugated backbone. Taking the carotenoid echinenone as an example and using a combination of molecular dynamics, quantum chemistry, and the theory of spectral lineshapes, we show that distortions that break this symmetry are extremely stiff. They are therefore absent in solution and only marginally present in even a very highly-distorted protein binding pocket such as in the Orange Carotenoid Protein ({OCP}).

For 2PE, excitation at 1210 and 1300 nm was used, being within the known 2PE profile of {LHCII}. At both excitation wavelengths, the transient absorption spectra exhibit a shape characteristic of excited chlorophylls with only a minor contribution from carotenoids. We compare the 2PE data measured for {LHCII} with those obtained from 2PE of a lutein/chlorophyll a mixture in acetone. We estimate that although the 2PE cross section of a single carotenoid in acetone is ∼1.7 times larger than that of a Chl a, due to the 1:3.5 carotenoid/Chl ratio in {LHCII}, only one-third of the absorbed 2PE photons excite carotenoids in {LHCII} in the 1200–1300 nm range.},

Uncovering the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon will help us to understand how plants dissipate the excess excitation energy through non-photochemical quenching ({NPQ}) process. The crystal structure of spinach and pea {LHCII} have been published, and recently, we solved another crystal structure of {LHCII} from cucumber at 2.66Å resolution. Here we present the first direct structural evidence indicating that the two lutein(Lut) molecules bound in each {LHCII} monomer have different conformations, Lut621 has a more twisted conformation than that of Lut620. The intimate interaction between the Lut620 and Chla612/Chla611 dimer leads to form a hetero-trimer, which is considered to be a potential quenching site. We also discovered that the dehydration of the {LHCII} crystals resulted in a notable shrinkage of the crystal unit cell dimensions which was accompanied by a red-shift of the fluorescence emission spectra of the crystals. These phenomena suggest the changes in the crystal packing during dehydration might be the cause of internal conformational changes within {LHCII}.

In plant photosynthesis, {LHCII}, the major antenna complex of Photosystem {II}, employs a delicate switch between light harvesting and photoprotective modes. The switch is triggered by an enlarged {pH} gradient (Δ{pH}) across the thylakoid membranes. Using molecular simulations and quantum calculations, we show that Δ{pH} can tune the light-harvesting potential of the antenna via allosteric regulation of the excitonic coupling in chlorophyll–carotenoid pairs. To this end, we propose how the {LHCII} excited state lifetime is coupled to the environmental conditions.

Through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, multiscale quantum chemical calculations, and kinetic modeling, we demonstrate that the quenching level can be finely tuned by the protein, by regulating the energy of the charge transfer state.

	abstract = {An accurate and numerically efficient method for the calculation of intermolecular Coulomb couplings between charge densities of electronic states and between transition densities of electronic excitations is presented. The coupling of transition densities yields the Förster type excitation energy transfer coupling, and from the charge density coupling, a shift in molecular excitation energies results. Starting from an ab initio calculation of the charge and transition densities, atomic partial charges are determined such as to fit the resulting electrostatic potentials of the different states and the transition. The different intermolecular couplings are then obtained from the Coulomb couplings between the respective atomic partial charges. The excitation energy transfer couplings obtained in the present {TrEsp} (transition charge from electrostatic potential) method are compared with couplings obtained from the simple point-dipole and extended dipole approximations and with those from the ab initio transition density cube method of Krüger, Scholes, and Fleming. The present method is of the same accuracy as the latter but computationally more efficient. The method is applied to study strongly coupled pigments in the light-harvesting complexes of green sulfur bacteria ({FMO}), purple bacteria ({LH}2), and higher plants ({LHC}-{II}) and the “special pairs” of bacterial reaction centers and reaction centers of photosystems I and {II}. For the pigment dimers in the antennae, it is found that the mutual orientation of the pigments is optimized for maximum excitonic coupling. A driving force for this orientation is the Coulomb coupling between ground-state charge densities. In the case of excitonic couplings in the “special pairs”, a breakdown of the point-dipole approximation is found for all three reaction centers, but the extended dipole approximation works surprisingly well, if the extent of the transition dipole is chosen larger than assumed previously. For the “special pairs”, a large shift in local transition energies is found due to charge density coupling.},

	abstract = {Light-harvesting complex {II} ({LHCII}) is the major antenna complex in higher plants and green algae. It has been suggested that a major part of the excited state energy dissipation in the so-called “non-photochemical quenching” ({NPQ}) is located in this antenna complex. We have performed an ultrafast kinetics study of the low-energy fluorescent states related to quenching in {LHCII} in both aggregated and the crystalline form. In both sample types the chlorophyll (Chl) excited states of {LHCII} are strongly quenched in a similar fashion. Quenching is accompanied by the appearance of new far-red ({FR}) fluorescence bands from energetically low-lying Chl excited states. The kinetics of quenching, its temperature dependence down to 4 K, and the properties of the {FR}-emitting states are very similar both in {LHCII} aggregates and in the crystal. No such {FR}-emitting states are found in unquenched trimeric {LHCII}. We conclude that these states represent weakly emitting Chl–Chl charge-transfer ({CT}) states, whose formation is part of the quenching process. Quantum chemical calculations of the lowest energy exciton and {CT} states, explicitly including the coupling to the specific protein environment, provide detailed insight into the chemical nature of the {CT} states and the mechanism of {CT} quenching. The experimental data combined with the results of the calculations strongly suggest that the quenching mechanism consists of a sequence of two proton-coupled electron transfer steps involving the three quenching center Chls 610/611/612. The {FR}-emitting {CT} states are reaction intermediates in this sequence. The polarity-controlled internal reprotonation of the E175/K179 aa pair is suggested as the switch controlling quenching. A unified model is proposed that is able to explain all known conditions of quenching or non-quenching of {LHCII}, depending on the environment without invoking any major conformational changes of the protein.},

Structural biology and spectroscopy approaches have led to a map of the architecture and energy transfer pathways between {LHC} pigments. Still, controversies remain regarding the role of specific carotenoids in light-harvesting and photoprotection, obligating the need for high-resolution techniques capable of identifying excited-state signatures and molecular identities of the various pigments in photosynthetic systems. Here we demonstrate the successful application of femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy ({FSRS}) to a multichromophoric biological complex, trimers of {LHCII}. We demonstrate the application of global and target analysis ({GTA}) to {FSRS} data and utilize it to quantify excitation migration in {LHCII} trimers. This powerful combination of techniques allows us to obtain valuable insights into structural, electronic, and dynamic information from the carotenoids of {LHCII} trimers. We report spectral and dynamical information on ground- and excited-state vibrational modes of the different pigments, resolving the vibrational relaxation of the carotenoids and the pathways of energy transfer to chlorophylls. The lifetimes and spectral characteristics obtained for the S1 state confirm that lutein 2 has a distorted conformation in {LHCII} and that the lutein 2 S1 state does not transfer to chlorophylls, while lutein 1 is the only carotenoid whose S1 state plays a significant energy-harvesting role. No appreciable energy transfer takes place from lutein 1 to lutein 2, contradicting recent proposals regarding the functions of the various carotenoids (Son et al. Chem. 2019, 5 (3), 575–584). Also, our results demonstrate that {FSRS} can be used in combination with {GTA} to simultaneously study the electronic and vibrational landscapes in {LHCs} and pave the way for in-depth studies of photoprotective conformations in photosynthetic systems.},

In contrast, the annihilation kinetics for aggregates can well be described by a kinetic approach over many hundreds of picoseconds, and it is shown that there is no clear distinction between inter- and intratrimer transfer of excitation energy. With this approach, an annihilation rate of (16 ps)(-1) is obtained after normalization of the annihilation rate per trimer. It is shown that the spatial equilibration in trimeric {LHCII} between chlorophyll a molecules occurs on a time scale that is an order of magnitude longer than in Photosystem I-core, after correcting for the different number of chlorophyll a molecules in both systems. The slow transfer in {LHCII} is possibly an important factor in determining excitation trapping in Photosystem {II}, because it contributes significantly to the overall trapping time.},

	abstract = {Photosystem {II} ({PSII}) uses light energy to split water into protons, electrons, and oxygen, ultimately sustaining heterotrophic life on Earth. The major light harvesting complex in plants ({LHCII}) is packed with chlorophylls and carotenoids and is the main supplier of excitation energy to {PSII} reaction centers. The protein scaffold acts as a programmed solvent for the pigments in {LHCII}, tuning their orientations while at the same time impeding concentration quenching to ensure efficient storage of excitation energy by chlorophylls. However, under stress, the very fuel of {PSII}, solar photons, can damage its delicate inner components and hamper photosynthesis. In a crucial regulatory strategy in plants, {LHCII} evolved a flexible design that allows it to switch between light-harvesting and dissipative conformations, thereby safely releasing the excess energy that is absorbed into heat. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain chlorophyll de-excitation pathways in {LHCII}, such as chlorophyll–chlorophyll charge transfer states, resonance energy transfer from chlorophylls to a carotenoid S1 state, and chlorophyll–carotenoid reductive energy transfer. This Perspective critically assesses the listed proposals, addressing both the physical mechanism of quenching and the nature of the quenching pigment. These hypotheses are then discussed in the context of state-of-the-art biochemical, physiological, and genetic knowledge to scrutinize their likeliness to occur in the native thylakoid membranes.},

	abstract = {Two-photon excitation, time-resolved fluorescence microscopy was used to investigate the fluorescence quenching mechanisms in aggregates of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b pigment protein complexes of photosystem {II} from green plants ({LHCII}). Time-gated microscopy images show the presence of large heterogeneity in fluorescence lifetimes not only for different {LHCII} aggregates, but also within a single aggregate. Thus, the fluorescence decay traces obtained from macroscopic measurements reflect an average over a large distribution of local fluorescence kinetics. This opens the possibility to resolve spatially different structural/functional units in chloroplasts and other heterogeneous photosynthetic systems in vivo, and gives the opportunity to investigate individually the excited states dynamics of each unit. We show that the lifetime distribution is sensitive to the concentration of quenchers contained in the system. Triplets, which are generated at high pulse repetition rates of excitation ({\textgreater}1 {MHz}), preferentially quench domains with initially shorter fluorescence lifetimes. This proves our previous prediction from singlet-singlet annihilation investigations (Barzda, V., V. Gulbinas, R. Kananavicius, V. Cervinskas, H. van Amerongen, R. van Grondelle, and L. Valkunas. 2001. Biophys. J. 80:2409-2421) that shorter fluorescence lifetimes originate from larger domains in {LHCII} aggregates. We found that singlet-singlet annihilation has a strong effect in time-resolved fluorescence microscopy of connective systems and has to be taken into consideration. Despite that, clear differences in fluorescence decays can be detected that can also qualitatively be understood.},

	abstract = {Light-Harvesting Complex {II} ({LHCII}) is a chlorophyll-protein antenna complex that efficiently absorbs solar energy and transfers electronic excited states to photosystems I and {II}. Under excess light intensity {LHCII} can adopt a photoprotective state in which excitation energy is safely dissipated as heat, a process known as Non-Photochemical Quenching ({NPQ}). In vivo {NPQ} is triggered by combinatorial factors including transmembrane Δ{pH}, {PsbS} protein and {LHCII}-bound zeaxanthin, leading to dramatically shortened {LHCII} fluorescence lifetimes. In vitro, {LHCII} in detergent solution or in proteoliposomes can reversibly adopt an {NPQ}-like state, via manipulation of detergent/protein ratio, lipid/protein ratio, {pH} or pressure. Previous spectroscopic investigations revealed changes in exciton dynamics and protein conformation that accompany quenching, however, {LHCII}-{LHCII} interactions have not been extensively studied. Here, we correlated fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ({FLIM}) and atomic force microscopy ({AFM}) of trimeric {LHCII} adsorbed to mica substrates and manipulated the environment to cause varying degrees of quenching. {AFM} showed that {LHCII} self-assembled onto mica forming 2D-aggregates (25–150 nm width). {FLIM} determined that {LHCII} in these aggregates were in a quenched state, with much lower fluorescence lifetimes ({\textasciitilde}0.25 ns) compared to free {LHCII} in solution (2.2–3.9 ns). {LHCII}-{LHCII} interactions were disrupted by thylakoid lipids or phospholipids, leading to intermediate fluorescent lifetimes (0.6–0.9 ns). To our knowledge, this is the first in vitro correlation of nanoscale membrane imaging with {LHCII} quenching. Our findings suggest that lipids could play a key role in modulating the extent of {LHCII}-{LHCII} interactions within the thylakoid membrane and so the propensity for {NPQ} activation.},

	abstract = {The diffusion of plastoquinol and its binding to the cytochrome bf complex, which occurs during linear photosynthetic electron transport and is analogous to reaction sequences found in most energy-converting membranes, has been studied in intact thylakoid membranes. The flash-induced electron transfer between the laterally separated photosystems {II} and photosystems I was measured by following the sigmoidal reduction kinetics of P-700+ after previous oxidation of the intersystem electron carriers. The amount of flash-induced plastoquinol produced at photosystem {II} was (a) reduced by inhibition with dichlorophenyl-dimethylurea and (b) increased by giving a second saturating flash. These signals were simulated by a new model which combines a deterministic simulation of reaction kinetics with a Monte Carlo approach to the diffusion of plastoquinol, taking into account the known structural features of the thylakoid membrane. The plastoquinol molecules were assumed to be oxidized by either a diffusion-limited or a nondiffusion-limited step in a collisional mechanism or after binding to the cytochrome bf complex. The model was able to account for the experimental observations with a nondiffusion-limited collisional mechanism or with a binding mechanism, giving minimum values for the diffusion coefficient of plastoquinol of 2×10-8 cm2s-1 and 3×10-7 cm2s-1, respectively.},

A mechanism of electron bifurcation, known as the Q-cycle, couples electron transfer to the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient for {ATP} synthesis. Cytb6f catalyses the rate-limiting step in linear electron transfer ({LET}), is pivotal for cyclic electron transfer ({CET}) and plays a key role as a redox-sensing hub involved in the regulation of light-harvesting, electron transfer and photosynthetic gene expression. Together, these characteristics make cytb6f a judicious target for genetic manipulation to enhance photosynthetic yield, a strategy which already shows promise. In this review we will outline the structure and function of cytb6f with a particular focus on new insights provided by the recent high-resolution map of the complex from Spinach.},

Yet, it remains unclear how changing grana size benefits photosynthesis and whether these two regulatory mechanisms function independently. Here, by comparing Arabidopsis wild-type, stn7 and tap38 plants with the psal mutant, which undergoes dynamic thylakoid stacking but lacks state transitions, we explain their distinct roles. Under low light, smaller grana increase the rate of {PSI} reduction and photosynthesis by reducing the diffusion distance for plastoquinol; however, this beneficial effect is only apparent when {PSI}/{PSII} excitation balance is maintained by state transitions or far-red light. Under high light, the larger grana slow plastoquinol diffusion and lower the equilibrium constant between plastocyanin and {PSI}, maximizing photosynthesis by avoiding {PSI} photoinhibition. Loss of state transitions in low light or maintenance of smaller grana in high light also both bring about a decrease in cyclic electron transfer and over-reduction of the {PSI} acceptor side. These results demonstrate that state transitions and dynamic thylakoid stacking work synergistically to regulate photosynthesis in variable light.},

Absorption of light that exceeds a plant's capacity for fixation of {CO}2 results in thermal dissipation of excitation energy in the pigment antenna of photosystem {II} by a poorly understood mechanism. This regulatory process, termed nonphotochemical quenching, maintains the balance between dissipation and utilization of light energy to minimize generation of oxidizing molecules, thereby protecting the plant against photo-oxidative damage. To identify specific proteins that are involved in nonphotochemical quenching, we have isolated mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana that cannot dissipate excess absorbed light energy. Here we show that the gene encoding {PsbS}, an intrinsic chlorophyll-binding protein of photosystem {II}, is necessary for nonphotochemical quenching but not for efficient light harvesting and photosynthesis. These results indicate that {PsbS} may be the site for nonphotochemical quenching, a finding that has implications for the functional evolution of pigment-binding proteins.},

However, the dependence of {FLIM} data on input laser power has not been quantitatively explained by absolute excitation probabilities under actual imaging conditions. In an effort to distinguish between photosystem I and photosystem {II} ({PSI} and {PSII}) in microscopic images, we have obtained dependence of {FLIM} data on input laser power from a filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis and single cellular green alga Parachlorella kessleri. Nitrogen-fixing cells in A. variabilis, heterocysts, are mostly visualized as cells in which short-lived fluorescence (≤0.1 ns) characteristic of {PSI} is predominant. The other cells in A. variabilis (vegetative cells) and P. kessleri cells show a transition in the status of {PSII} from an open state with the maximal charge separation rate at a weak excitation limit to a closed state in which charge separation is temporarily prohibited by previous excitation(s) at a relatively high laser power. This transition is successfully reproduced by a computer simulation with a high fidelity to the actual imaging conditions. More details in the fluorescence from heterocysts were examined to assess possible functions of {PSII} in the anaerobic environment inside the heterocysts for the nitrogen-fixing enzyme, nitrogenase. Photochemically active {PSII}:{PSI} ratio in heterocysts is tentatively estimated to be typically below our detection limit or at most about 5\% in limited heterocysts in comparison with that in vegetative cells.},

These provide the {ATP} and {NADPH} required for the fixation of {CO}2 into biomass by the Calvin-Benson cycle and a range of other metabolic reactions in the stroma. Land plants are frequently challenged by fluctuations in their environment, such as light, nutrient and water availability, which can create a mismatch between the amounts of {ATP} and {NADPH} produced and the amounts required by the downstream metabolism. Left unchecked, such imbalances can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species that damage the plant and harm productivity. Fortunately, plants have evolved a complex range of regulatory processes to avoid or minimize such deleterious effects by controlling the efficiency of light harvesting and electron transfer in the thylakoid membrane. Generally the regulation of the light reactions has been studied and conceptualised at the microscopic level of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, however in recent years dynamic changes in the thylakoid macrostructure itself have been recognised to play a significant role in regulating light harvesting and electron transfer. Here we review the evidence for the involvement of macrostructural changes in photosynthetic regulation and review the techniques that brought this evidence to light.},

	abstract = {Non-photochemical quenching ({NPQ}) is an important photoprotective mechanism in plants and algae. Although the process is extensively studied, little is known about its relationship with ultrastructural changes of the thylakoid membranes. In order to better understand this relationship, we studied the effects of illumination on the organization of thylakoid membranes in Monstera deliciosa leaves. This evergreen species is known to exhibit very large {NPQ} and to possess giant grana with dozens of stacked thylakoids. It is thus ideally suited for small-angle neutron scattering measurements ({SANS})—a non-invasive technique, which is capable of providing spatially and statistically averaged information on the periodicity of the thylakoid membranes and their rapid reorganizations in vivo. We show that {NPQ}-inducing illumination causes a strong decrease in the periodic order of granum thylakoid membranes. Development of {NPQ} and light-induced ultrastructural changes, as well as the relaxation processes, follow similar kinetic patterns. Surprisingly, whereas {NPQ} is suppressed by diuron, it impedes only the relaxation of the structural changes and not its formation, suggesting that structural changes do not cause but enable {NPQ}. We also demonstrate that the diminishment of {SANS} peak does not originate from light-induced redistribution and reorientation of chloroplasts inside the cells.},

These provide the {ATP} and {NADPH} required for the fixation of {CO}2 into biomass by the Calvin-Benson cycle and a range of other metabolic reactions in the stroma. Land plants are frequently challenged by fluctuations in their environment, such as light, nutrient and water availability, which can create a mismatch between the amounts of {ATP} and {NADPH} produced and the amounts required by the downstream metabolism. Left unchecked, such imbalances can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species that damage the plant and harm productivity. Fortunately, plants have evolved a complex range of regulatory processes to avoid or minimize such deleterious effects by controlling the efficiency of light harvesting and electron transfer in the thylakoid membrane. Generally the regulation of the light reactions has been studied and conceptualised at the microscopic level of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions, however in recent years dynamic changes in the thylakoid macrostructure itself have been recognised to play a significant role in regulating light harvesting and electron transfer. Here we review the evidence for the involvement of macrostructural changes in photosynthetic regulation and review the techniques that brought this evidence to light.},

	abstract = {The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis take place in the plant chloroplast thylakoid membrane, a complex three-dimensional structure divided into the stacked grana and unstacked stromal lamellae domains. Plants regulate the macro-organization of photosynthetic complexes within the thylakoid membrane to adapt to changing environmental conditions and avoid oxidative stress. One such mechanism is the state transition that regulates photosynthetic light harvesting and electron transfer. State transitions are driven by changes in the phosphorylation of light harvesting complex {II} ({LHCII}), which cause a decrease in grana diameter and stacking, a decrease in energetic connectivity between photosystem {II} ({PSII}) reaction centers, and an increase in the relative {LHCII} antenna size of photosystem I ({PSI}) compared to {PSII}. Phosphorylation is believed to drive these changes by weakening the intramembrane lateral {PSII}-{LHCII} and {LHCII}-{LHCII} interactions and the intermembrane stacking interactions between these complexes, while simultaneously increasing the affinity of {LHCII} for {PSI}. We investigated the relative roles and contributions of these three types of interaction to state transitions using a lattice-based model of the thylakoid membrane based on existing structural data, developing a novel algorithm to simulate protein complex dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that state transitions are unlikely to lead to a large-scale migration of {LHCII} from the grana to the stromal lamellae. Instead, the increased light harvesting capacity of {PSI} is largely due to the more efficient recruitment of {LHCII} already residing in the stromal lamellae into {PSI}-{LHCII} supercomplexes upon its phosphorylation. Likewise, the increased light harvesting capacity of {PSII} upon dephosphorylation was found to be driven by a more efficient recruitment of {LHCII} already residing in the grana into functional {PSII}-{LHCII} clusters, primarily driven by lateral interactions.},

The flexible design of {LHCII} underlies a photoprotective mechanism whereby this complex switches to a dissipative state in response to high light stress, allowing the rapid dissipation of excess excitation energy (non-photochemical quenching, {NPQ}). In this work, we locked single {LHCII} trimers in a quenched conformation after immobilization of the complexes in polyacrylamide gels to impede protein interactions. A comparison of their pigment excited-state dynamics with quenched {LHCII} aggregates in buffer revealed the presence of a new spectral band at 515 nm arising after chlorophyll excitation. This is suggested to be the signature of a carotenoid excited state, linked to the quenching of chlorophyll singlet excited states. Our data highlight the marked sensitivity of pigment excited-state dynamics in {LHCII} to structural changes induced by the environment.},

	abstract = {Photosystem {II} ({PSII}) uses light energy to split water into protons, electrons, and oxygen, ultimately sustaining heterotrophic life on Earth. The major light harvesting complex in plants ({LHCII}) is packed with chlorophylls and carotenoids and is the main supplier of excitation energy to {PSII} reaction centers. The protein scaffold acts as a programmed solvent for the pigments in {LHCII}, tuning their orientations while at the same time impeding concentration quenching to ensure efficient storage of excitation energy by chlorophylls. However, under stress, the very fuel of {PSII}, solar photons, can damage its delicate inner components and hamper photosynthesis. In a crucial regulatory strategy in plants, {LHCII} evolved a flexible design that allows it to switch between light-harvesting and dissipative conformations, thereby safely releasing the excess energy that is absorbed into heat. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain chlorophyll de-excitation pathways in {LHCII}, such as chlorophyll–chlorophyll charge transfer states, resonance energy transfer from chlorophylls to a carotenoid S1 state, and chlorophyll–carotenoid reductive energy transfer. This Perspective critically assesses the listed proposals, addressing both the physical mechanism of quenching and the nature of the quenching pigment. These hypotheses are then discussed in the context of state-of-the-art biochemical, physiological, and genetic knowledge to scrutinize their likeliness to occur in the native thylakoid membranes.},

When the photosynthetic machinery is exposed to high light, photons are absorbed in excess, potentially leading to oxidative damage of its delicate membrane components. A photoprotective molecular process called non-photochemical quenching ({NPQ}) is the fastest response carried out in the thylakoid membranes to harmlessly dissipate excess light energy. Despite having been intensely studied, the site and mechanism of this essential regulatory process are still debated. Here, we show that the main {NPQ} component called energy-dependent quenching ({qE}) is present in plants with photosynthetic membranes largely enriched in the major trimeric light-harvesting complex ({LHC}) {II}, while being deprived of all minor {LHCs} and most photosystem core proteins. This fast and reversible quenching depends upon thylakoid lumen acidification (Δ{pH}). Enhancing Δ{pH} amplifies the extent of the quenching and restores {qE} in the membranes lacking {PSII} subunit S protein ({PsbS}), whereas the carotenoid zeaxanthin modulates the kinetics and amplitude of the quenching. These findings highlight the self-regulatory properties of the photosynthetic light-harvesting membranes in vivo, where the ability to switch reversibly between the harvesting and dissipative states is an intrinsic property of the major {LHCII}.},

In this study, we show induction of the energy dissipation state, monitored by chlorophyll fluorescence quenching, in the isolated major light-harvesting complex ({LHCII}) incorporated into a solid gel system. Removal of detergent caused strong fluorescence quenching, which was totally reversible. Singlet-singlet annihilation and gel electrophoresis experiments suggested that the quenched complexes were in the trimeric not aggregated state. Both the formation and recovery of this quenching state were inhibited by a cross-linker, implying involvement of conformational changes. Absorption and {CD} measurements performed on the samples in the quenched state revealed specific alterations in the spectral bands assigned to the red forms of chlorophyll a, neoxanthin, and lutein 1 molecules. The majority of these alterations were similar to those observed during {LHCII} aggregation. This suggests that not the aggregation process as such but rather an intrinsic conformational transition in the complex is responsible for establishment of quenching. 77 K fluorescence measurements showed red-shifted chlorophyll a fluorescence in the 690-705 nm region, previously observed in aggregated {LHCII}. The fact that all spectral changes associated with the dissipative mode observed in the gel were different from those of the partially denatured complex strongly argues against the involvement of protein denaturation in the observed quenching. The implications of these findings for proposed mechanisms of energy dissipation in the Photosystem {II} antenna are discussed.},

Recently, it has been shown that efficient energy dissipation can be induced in the major light-harvesting complexes of photosystem {II} ({LHCII}) in the absence of protein-protein interactions. Spectroscopic measurements on these samples ({LHCII} gels) in the quenched state revealed specific alterations in the absorption and circular dichroism bands assigned to neoxanthin and lutein 1 molecules. In this work, we investigate the changes in conformation of the pigments involved in {NPQ} using resonance Raman spectroscopy. By selective excitation we show that, as well as the twisting of neoxanthin that has been reported previously, the lutein 1 pigment also undergoes a significant change in conformation when {LHCII} switches to the energy dissipative state. Selective two-photon excitation of carotenoid (Car) dark states (Car S1) performed on {LHCII} gels shows that the extent of electronic interactions between Car S1 and chlorophyll states correlates linearly with chlorophyll fluorescence quenching, as observed previously for isolated {LHCII} (aggregated versus trimeric) and whole plants (with versus without {NPQ}).},

	abstract = {Photosystem {II} ({PSII}) of photosynthesis catalyzes one of the most challenging reactions in nature, the light driven oxidation of water and release of molecular oxygen. {PSII} couples the sequential four step oxidation of water and two step reduction of plastoquinone to single photon photochemistry with charge accumulation centers on both its electron donor and acceptor sides. Photon capture, excitation energy transfer, and trapping occur on a much faster time scale than the subsequent electron transfer and charge accumulation steps. A balance between excitation of {PSII} and the use of the absorbed energy to drive electron transport is essential. If the absorption of light energy increases and/or the sink capacity for photosynthetically derived electrons decreases, potentially deleterious side reactions may occur, including the production of reactive oxygen species. In response, a myriad of fast (second to minutes timescale) and reversible photoprotective mechanisms are observed to regulate {PSII} excitation when the environment changes more quickly than can be acclimated to by gene expression. This review compares the diverse photoprotective mechanisms that are used to dissipate (quench) {PSII} excitation within the antenna systems of higher land plants, green algae, diatoms, and cyanobacteria. The molecular bases of how {PSII} excitation pressure is sensed by the antenna system and how the antenna then reconfigures itself from a light harvesting to an energy dissipative mode are discussed.},

	abstract = {Photoprotective nonphotochemical quenching ({NPQ}) of absorbed solar energy is vital for survival of photosynthetic organisms, and {NPQ} modifications significantly improve plant productivity. However, the exact {NPQ} quenching mechanism is obscured by discrepancies between reported mechanisms, involving xanthophyll–chlorophyll (Xan–Chl) and Chl–Chl interactions. We present evidence of an experimental artifact that may explain the discrepancies: strong laser pulses lead to the formation of a novel electronic species in the major plant light-harvesting complex ({LHCII}). This species evolves from a high excited state of Chl a and is absent with weak laser pulses. It resembles an excitonically coupled heterodimer of Chl a and lutein (or other Xans at site L1) and acts as a de-excitation channel. Laser powers, and consequently amounts of artifact, vary strongly between {NPQ} studies, thereby explaining contradicting spectral signatures attributed to {NPQ}. Our results offer pathways toward unveiling {NPQ} mechanisms and highlight the necessity of careful attention to laser-induced artifacts.},

	abstract = {Phycobilisome ({PBS}) structures are elaborate antennae in cyanobacteria and red algae1,2. These large protein complexes capture incident sunlight and transfer the energy through a network of embedded pigment molecules called bilins to the photosynthetic reaction centres. However, light harvesting must also be balanced against the risks of photodamage. A known mode of photoprotection is mediated by orange carotenoid protein ({OCP}), which binds to {PBS} when light intensities are high to mediate photoprotective, non-photochemical quenching3–6. Here we use cryogenic electron microscopy to solve four structures of the 6.2 {MDa} {PBS}, with and without {OCP} bound, from the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. {PCC} 6803. The structures contain a previously undescribed linker protein that binds to the membrane-facing side of {PBS}. For the unquenched {PBS}, the structures also reveal three different conformational states of the antenna, two previously unknown. The conformational states result from positional switching of two of the rods and may constitute a new mode of regulation of light harvesting. Only one of the three {PBS} conformations can bind to {OCP}, which suggests that not every {PBS} is equally susceptible to non-photochemical quenching. In the {OCP}–{PBS} complex, quenching is achieved through the binding of four 34 {kDa} {OCPs} organized as two dimers. The complex reveals the structure of the active form of {OCP}, in which an approximately 60 Å displacement of its regulatory carboxy terminal domain occurs. Finally, by combining our structure with spectroscopic properties7, we elucidate energy transfer pathways within {PBS} in both the quenched and light-harvesting states. Collectively, our results provide detailed insights into the biophysical underpinnings of the control of cyanobacterial light harvesting. The data also have implications for bioengineering {PBS} regulation in natural and artificial light-harvesting systems.},

We discuss the current knowledge and unknown aspects in the {NPQ} scenario, including the following: Ɗ{pH}, the proton gradient (trigger); light-harvesting complex {II} ({LHCII}), {PSII} light harvesting antenna (site); and changes in the antenna induced by Ɗ{pH} (change), which lead to the creation of the quencher. We conclude that the minimum requirements for {NPQ} in vivo are Ɗ{pH}, {LHCII} complexes, and the {PsbS} protein. We highlight the most important unknown in the {NPQ} scenario, the mechanism by which {PsbS} acts upon the {LHCII} antenna.

The protein displays a rich spectrum of interactions, both between pigments and between the pigments and the protein, and these interactions have been studied with a multitude of different techniques. In this article we present an overview of the most important experimental results that have become available over the past decade and relate these to the structural knowledge. Emphasis will be put on the pigment identities, their spectroscopic features, and the interactions between the pigments, which determine both steady-state (polarized) properties and singlet and triplet energy transfer dynamics.

	abstract = {Even though light is the source of energy for photosynthesis, it can also be harmful to plants. Light-induced damage is targetted mainly to Photosystem {II} and leads to inactivation of electron transport and subsequent oxidative damage of the reaction centre, in particular to the D1 protein. Inactivation and protein damage can be induced by two different mechanisms, either from the acceptor side or from donor side of P680. The damaged D1 protein is triggered for degradation and digested by at least one serine-type proteinase that is tightly associated with the Photosystem {II} complex itself. The damaged Photosystem {II} complex dissociates from the light-harvesting antenna and migrates from appressed to non-appressed thylakoid regions where a new D1 protein is co-translationally inserted into the partially disassembled Photosystem {II} complex. D1 protein phosphorylation probably allows for coordinated biodegradation and biosynthesis of the D1 protein. After religation of cofactors and assembly of subunits, the repaired Photosystem {II} complex can again be found in the appressed membrane regions. Various protective mechanisms and an efficient repair cycle of Photosystem {II} allow plants to survive light stress.},

In full sunlight though, the problem is rather different. When there is too much light it becomes necessary to ‘lose’ some of the Sun's energy in order to avoid bleaching damage. Little is known about the mechanism of the safety valve involved, but now it has been established that the atomic structure of the major plant light-harvesting antenna protein, published in Nature recently (428, 287–292; 2004), was in fact that of the molecule in a dissipative energy-wasting state. Armed with that knowledge and a spectroscopic analysis of the protein crystal, it is now possible to see how this protein, {LHCII}, changes the configuration of its pigment array in response to changes in light intensity. This has implications not just for improving the resistance of crops to stress but also for design of novel nano-optical devices.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Under excess illumination, the Photosystem {II} light-harvesting antenna of higher plants has the ability to switch into an efficient photoprotective mode, allowing safe dissipation of excitation energy into heat. In this study, we show induction of the energy dissipation state, monitored by chlorophyll fluorescence quenching, in the isolated major light-harvesting complex ({LHCII}) incorporated into a solid gel system. Removal of detergent caused strong fluorescence quenching, which was totally reversible. Singlet-singlet annihilation and gel electrophoresis experiments suggested that the quenched complexes were in the trimeric not aggregated state. Both the formation and recovery of this quenching state were inhibited by a cross-linker, implying involvement of conformational changes. Absorption and {CD} measurements performed on the samples in the quenched state revealed specific alterations in the spectral bands assigned to the red forms of chlorophyll \textit{a}, neoxanthin, and lutein 1 molecules. The majority of these alterations were similar to those observed during {LHCII} aggregation. This suggests that not the aggregation process as such but rather an intrinsic conformational transition in the complex is responsible for establishment of quenching. 77 K fluorescence measurements showed red-shifted chlorophyll \textit{a} fluorescence in the 690-705 nm region, previously observed in aggregated {LHCII}. The fact that all spectral changes associated with the dissipative mode observed in the gel were different from those of the partially denatured complex strongly argues against the involvement of protein denaturation in the observed quenching. The implications of these findings for proposed mechanisms of energy dissipation in the Photosystem {II} antenna are discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The light-harvesting complex {II} ({LHCII}) is the main responsible for light absorption in plants and green algae and is involved in photoprotective mechanisms that regulate the amount of excited states in the membrane. The dual function of {LHCII} has been extensively studied in detergent micelles, but recent results have indicated that the properties of this complex differ in a lipid environment. In this work we checked these suggestions by studying {LHCII} in liposomes. By combining bulk and single molecule measurements, we monitored the fluorescence characteristics of liposomes containing single complexes up to densely packed proteoliposomes. We show that the natural lipid environment \textit{per se} does not alter the properties of {LHCII}, which for single complexes remain very similar to that in detergent. However, we show that {LHCII} has the strong tendency to cluster in the membrane and that protein interactions and the extent of crowding modulate the lifetimes of the excited state in the membrane. Finally, the presence of {LHCII} monomers at low concentrations of complexes per liposome is discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Yet, little is known about the effect of the quencher on chlorophyll excited state energy and dynamics. Application of picosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated that {NPQ} involves a red-shift (60 ± 5 cm$^{\textrm{−1}}$) and slight enhancement of the vibronic satellite of the main {PSII} lifetime component present in intact chloroplasts. Whereas this fluorescence red-shift was enhanced by the presence of zeaxanthin, it was not dependent upon it. The red-shifted fluorescence of intact chloroplasts in the {NPQ} state was accompanied by red-shifted chlorophyll \textit{a} absorption. Nearly identical absorption and fluorescence changes were observed in isolated {LHCII} complexes quenched in a low detergent media, suggesting that the mechanism of quenching is the same in both systems. In both cases, the extent of the fluorescence red-shift was shown to correlate with the lifetime of a component. The alteration in the energy of the emitting chlorophyll(s) in intact chloroplasts and isolated {LHCII} was also accompanied by changes in lutein 1 observed in their 77K fluorescence excitation spectra. We suggest that the characteristic red-shifted fluorescence emission reflects an altered environment of the emitting chlorophyll(s) in {LHCII} brought about by their closer interaction with lutein 1 in the quenching locus.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
