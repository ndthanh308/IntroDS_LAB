  "abstract": "We compare recent MINERvA antineutrino-hydrogen charged-current measurements to phenomenological predictions of the axial-vector form factor based on fits to all available electron scattering and deuterium bubble-chamber data and to representative lattice-QCD (LQCD) determination by the PNDME Collaboration. While there is $1$--$2σ$ agreement in the cross section with MINERvA data for each bin in $Q^2$, we identify three regions with different relevance and opportunity for LQCD predictions. For $Q^2 \\lesssim 0.2~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$, the phenomenological extractions have large number of data points and LQCD is competitive, while MINERvA data have large errors. For $0.2~\\mathrm{GeV}^2 \\lesssim Q^2 \\lesssim 1~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$, LQCD is competitive with the MINERvA determination, and both give values larger than from phenomenological extraction. For $Q^2 > 1~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$, the MINERvA data are the most precise. Our analysis indicates that with improving precision of MINERvA-like experiments and LQCD data, the uncertainty in the nucleon axial-vector form factor will be steadily reduced.",
