  "abstract": "We propose a linguistic interpretation of three-way decisions, where the regions of acceptance, rejection, and non-commitment are constructed by using the so-called evaluative linguistic expressions, which are expressions of natural language such as small, medium, very short, quite roughly strong, extremely good, etc. Our results highlight new connections between two different research areas: three-way decisions and the theory of evaluative linguistic expressions.",
