  "abstract": "Working in the category of smooth projective varieties over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0, we review notions of ampleness and numerical nefness for Higgs bundles which \"feel\" the Higgs field and formulate criteria of the Barton-Kleiman type for these notions. We give an application to minimal surfaces of general type that saturate the Miyaoka-Yau inequality, showing that their cotangent bundle is ample. This will use results by Langer that imply that also for varieties over algebraically closed field of characteristic zero the so-called Simpson system is stable.",
