% {An overview of \vispur system. (A) The {\bf \confounderdashboard} allows selecting cause and outcome, ranking remaining covariates and displaying the comparison of distributions across treatment arms to assist users in selecting confounders. (B) The {\bf \partition} supports both manual and automated subgroup generation by either allowing users to specify partition rules (manual) or algorithm parameters (auto). (C) The {\bf \subgroupviewer} contains two separate spaces: {\causalityspace} (C-1 for binary treatment, C-2 for continuous treatment) and {\covariatespace} (C-3), where the former demonstrates subgroups' causal/assocaitional properties such as {\it propensity}, {\it base effect}, as well as cause-outcome {\it association} for generated subgroups, while the latter space displays a set of radar-shaped glyphs for subgroups which encode the median values of selected features. (D) The {\bf \reasoningstoryboard} allows users to select and compare subgroups of interest by investigating story flows from treatment actions to outcome status. (E) The {\bf \decisiondiagnosis} reports the detailed subgroup-level statistics in {\basicstatistics} (E-1) and {\imbalancechart} (E-2) for a selected subgroup. It pops out warning messages to alert users about the presence of confounding bias and association distortion.}
