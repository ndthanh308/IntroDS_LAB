@article{Zhang2007,
abstract = {Just as we can work with two-dimensional floor plans to communicate 3D architectural design, we can exploit reduceddimension shadows to manipulate the higher-dimensional objects generating the shadows. In particular, by taking advantage of physically reactive 3D shadow-space controllers, we can transform the task of interacting with 4D objects to a new level of physical reality. We begin with a teaching tool that uses 2D knot diagrams to manipulate the geometry of 3D mathematical knots via their projections; our unique 2D haptic interface allows the user to become familiar with sketching, editing, exploration, and manipulation of 3D knots rendered as projected images on a 2D shadow space. By combining graphics and collision-sensing haptics, we can enhance the 2D shadow-driven editing protocol to successfully leverage 2D pen-and-paper or blackboard skills. Building on the reduced-dimension 2D editing tool for manipulating 3D shapes, we develop the natural analogy to produce a reduced-dimension 3D tool for manipulating 4D shapes. By physically modeling the correct properties of 4D surfaces, their bending forces, and their collisions in the 3D haptic controller interface, we can support full-featured physical exploration of 4D mathematical objects in a manner that is otherwise far beyond the experience accessible to human beings. As far as we are aware, this paper reports the first interactive system with force-feedback that provides "4D haptic visualization" permitting the user to model and interact with 4D cloth-like objects. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

@article{Ohori2017,
abstract = {Objects of more than three dimensions can be used to model geographic phenomena that occur in space, time and scale. For instance, a single 4D object can be used to represent the changes in a 3D object's shape across time or all its optimal representations at various levels of detail. In this paper, we look at how such higher-dimensional space-time and space-scale objects can be visualised as projections from ℝ 4 to ℝ 3 . We present three projections that we believe are particularly intuitive for this purpose: (i) a simple ‘long axis' projection that puts 3D objects side by side; (ii) the well-known orthographic and perspective projections; and (iii) a projection to a 3-sphere ( S 3 ) followed by a stereographic projection to ℝ 3 , which results in an inwards-outwards fourth axis. Our focus is in using these projections from ℝ 4 to ℝ 3 , but they are formulated from ℝ n to ℝ n −1 so as to be easily extensible and to incorporate other non-spatial characteristics. We present a prototype interactive visualiser that applies these projections from 4D to 3D in real-time using the programmable pipeline and compute shaders of the Metal graphics API.},

abstract = {A mapping between circles on a 3-sphere and points on a 2-sphere is well known by topologists as the Hopf fibration. While the 2-sphere is embedded in a 3-space, to visualize the 3-sphere, the 4-dimensional Euclidean space is needed. Visualizations using computer graphics based on their analytic representations became popular in the last decades. Instead, for purely synthetic constructions, we apply the recently introduced method of visualization of the 4-space by its double orthogonal projection onto two mutually perpendicular 3-spaces to investigate the Hopf fibration as a four-dimensional relation without analogy in lower dimensions. In this paper, the method of double orthogonal projection is used for a direct synthetic construction of the fibers of a 3-sphere from the corresponding points on a 2-sphere. The fibers of great circles on the 2-sphere create nested tori visualized in a stereographic projection into the modeling 3-space. The step-by-step construction is supplemented by interactive 3D models showing simultaneously the 3-sphere, 2-sphere, and stereographic images of the fibers and mutual interrelations. Each step of the synthetic construction is supported by its analytic representation to highlight connections between both interpretations.},

abstract = {Introduced 160 years ago as an attempt to generalize complex numbers to higher dimensions, quaternions are now recognized as one of the most important concepts in modern computer graphics. They offer a powerful way to represent rotations and compared to rotation matrices they use less memory, compose faster, and are naturally suited for efficient interpolation of rotations. Despite this, many practitioners have avoided quaternions because of the mathematics used to understand them, hoping that some day a more intuitive description will be available. The wait is over. Andrew Hanson's new book is a fresh perspective on quaternions. The first part of the book focuses on visualizing quaternions to provide the intuition necessary to use them, and includes many illustrative examples to motivate why they are important--a beautiful introduction to those wanting to explore quaternions unencumbered by their mathematical aspects. The second part covers the all-important advanced applications, including quaternion curves, surfaces, and volumes. Finally, for those wanting the full story of the mathematics behind quaternions, there is a gentle introduction to their four-dimensional nature and to Clifford Algebras, the all-encompassing framework for vectors and quaternions.},

A synthetic approach, with the use of basic descriptive geometry tools of Monge's projection in interactive 3D graphical software, is taken. Descriptive constructions of projections of points, lines, planes and three-dimensional spaces are shown. Methods of measuring true lengths of segments and rotating projections of objects into the modeling space are described. The focus lies on improving the spatial ability and understanding of the four-dimensional space. An example of a construction is carried out on a model of tesseract. All the constructions are analogies of constructions in Monge's projection of a three-dimensional space. With advantages of interactive computer graphics, the constructions are easy to perform, and objects are easy to manipulate with.},

abstract = {1. FROM PARIAH TO PANACEA? To draw attention to a philosophers metaphors is to belittle him like praising a logician for his beautiful handwriting. Addiction to metaphor is held to be illicit, on the principle that whereof one can speak only metaphorically, thereof one ought not to speak at all. do not accept the commandment, Thou shalt not commit metaphor or assume that metaphor is incompatible with serious thought. (Black, 1962, p.25) How far we have come! Since the mid-twentieth century, philosophers have accepted that metaphor and analogy permeate all discourse, are fundamental to human thought and provide a basis for mental leaps (see Black, 1962; Goswami, 1992; Johnson, 1981; Lakoff & Johnson 1980; Sch{\"{o}}n, 1983). Similarly, the potential contribution of metaphor and analogy to cognitive learning (e.g., in schools) has attracted the attention of the science education research community (Gentner & Stevens, 1983). The first important revelation is that metaphor is not merely a linguistic phenomenon. It also is a fundamental principle of thought and action (see Johnson, 1981). The second revelation is that analogies are more specific than metaphors and, despite their wide use in everyday communication and reasoning, their use in teaching is often problematic because the applicability of specific analogies not negotiated with students. Consequently, researchers have and are interested in the form and function of analogy and metaphor in learning and teaching science. These philosophical and educational origins of metaphor and analogy have spawned a significant literature and cognitive theories. These have the potential to enhance science teaching and learning; promote higher-level thinking; and yield new tools for interpreting science education research. To achieve these aims, the book brings together powerful ideas and new developments from international scholars of metaphor and analogy in science education. It also offers theoretical and practical perspectives on metaphor and analogy that should promote concept learning, metacognition and communication. The books first theme is the ubiquity of metaphor and how metaphors can help people explore their epistemological and ontological commitments. Metaphoric thinking helps teachers (re)conceptualise their role and practice and it can promote professional reflection, action research and educational renewal. These benefits are intrinsically tied to the metaphors we live by because metaphor enables us to conceptualise our experiences and to pick out what is important in the experience and categorise the experience dimension by dimension (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, p.83, 145). Metaphors have entailments that suggest a range of new ideas, applications and possibilities; this is what makes metaphor a creative tool for looking inwards and for critiquing accepted ideas. The second theme is analogical thinking as it applies to concept description and explanation and the book explores the theory and use of analogies in classrooms and discusses a range of popular instructional analogies. Analogy is attractive because it},

abstract = {Making accurate computer graphics representations of surfaces and volumes (2-manifolds and 3-manifolds) embedded in four-dimensional space typically involves complex and time-consuming computations. In order to make simulated worlds that help develop human intuition about the fourth dimension, we need techniques that permit real-time, interactive manipulation of the most sophisticated depictions available. We propose the following new methods that bring us significantly closer to this goal: an approach to high-speed 4D illuminated surface rendering incorporating 4D shading and occlusion coding; a procedure for rapidly generating 2D screen images of tessellated 3-manifolds illuminated by 4D light. These methods are orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches, enabling the real-time manipulation of high-resolution 4D images on commercial graphics hardware.},

abstract = {The fourth dimension, whilst contemplated from as far back as antiquity, was only studied in mathematics from the nineteenth century. Here we trace the history of these investigations, and place them in the context of their manifestations in architecture, whether real or imagined. As we take a look at the social milieu within which the study of the fourth dimension flourished, in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, we investigate the biographies and works of the protagonists, and note that the study of the fourth dimension, and dimensionality itself, was strongly coloured by considerations of ethics and even religiosity. Finally we look at a few examples of architecture which offer different interpretations of the fourth dimension.},

Under the hopf-fibration the parameter space of the quaternion separates into an intrinsic and extrinsic parameter space, and accounts for the intrinsic and extrinsic spin of the fundamental particles. The intrinsic parameter space is the global, geometric and dynamic phases which are presented in this article in full generality. The equivalence between the quantum and classical equations of motion is established, and the global phase of the quaternion is shown to be a natural hidden variable which deterministically accounts for the results of the Stern-Gerlach experiment.},

abstract = {To uncover the underlying control structure of three-ball cascade juggling, we studied its spatiotemporal properties in detail. Juggling patterns, performed at fast and preferred speeds, were recorded in the frontal plane and subsequently analyzed using principal component analysis and serial correlation techniques. As was expected on theoretical grounds, the principal component analysis revealed that maximally four instead of the original six dimensions (3 balls x 2 planar coordinates) are sufficient for describing the juggling dynamics. Juggling speed was shown to affect the number of dimensions (four for the fast condition, two for the preferred condition) as well as the smoothness of the time evolution of the eigenvectors of the principal component analysis, particularly around the catches. Contrary to the throws and the zeniths, and regardless of juggling speed, consecutive catches of the same hand showed a markedly negative lag-one serial correlation, suggesting that the catches are timed so as to preserve the temporal integrity of the juggling act.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental questions of a three-dimensional geometer is how to imagine a four-dimensional object. And yet, he draws pictures of three-dimensional objects in the two-dimensional paper. Moreover, would a two-dimensional geometer understand our sketches? Based on analogies, we give an overview of methods of examination of four-dimensional objects. We emphasize visualization as the main element of perception of four-dimensional space. For this purpose, we describe the double orthogonal projection of the four-dimensional space onto two mutually perpendicular three-dimensional spaces as a generalization of the classical Monge's projection. In such a projection, we construct a four-dimensional playground for convenient synthetic creation of four-dimensional objects. All our constructions are easily accessible with the interactive 3D modeling software GeoGebra. Furthermore, we apply the method of projection to an intuitive investigation of various four-dimensional mathematical phenomena – polytopes, four-dimensional quadrics, three-sphere and its stereographic projection, complex plane, and the Hopf fibration.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020, arXiv, All rights reserved. A mapping between circles on a 3-sphere and points on a 2-sphere is well known by topologists as the Hopf fibration. While the 2-sphere is embedded in a 3-space, to visualize the 3-sphere, the 4-dimensional Euclidean space is needed. Visualizations using computer graphics based on their analytic representations became popular in the last decades. Instead, for purely synthetic constructions, we apply the recently introduced method of visualization of the 4-space by its double orthogonal projection onto two mutually perpendicular 3-spaces to investigate the Hopf fibration as a four-dimensional relation without analogy in lower dimensions. In this paper, the method of double orthogonal projection is used for a direct synthetic construction of the fibers of a 3-sphere from the corresponding points on a 2-sphere. The fibers of great circles on the 2-sphere create nested tori visualized in a stereographic projection into the modeling 3-space. The step-by-step construction is supplemented by interactive 3D models showing simultaneously the 3-sphere, 2-sphere, and stereographic images of the fibers and mutual interrelations. Each step of the synthetic construction is supported by its analytic representation to highlight connections between both interpretations.MSC Codes 51N05 (Primary) 55R10 65D17 (Secondary)},

The mathematical model of inside and outside throws is made from an empirical observation of trajectories of balls. Braids of juggling sequences and their attributes are provided using a real model of ladder. A sketch of the proof of the theorem that any braid is juggleable is given as well.},

@book{Henderson1983,
abstract = {Revised edition. In this groundbreaking study, first published in 1983 and unavailable for over a decade, Linda Dalrymple Henderson demonstrates that two concepts of space beyond immediate perception - the curved spaces of non-Euclidean geometry and, most important, a higher, fourth dimension of space - were central to the development of modern art. The possibility of a spatial fourth dimension suggested that our world might be merely a shadow or section of a higher dimensional existence. That iconoclastic idea encouraged radical innovation by a variety of early twentieth-century artists, ranging from French Cubists, Italian Futurists, and Marcel Duchamp, to Max Weber, Kazimir Malevich, and the artists of De Stijl and Surrealism. In an extensive new Reintroduction, Henderson surveys the impact of interest in higher dimensions of space in art and culture from the 1950s to 2000. Although largely eclipsed by relativity theory beginning in the 1920s, the spatial fourth dimension experienced a resurgence during the later 1950s and 1960s. In a remarkable turn of events, it has returned as an important theme in contemporary culture in the wake of the emergence in the 1980s of both string theory in physics (with its ten- or eleven-dimensional universes) and computer graphics. Henderson demonstrates the importance of this new conception of space for figures ranging from Buckminster Fuller, Robert Smithson, and the Park Place Gallery group in the 1960s to Tony Robbin and digital architect Marcos Novak. -- Publishers website.

abstract = {In this paper, for the first time, a complete analysis of the reachable workspace of a spatial Stewart—Gough platform with planar base and platform (SGPP) is presented. The devised workspace algorithms are applied to a commercial 6–6 design. Major importance is given to the visualization of the results of this workspace analysis to provide fast information to the designer on the overall kinematic behaviour of the designed mechanism. Furthermore, it is shown that the reachable workspace also gives the necessary information on how to construct a building enclosing all motion instances of an actual hexapod design.},

@article{Chu2009,
abstract = {This paper describes GL4D, an interactive system for visualizing 2-manifolds and 3-manifolds embedded in four Euclidean dimensions and illuminated by 4D light sources. It is a tetrahedron-based rendering pipeline that projects geometry into volume images, an exact parallel to the conventional triangle-based rendering pipeline for 3D graphics. Novel features include GPU-based algorithms for real-time 4D occlusion handling and transparency compositing; we thus enable a previously impossible level of quality and interactivity for exploring lit 4D objects. The 4D tetrahedrons are stored in GPU memory as vertex buffer objects, and the vertex shader is used to perform per-vertex 4D modelview transformations and 4D-to-3D projection. The geometry shader extension is utilized to slice the projected tetrahedrons and rasterize the slices into individual 2D layers of voxel fragments. Finally, the fragment shader performs per-voxel operations such as lighting and alpha blending with previously computed layers. We account for 4D voxel occlusion along the 4D-to-3D projection ray by supporting a multi-pass back-to-front fragment composition along the projection ray; to accomplish this, we exploit a new adaptation of the dual depth peeling technique to produce correct volume image data and to simultaneously render the resulting volume data using 3D transfer functions into the final 2D image. Previous CPU implementations of the rendering of 4D-embedded 3-manifolds could not perform either the 4D depth-buffered projection or manipulation of the volumerendered image in real-time; in particular, the dual depth peeling algorithm is a novel GPU-based solution to the real-time 4D depthbuffering problem. GL4D is implemented as an integrated OpenGL-style API library, so that the underlying shader operations are as transparent as possible to the user. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Making accurate computer graphics representations of surfaces and volumes (2-manifolds and 3-manifolds) embedded in four-dimensional space typically involves complex and time-consuming computations. In order to make simulated worlds that help develop human intuition about the fourth dimension, we need techniques that permit real-time, interactive manipulation of the most sophisticated depictions available. We propose the following new methods that bring us significantly closer to this goal: an approach to high-speed 4D illuminated surface rendering incorporating 4D shading and occlusion coding; a procedure for rapidly generating 2D screen images of tessellated 3-manifolds illuminated by 4D light. These methods are orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches, enabling the real-time manipulation of high-resolution 4D images on commercial graphics hardware.},

One of the most famous decompositions is the Heegaard splitting while the Hopf fibration is the most revered among the fibrations. In this article, we give an alternative proof of the fact that the 3-sphere S 3 can be decomposed into a union of two solid tori intersecting only at a common torus boundary using the Hopf fibration.},

abstract = {A synthetic approach to the construction of projective geometry, its methods and selected results are given in the proposed thesis. The main historical drawbacks of the original proof of Chasles's theorem for non-developable ruled surfaces and von Staudt's formalization of projective geometry are commented. The corresponding theoretical background is elaborated on visual demonstrations with the accent to interrelations of classical synthetic, axiomatic and analytic points of view. Synthetic methods of projective geometry and their mixture with analytic methods are described on examples including numerous alternative proofs and generalizations of some theorems. A method of four-dimensional visualization is introduced in details. Elementary constructions of images of points, lines, planes and 3-spaces are followed by models of polychora, their sections and shadows. Chasles's theorem is proven for non-developable ruled quadrics on synthetic visualizations, then generalized and proven within the pure projective framework for algebraic surfaces. The synthetic classification of regular quadrics is derived from descriptive geometry constructions of sections of four-dimensional cones and analytically verified in the projective extension of the real space. An integral part of the thesis is a supplementary online book with interactive constructions.},
