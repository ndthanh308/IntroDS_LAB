  "abstract": "In this paper, the structure of a dark matter halo can be well described by the mass model of M87 and the Einasto profile for the cold dark matter model, i.e., $ρ_{\\text{eina}} (r)=ρ_\\text{e} \\exp ( -2 α^{-1} ((r/r_\\text{e})^α-1 ) )$ (Wang et al. in Nature 585:39-42, 2020). Under these conditions, we construct a solution of a static spherically symmetric black hole in a dark matter halo. Then, using the Newman-janis algorithm, we extend this static solution to the case of rotation, and obtain a solution for the Kerr-like black hole. We prove that this solution of the Kerr-like black hole is indeed a solution to the Einstein field equations. Finally, taking M87 as an example, we study and analyze some physical properties of this Kerr-like black hole, and then compare them with the Kerr black hole. Particularly, from the perspective of the black hole shadow and the fact that the Kerr-like black hole and the Kerr black hole is distinguishable, we give the upper limit of the shape parameter of the Einasto density profile, that is approximately $α<0.22$, which may provide a new method to further improve and perfect the density profile of dark matter model. These research results for the black hole in a dark matter halo may indirectly provide an effective method for detecting the existence of dark matter.",
