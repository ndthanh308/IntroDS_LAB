  "abstract": "Digital quantum computers have the potential to study the dynamics of complex quantum systems. Nonequilibrium open quantum systems are, however, less straightforward to be implemented. Here we consider a collisional model representation of the nonequilibrium open dynamics for a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain, with a particular focus on its steady states. More specifically, we study the interplay between the accuracy of the result versus the depth of the circuit by comparing the results generated by the corresponding master equations. We study the simulation of a boundary-driven spin chain in regimes of weak and strong interactions, which would lead in large systems to diffusive and ballistic dynamics, considering also possible errors in the implementation of the protocol. Last, we analyze the effectiveness of digital simulation via the collisional model of current rectification when the XXZ spin chains are subject to non-uniform magnetic fields.",
