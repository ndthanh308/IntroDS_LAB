abstract = {Sephadex G-10 gel sieving chromatography, Jones-Dole viscosity B coefficients, and solution neutron and X-ray diffraction are used to show that small ions of high charge density (e.g., sulfate, phosphate, the carboxylate, sodium, and fluoride) are strongly hydrated (kosmotropes) whereas large monovalent ions of low charge density (e.g., ammonium, chloride, potassium, and the positively charged amino acid side chains) are weakly hydrated (chaotropes). The heats of solution of the crystalline alkali halides are then used to show that only oppositely charged ions of equal water affinity spontaneously form inner sphere ion pairs, and that this controls ion binding to proteins. The net charge on a protein is a major determinant of its solubility. Finally, the surface potential difference and surface tension at an air–salt solution interface are used to generate a simple model for how ions affect protein stability and solubility through indirect interactions at the protein–solution interface. A few comments about small neutral osmolytes are also included.}

We studied the isobaric heat capacity (Cp) temperature dependence and observed a maximum in Cp, occurring at Tm, that moves to lower temperature values with increasing salt concentration. Many characteristic changes were observed at scaled temperature T/Tm ∼ 0.96, namely a minimum in the density of the system, a reduction of the slope of the number of hydrogen bonds vs. temperature, and a crossover from Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher to Arrhenius dynamics. Finally, at low temperatures we observed that water dynamics become heterogeneous with an apparently common relationship between the fraction of immobile molecules and T/Tm for all studied systems.}",

Such models have become increasingly popular in molecular simulations given their ability to learn highly complex and multi-dimensional interactions within a local environment; however, many of them fundamentally lack a description of explicit long-range interactions. In order to provide a well-defined benchmark system with precisely known pairwise interactions, we chose as the reference model a flexible version of the Extended Simple Point Charge (SPC/E) water model. Our analysis shows that while local representations are sufficient for predictions of the condensed liquid phase, the short-range nature of machine-learning models falls short in representing cluster and vapor phase properties. These findings provide an improved understanding of the role of long-range interactions in machine learning models and the regimes where they are necessary.}",

    abstract = "{Translational diffusion coefficients are routinely estimated from molecular dynamics simulations. Linear fits to mean squared displacement (MSD) curves have become the de facto standard, from simple liquids to complex biomacromolecules. Nonlinearities in MSD curves at short times are handled with a wide variety of ad hoc practices, such as partial and piece-wise fitting of the data. Here, we present a rigorous framework to obtain reliable estimates of the self-diffusion coefficient and its statistical uncertainty. We also assess in a quantitative manner if the observed dynamics is, indeed, diffusive. By accounting for correlations between MSD values at different times, we reduce the statistical uncertainty of the estimator and, thereby, increase its efficiency. With a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, we check for possible anomalous diffusion. We provide an easy-to-use Python data analysis script for the estimation of self-diffusion coefficients. As an illustration, we apply the formalism to molecular dynamics simulation data of pure TIP4P-D water and a single ubiquitin protein. In another paper [S. von B\"ulow, J. T. Bullerjahn, and G. Hummer, J. Chem. Phys. 153, 021101 (2020)], we demonstrate its ability to recognize deviations from regular diffusion caused by systematic errors in a common trajectory “unwrapping” scheme that is implemented in popular simulation and visualization software.}",

abstract={We report on an extensive study of the viscosity of liquid water at near-ambient conditions, performed within the Green-Kubo theory of linear response and equilibrium ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), based on density-functional theory (DFT). In order to cope with the long simulation times necessary to achieve an acceptable statistical accuracy, our ab initio approach is enhanced with deep-neural-network potentials (NNP). This approach is first validated against AIMD results, obtained by using the Perdew--Burke--Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional and paying careful attention to crucial, yet often overlooked, aspects of the statistical data analysis. Then, we train a second NNP to a dataset generated from the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional. Once the error resulting from the imperfect prediction of the melting line is offset by referring the simulated temperature to the theoretical melting one, our SCAN predictions of the shear viscosity of water are in very good agreement with experiments.},

The methodology uses time samples efficiently across an ensemble of parallel replicas to yield accurate estimates, which is particularly useful for estimating the thermal conductivity of semi-conductors near their Debye temperatures where the characteristic decay times of the heat flux correlation functions are large. Employing and extending the error analysis of Zwanzig and Ailawadi [Phys. Rev. 182, 280 (1969)]10.1103/PhysRev.182.280 and Frenkel [in Proceedings of the International School of Physics “Enrico Fermi”, Course LXXV (North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1980)] to the integral of correlation, we are able to provide tight theoretical bounds for the error in the estimate of the transport coefficient. To demonstrate the performance of the method, four test cases of increasing computational cost and complexity are presented: the viscosity of Ar and water, and the thermal conductivity of Si and GaN. In addition to producing accurate estimates of the transport coefficients for these materials, this work demonstrates precise agreement of the computed variances in the estimates of the correlation and the transport coefficient with the extended theory based on the assumption that fluctuations follow a Gaussian process. The proposed algorithm in conjunction with the extended theory enables the calculation of transport coefficients with the Green-Kubo method accurately and efficiently.}",

abstract = {Hydrogen bond dynamics of water in NaBr solutions are studied by using ultrafast 2D IR vibrational echo spectroscopy and polarization-selective IR pump–probe experiments. The hydrogen bond structural dynamics are observed by measuring spectral diffusion of the OD stretching mode of dilute HOD in H2O in a series of high concentration aqueous NaBr solutions with 2D IR vibrational echo spectroscopy. The time evolution of the 2D IR spectra yields frequency–frequency correlation functions, which permit quantitative comparisons of the influence of NaBr concentration on the hydrogen bond dynamics. The results show that the global rearrangement of the hydrogen bond structure, which is represented by the slowest component of the spectral diffusion, slows, and its time constant increases from 1.7 to 4.8 ps as the NaBr concentration increases from pure water to ≈6 M NaBr. Orientational relaxation is analyzed with a wobbling-in-a-cone model describing restricted orientational diffusion that is followed by complete orientational randomization described as jump reorientation. The slowest component of the orientational relaxation increases from 2.6 ps (pure water) to 6.7 ps (≈6 M NaBr). Vibrational population relaxation of the OD stretch also slows significantly as the NaBr concentration increases.}}

In contrast to recent suggestions that the ion's hydration shell is rigid during a water's reorientation, we find a labile hydration sphere, consistent with previous assessments of chloride as a weak structure breaker. The nondiffusive reorientation mechanism found involves a hydrogen-bond partner switch with a large amplitude angular jump and the water's departure from the anion's shell. An analytic extended jump model accounts for the simulation results, as well as available NMR and ultrafast spectroscopic data, and resolves the discrepancy between them.}}

Besides quantitatively reproducing low-order many-body energy contributions, the new MB-nrg PEF is able to correctly predict the interaction energies of small chloride–water clusters calculated at the coupled cluster level of theory. Importantly, classical and quantum molecular dynamics simulations of a single chloride ion in water demonstrate that the new MB-nrg PEF predicts x-ray spectra in close agreement with the experimental results. Comparisons with an popular empirical model and a polarizable PEF emphasize the importance of an accurate representation of short-range many-body effect while demonstrating that pairwise additive representations of chloride–water and water–water interactions are inadequate for correctly representing the hydration structure of chloride in both gas-phase clusters and solution. We believe that the analyses presented in this study provide additional evidence for the accuracy and predictive ability of the MB-nrg PEFs, which can then enable more realistic simulations of ionic aqueous systems in different environments.}",

    abstract = "{ Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) has become established as an indispensable tool for investigating aqueous systems of all kinds, including those important in chemistry, surface science, biology, and the earth sciences. Nevertheless, many widely used approximations for the exchange-correlation (XC) functional describe the properties of pure water systems with an accuracy that is not fully satisfactory. The explicit inclusion of dispersion interactions generally improves the description, but there remain large disagreements between the predictions of different dispersion-inclusive methods. We present here a review of DFT work on water clusters, ice structures, and liquid water, with the aim of elucidating how the strengths and weaknesses of different XC approximations manifest themselves across this variety of water systems. Our review highlights the crucial role of dispersion in describing the delicate balance between compact and extended structures of many different water systems, including the liquid. By referring to a wide range of published work, we argue that the correct description of exchange-overlap interactions is also extremely important, so that the choice of semi-local or hybrid functional employed in dispersion-inclusive methods is crucial. The origins and consequences of beyond-2-body errors of approximate XC functionals are noted, and we also discuss the substantial differences between different representations of dispersion. We propose a simple numerical scoring system that rates the performance of different XC functionals in describing water systems, and we suggest possible future developments. }",

abstract  ="The specificity of aqueous halide solvation is fundamental to a wide range of bulk and interfacial phenomena spanning from biology to materials science. Halide polarizability is thought to drive the ion specificity{,} and if so{,} it is essential to have an accurate description of the electronic properties of halide ions in water. To this end{,} the solvation of the chloride anion{,} Cl− has been reinvestigated with state-of-the-art density functional theory. Specifically{,} the PBE-D3{,} PBE0-D3{,} and SCAN functionals have been employed to probe the impact of correlation and exchange approximations. Anticipating the findings{,} adding exact exchange improves the electronic structure{,} but simultaneously significantly reduces the Cl− polarizability{,} resulting in an over-structured Cl–O radial distribution function (RDF) and longer water H-bond lifetimes to Cl−. SCAN does not yield as much improvement in the energetics of Cl− relative to bulk water{,} but does result in a smaller reduction of the polarizability and thus a less structured Cl–O RDF{,} which agrees better with experiment. Special consideration is therefore warranted in assessing the impact of exchange on the energy{,} charge density{,} and the charge density response when designing and testing hybrid functionals for aqueous halide solvation."}

The measured Na–O distances of 2.384 ± 0.003 Å (XRD) and 2.37 ± 0.024 Å (EXAFS) are in excellent agreement. These measurements show a much shorter Na–O distance than generally reported in the experimental literature (Na–Oavg ∼ 2.44 Å) although the current measurements are in agreement with recent neutron diffraction measurements. The measured Na–O coordination number from XRD is 5.5 ± 0.3. The measured structure is compared with both classical and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Both of the DFT-based methods, revPBE and BLYP, predict a Na–O distance that is too long by about 0.05 Å with respect to the experimental data (EXAFS and XRD). The inclusion of dispersion interactions (–D3 and –D2) significantly worsens the agreement with experiment by further increasing the Na–O distance by 0.07 Å. In contrast, the use of a classical Na–O Lennard-Jones potential with SPC/E water accurately predicts the Na–O distance as 2.39 Å although the Na–O peak is over-structured with respect to experiment.}",

TIP4P/2005 is a rigid four site model which consists of three fixed point charges and one Lennard-Jones center. The parametrization has been based on a fit of the temperature of maximum density (indirectly estimated from the melting point of hexagonal ice), the stability of several ice polymorphs and other commonly used target quantities. The calculated properties include a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases, the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function, and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature range from 123to573K and pressures up to 40000bar. The model gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and thermodynamic conditions. For example, it gives excellent predictions for the densities at 1bar with a maximum density at 278K and an averaged difference with experiment of 7×10−4g∕cm3.}",

Such models have become increasingly popular in molecular simulations given their ability to learn highly complex and multi-dimensional interactions within a local environment; however, many of them fundamentally lack a description of explicit long-range interactions. In order to provide a well-defined benchmark system with precisely known pairwise interactions, we chose as the reference model a flexible version of the Extended Simple Point Charge (SPC/E) water model. Our analysis shows that while local representations are sufficient for predictions of the condensed liquid phase, the short-range nature of machine-learning models falls short in representing cluster and vapor phase properties. These findings provide an improved understanding of the role of long-range interactions in machine learning models and the regimes where they are necessary.}"

    abstract = "{Deep neural network (DNN) potentials have recently gained popularity in computer simulations of a wide range of molecular systems, from liquids to materials. In this study, we explore the possibility of combining the computational efficiency of the DeePMD framework and the demonstrated accuracy of the MB-pol data-driven, many-body potential to train a DNN potential for large-scale simulations of water across its phase diagram. We find that the DNN potential is able to reliably reproduce the MB-pol results for liquid water, but provides a less accurate description of the vapor–liquid equilibrium properties. This shortcoming is traced back to the inability of the DNN potential to correctly represent many-body interactions. An attempt to explicitly include information about many-body effects results in a new DNN potential that exhibits the opposite performance, being able to correctly reproduce the MB-pol vapor–liquid equilibrium properties, but losing accuracy in the description of the liquid properties. These results suggest that DeePMD-based DNN potentials are not able to correctly “learn” and, consequently, represent many-body interactions, which implies that DNN potentials may have limited ability to predict the properties for state points that are not explicitly included in the training process. The computational efficiency of the DeePMD framework can still be exploited to train DNN potentials on data-driven many-body potentials, which can thus enable large-scale, “chemically accurate” simulations of various molecular systems, with the caveat that the target state points must have been adequately sampled by the reference data-driven many-body potential in order to guarantee a faithful representation of the associated properties.}"}

We find that neural network potentials based on local representations of atomic environments are capable of describing some properties of liquid–vapor interfaces but typically fail for properties that depend on unbalanced long-ranged interactions that build up in the presence of broken translation symmetry. These same interactions cancel in the translationally invariant bulk, allowing local neural network potentials to describe bulk properties correctly. By incorporating explicit models of the slowly varying long-ranged interactions and training neural networks only on the short-ranged components, we can arrive at potentials that robustly recover interfacial properties. We find that local neural network models can sometimes approximate a local molecular field potential to correct for the truncated interactions, but this behavior is variable and hard to learn. Generally, we find that models with explicit electrostatics are easier to train and have higher accuracy. We demonstrate this perspective in a simple model of an asymmetric dipolar fluid, where the exact long-ranged interaction is known, and in an ab initio water model, where it is approximated.}",

abstract={Salt water is ubiquitous, playing crucial roles in geological and physiological processes. Despite centuries of investigations, whether or not water's structure is drastically changed by dissolved ions is still debated. Based on density functional theory, we employ machine learning based molecular dynamics to model sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium bromide solutions at different concentrations. The resulting reciprocal-space structure factors agree quantitatively with neutron diffraction data. Here we provide clear evidence that the ions in salt water do not distort the structure of water in the same way as neat water responds to elevated pressure. Rather, the computed structural changes are restricted to the ionic first solvation shells intruding into the hydrogen bond network, beyond which the oxygen radial-distribution function does not undergo major change relative to neat water. Our findings suggest that the widely cited pressure-like effect on the solvent in Hofmeister series ionic solutions should be carefully revisited.},

In addition, current measure-preserving schemes for the constant-volume, constant-temperature ensemble are also reviewed. A new geometric integrator for the NPT method is presented, is shown to preserve the correct phase-space volume element and is demonstrated to perform well in realistic examples. Finally, a multiple time-step version of the integrator is presented for treating systems with motion on several time scales.}}

In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress‐strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress‐strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.}",
