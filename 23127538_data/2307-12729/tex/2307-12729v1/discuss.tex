In this work, we have introduced a new concept of Persistent-Transient
Duality to model the multi-mechanism nature of human behavior in interaction
with objects. The duality is implemented into a parent-children network
that demonstrates its effectiveness and generalizability through extensive
evaluations in HOI-M forecasting. 

Given the ubiquity of persistent-transient relationship in human behavior
and the genericity of PTD design, the model can be readily extended
to other applications including \emph{pedestrian trajectory prediction}
(as demonstrated in Supp., Sec 9) and potentially \emph{social interaction
modeling}, and \emph{human-machine collaboration}. Future development
may include more fluid dynamics between the two processes and allowing
multiple transient instances.
