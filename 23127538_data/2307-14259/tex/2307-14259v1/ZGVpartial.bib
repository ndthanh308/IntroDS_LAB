	abstract = {The dispersion curves of (elastic) waveguides frequently exhibit crossings and osculations (also known as veering, repulsion, or avoided crossing). Osculations are regions in the dispersion diagram where curves approach each other arbitrarily closely without ever crossing before veering apart. In semi-analytical (undamped) waveguide models, dispersion curves are obtained as solutions to discretized parameterized Hermitian eigenvalue problems. In the mathematical literature, it is known that such eigencurves can exhibit crossing points only if the corresponding matrix flow (parameter-dependent matrix) is uniformly decomposable. We discuss the implications for the solution of the waveguide problem. In particular, we make use of a simple algorithm recently suggested in the literature for decomposing matrix flows. We also employ a method for mode tracing based on approximating the eigenvalue problem for individual modes by an ordinary differential equation that can be solved by standard procedures.},

These intriguing singularities have naturally motivated the discovery of their classical analogues. In this work, we present a general and direct procedure to reproduce the peculiar physics of graphene within a very simple acoustic metamaterial: a double lattice of soda cans resonating at two different frequencies. The first triangular sub-lattice generates a bandgap at low frequency, which induces a tight-binding coupling between the resonant defects of the second honeycomb one, hence allowing us to obtain a graphene-like band structure. We prove the relevance of this approach by showing that both numerical and experimental dispersion relations exhibit the requested Dirac cone. We also demonstrate the straightforward monitoring of the coupling strength within the crystal of resonant defects. This work shows that crystalline metamaterials are very promising candidates to investigate tantalizing solid-state physics phenomena with classical waves.},

While local interactions with the nearest neighbors are well appreciated, nonlocal beyond-nearest-neighbor interactions are often considered as a nuisance. Here, by introducing a versatile effectively two-dimensional metamaterial platform for airborne sound and elastic waves, we exploit nonlocal effects as a powerful design tool. Within a simplified discrete model, we analytically show that the lowest band can be engineered by Fourier synthesis, where the \$\$N\$\$-th order Fourier coefficient is determined by the \$\$N\$\$-th nearest-neighbor interaction strength. Roton-like dispersion relations are an example. The results of the discrete model agree well with a refined model and with numerical calculations. In addition, we engineer the passage of waves from a local metamaterial into a nonlocal metamaterial by carefully tailoring the transition region between the two.},

Using laser-based ultrasonic techniques, we experimentally investigate some fascinating properties of these ZGV modes: resonance and ringing effects, backward wave propagation, interference between backward and forward modes. Then, the conditions required for the existence of ZGV Lamb modes in isotropic plates are discussed. It is shown that these modes appear in a range of Poisson’s ratio about the value for which the cutoff frequency curves of modes belonging to the same family intercept, i.e., for a bulk wave velocity ratio equal to a rational number. An interpretation of this phenomenon in terms of a strong repulsion between a pair of modes having a different parity in the vicinity of the cutoff frequencies is given. Experiments performed with materials of various Poisson’s ratio demonstrate that the resonance spectrum of an unloaded elastic plate, locally excited by a laser pulse, is dominated by the ZGV Lamb modes.},

A numerical model is inversely optimized in order to match dispersion curves measured by laser vibrometry. This kind of material characterization has gained interest in recent research. Improvements in accuracy and efficiency of the optimization process are therefore important steps toward an industrial application of this technique to nondestructive testing and online monitoring. For this purpose, the use of a fast converging numerical model based on spectral collocation has been found to be well suited. Furthermore, we improved the signal-to-noise ratio by utilizing long-time broadband excitation signals for multimodal excitation of Lamb waves. The wavenumber spectrum up to 2.5 MHz is acquired by measurements with a laser-scanning vibrometer. In order to exploit the information contained in high-order modes, we present an algorithm to match the measured data to the calculated modes during the optimization process, leading to higher accuracy of the estimated model parameters.

Such characteristics are determined from a dispersion relation in the form of an eigenvalue problem established from the FE formulation. In particular, vital characteristics such as the modal density, the group velocity and the waveform are evaluated. A description of the evaluation of a dispersion relation for a channel beam, from data given by the FE formulation, is presented. Subsequently, the method for determining the modal density and group velocity from FE input data is shown in detail for the beam structure. To show the versatility of the method a second example considers a statistical energy analysis (SEA), made to establish the degree to which vibrations in a wind tunnel are transmitted to a thin-walled plate mounted into its wall. The critical input datum to the SEA model is the wind tunnel's modal density, which is calculated by the method presented.},

	abstract = {Nanoporosity in silicon leads to completely new functionalities of this mainstream semiconductor. A difficult to assess mechanics has however significantly limited its application in fields ranging from nanofluidics and biosensorics to drug delivery, energy storage and photonics. Here, we present a study on laser-excited elastic guided waves detected contactless and non-destructively in dry and liquid-infused single-crystalline porous silicon. These experiments reveal that the self-organised formation of 100 billions of parallel nanopores per square centimetre cross section results in a nearly isotropic elasticity perpendicular to the pore axes and an 80\% effective stiffness reduction, altogether leading to significant deviations from the cubic anisotropy observed in bulk silicon. Our thorough assessment of the wafer-scale mechanics of nanoporous silicon provides the base for predictive applications in robust on-chip devices and evidences that recent breakthroughs in laser ultrasonics open up entirely new frontiers for in-situ, non-destructive mechanical characterisation of dry and liquid-functionalised porous materials.},

	abstract = {A non-invasive ultrasonic flow meter is studied for which the pipe remains unperforated and without obstructions in its interior. Elastic waves that are excited inside the pipe wall interact with the adjacent fluid to form quasi-guided waves. These can be either of leaky or trapped kind. The radiation of the leaky waves is exploited to insonify the pipe's interior. The quasi-guided waves are studied in-depth with particular emphasis on their radiation behavior. Highly reliable and efficient computational methods are developed for this purpose. The ultrasonic transit time in the flow meter is modeled systematically based on the aforementioned waves. Thereby, the effects of fluid flow and temperature are included explicitly in an analytical manner. Compared to conventional ultrasonic flow meters, we find that devices based on quasi-guided waves exhibit a strongly reduced cross-sensitivity to temperature, which is also confirmed experimentally. The developed analytical and numerical techniques enable a systematic optimization of such devices with regard to their temperature-dependent behavior, geometrical uncertainties, material aging, as well as scaling and deposition of other layers.},

The sign of this coefficient and hence of the in-plane group velocity near cutoffs decides the existence or non-existence of the backward Lamb waves without a necessity to calculate the dispersion branches. A link between the near-cutoff dispersion of Lamb waves and the curvature of bulk-wave slowness curves in a sagittal plane is analyzed. It is established that a locally concave slowness curve of a bulk mode entails the backward Lamb waves at the onset of branches emerging from this bulk mode resonances of high enough order. A simple sufficient condition for no backward Lamb waves near the resonances associated with a convex slowness curve is also noted. Two special cases are discussed: the first involves the coupled resonances of degenerate bulk waves, and the second concerns quasi-degenerate resonances which give rise to pairs of dispersion branches with a quasilinear positive and negative onset. Occasions of the backward Lamb waves in isotropic plate materials are tabulated.},

	abstract = {To date, the phenomenon of zero group velocity (ZGV) Lamb wave in a stress-free elastic plate has been well studied and used in non-destructive material characterization, electroacoustic devices and some other applications. This phenomenon is associated with the backward mode appearing in the range limited by the ZGV and cutoff frequencies. The modal frequency response of the structure, primarily the spectrum of the corresponding guided wave (GW) excited in the plate by a force source, is featured by a sharp peak at the ZGV frequency, allowing its experimental detection. Other peaks appearing at the cutoff frequencies indicate thickness resonances. In a layered half-space of infinite thickness, the backward-mode bend of the dispersion curve turns into a double bend that gives rise to three GWs associated with the same branch (one backward and two forward modes). Moreover, several adjacent branches with double bends, and, thus, several peaks, can appear in a narrow range as the number of layers increases, indicating multiple ZGV resonances. Such dispersion curves with double ZGV points were also found in waveguides of finite thickness with anisotropic or contrast material properties; however, their resonance manifestation is poorly studied. In this article, we consider and discuss several kinds of multi-peak ZGV responses using examples of layered samples of various materials. Along with the expected increase in the number of peaks in multilayer structures with contrast layers, it was noted that some ZGV points may or may not appear in peaks, depending on the type of load.},

Elastic guided waves, similar to Lamb modes in a plate, can propagate in the axial direction or around the circumference. They are sensitive to geometrical and mechanical parameters of the cylindrical shell. The objective of this paper is to show that zero group velocity (ZGV) Lamb modes can be used to bring out anisotropy and to measure elastic constants of the material. This study provides experimental and numerical investigations on a Zirconium alloy tube extensively used by the nuclear industry in reactor core components. A non-contact method, based on laser ultrasound techniques and ZGV Lamb modes, demonstrates that the difference observed between axial and circumferential guided waves cannot be explained by an isotropic model. Then, a transverse isotropic model is used for the Zircaloy tube. Four of the five elastic constants are directly extracted from ZGV resonance frequencies. The last one is deduced from the measured dispersion spectra. With this complete set of constants, a good agreement is obtained between theoretical and experimental dispersion curves for both axially and circumferentially propagating guided waves.},

This method relies on the measurements of multimode guided waves, which are launched and detected in arbitrary directions along the plate using a multi-element linear transducer array driven by a programmable electronic device. A model-based inverse problem solution is proposed to optimally recover the properties of interest. The main contribution consists in defining an objective function built from the dispersion equation, which allows accounting for higher-order modes without the need to pair each experimental data point to a specific guided mode. This avoids the numerical calculation of the dispersion curves and errors in the mode identification. Compared to standard root-finding algorithms, the computational gain of the procedure is estimated to be on the order of 200. The objective function is optimized using genetic algorithms, which allow identifying from a single out-of-symmetry axis measurement the full set of anisotropic elastic coefficients and either the plate thickness or the propagation direction. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated using data measured on materials with different symmetry classes. Excellent agreement is found between the reported estimates and reference values from the literature.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate the in situ measurement of zero-group-velocity Lamb waves and thickness-resonances in steel sheet samples using laser-based ultrasound, while changing the sample temperature from ambient to 1000 ∘C. The ratio of resonance frequencies yields the temperature dependent Poisson’s ratio of its material without requiring knowledge on the sheets’ thickness. Changes in the temperature derivative of the determined Poisson’s ratio reflect changes in the microstructural constituents. We show that additional resonances present in the response spectrum can be used to cross-check the evaluation. With additional knowledge on the thickness, longitudinal and transverse sound velocities are determined as well. We find good qualitative agreement between the temperature dependence of the measured quantities and reference data obtained from dilatometry and thermodynamic material simulations. The determination of the Poisson’s ratio and transverse sound velocity complements previous investigations limited to the longitudinal sound velocity. This is particularly evident above the Curie temperature during the ferrite to austenite transformation and could be beneficial to disentangle transformations with more than two microstructural constituents involved. Finally, the limitations posed by elastic anisotropy introduced by rolling texture, and experimental uncertainties due to temperature inhomgeneities are discussed. We conclude that the laser-ultrasonic measurement of plate resonances provides a robust, contact-free, non-destructive, and in situ determination of Poisson’s ratio.},

The formulation is based on the Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method. The through-thickness direction of the plate is discretized in the finite element sense, while the direction of propagation is described analytically. This leads to a standard eigenvalue problem for the calculation of wave numbers. The proposed method is not limited to homogeneous plates. Multi-layered composites as well as structures with continuously varying material parameters in the direction of thickness can be modeled without essential changes in the formulation. Higher-order elements have been employed for the finite element discretization, leading to excellent convergence for complex structures. It is shown by numerical examples that this method provides highly accurate results with a small number of nodes while avoiding numerical problems and instabilities.},

As the elastodynamic energy at these points remains confined close to the source, they are of practical interest for nondestructive testing and quantitative characterization of structures. These applications rely on the correct prediction of the ZGV points. In this contribution, we first model the ZGV resonances in anisotropic plates based on the appearance of an additional modal solution. The resulting governing equation is interpreted as a two-parameter eigenvalue problem. Subsequently, we present three complementary numerical procedures capable of computing ZGV points in arbitrary nondissipative elastic waveguides in the conventional sense that their axial power flux vanishes. The first method is globally convergent and guarantees to find all ZGV points but can only be used for small problems. The second procedure is a very fast, generally-applicable, Newton-type iteration that is locally convergent and requires initial guesses. The third method combines both kinds of approaches and yields a procedure that is applicable to large problems, does not require initial guesses and is likely to find all ZGV points. The algorithms are implemented in GEW ZGV computation (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.7537442).},

	abstract = {Shifting to rail-bound freight and passenger traffic is key in Europe's strategy towards transport decarbonisation. However, increasing railway traffic can increase environmental noise pollution. Rolling noise is often the dominant noise source. It originates from the interaction of the rough running surfaces of wheel and rail. Predicting rolling noise and performing acoustic optimisation of existing and new tracks requires validated, flexible, and physics-based prediction tools. This is especially relevant for the different designs of ballastless tracks, which are increasingly used for high-speed lines. Therefore, this thesis aims to develop and implement a modelling approach for rolling noise in the time and frequency domain to increase understanding of sound radiation, investigate noise mitigation measures, and allow research of the perception of transients in rolling noise.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}To achieve this, models for vibration in wheels and several types of ballasted and slab tracks have been implemented using the Waveguide Finite Element method. This method allows an efficient prediction of the track vibration up to high frequencies. Next, models for the sound radiation from wheel and track were implemented using adaptions of the Boundary Element method (BEM), such as the Fourier series BEM and the wavenumber domain BEM.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}The computational efficiency was addressed in multiple ways. Finally, an approach to simulate the sound produced at a stationary track-side receiver has been developed and implemented based on moving Green's functions. The simulations were largely implemented in in-house Python code. The ballasted and slab track dynamic models have been tuned and compared with measurements on full-scale tracks.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}The developed models have been used to analyse the vibrations in track and wheel and the acoustic radiation from these vibrations. This allowed the investigation of noise mitigation measures. Further, the necessary complexity of the dynamic track model for predicting rolling noise in time domain was investigated. Two parameter studies were carried out with a focus on track design with lower noise emission. Slab tracks with booted sleepers showed a potential for noise reduction without increasing loads on the track structure. A continuous rail support lowered the radiated sound power at high frequencies. The contributions of different wheel modes to the radiated sound were investigated considering the directivity of each mode, and dominant modes were identified. The established models produce time signals usable for auralisation, which, among others, has the potential to research human perception of transients in rolling noise.},

In this paper, the optical generation and detection of these zero-group velocity (ZGV) Lamb modes in an anisotropic plate is investigated. With a circular laser source, multiple local resonances were observed on a silicon wafer. Experiments performed with a line source demonstrated that the frequency and the amplitude of these resonances depend on the line orientation.

The existence ranges of backward Lamb modes increase with the mode order contrary to the case of isotropic plates. The quasi-collinear light scattering by Lamb waves is considered. Owing to the structure of Lamb wave field, a simultaneous light diffraction at two different optical frequencies can take place while Lamb waves are excited only at the single frequency. It is demonstrated with the Z-cut (110)-propagating plate that a small change in the acoustic frequency can result in a significant shift in the frequency of the scattered light.},

	abstract = {A novel method has been developed for the determination of mechanical and elastic properties of thin films such as film thickness, density, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. In this technique short laser pulses (ns-ps) are used to excite a broad-band surface acoustic wave pulse, and a cw laser (Michelson interferometer, probe beam deflection) or piezoelectric foil detector is employed for time-resolved detection of the resulting surface displacements. In a hydrogen-terminated ideal silicon crystal the surface wave pulse shows no dispersion effect. However, a thin native oxide layer, normally present on the surface, leads to a linear decrease of the phase velocity with frequency. Partially this dispersion effect may be due to damage caused by lapping. A quantitative analysis of the shape of the surface wave pulse as a function of energy of the exciting laser pulse yields the threshold fluences for the melting and ablation of silicon. Doping of silicon leads to nonlinear dispersion, which was used to characterize the doping profile and elastic properties of the doped region. For amorphous hydrogenated silicon films, used in photovoltaics, the density and elastic constants were measured. Different carbon films with widely varying mechanical and elastic properties were studied. For thin fullerite films (C60, C70) the density and elastic constants were determined for the first time, showing that this is the softest form of carbon. The quality of amorphous diamondlike and polycrystalline diamond films was investigated by comparing the density and elastic constants with those of single-crystal diamond. Due to its high information content the method allows a reliable characterization of these films with a thickness in the micrometer range.},

By using a scanned source and viewing a large number of signals measured at adjacent source/receiver configurations, one obtains a so‐called scan image which represents the detailed spatial and temporal characteristics of the elastic wave field in a specimen. The measurement system uses either a focused, pulsed laser beam operating as a dipole source or a small aperture, piezoceramic shear transducer serving as a monopolar source. Detection of the signals is with a sensitive piezoceramic sensor that responds to the lateral or shear motions of the specimen surface. Scan images were obtained in a Silicon wafer whose thickness was 625 μm and in one‐ or two‐ply, unidirectional, graphite/epoxy laminates whose thicknesses were approximately 145 and 275 μm, respectively. The experimental data are analyzed using a simple plane‐wave, plane‐stress model that describes the propagation of quasilongitudinal and quasitransverse membrane waves in the plane of the plate. Good agreement is obtained between the experimental and theoretical group velocity curves of the membrane waves in the laminates. It is shown that the measured group velocity data of different wave modes can be inverted to recover the elastic constants of a material with excellent reliability and accuracy. The measurement system was also used to map out the group velocities in branches comprising the cuspidal region of the quasi‐transverse group velocity curve.},

	abstract = {Scanning acoustic microscopy techniques operating at frequencies in the gigahertz range are suitable for the elastic characterization and interior imaging of solid media with micrometer-scale spatial resolution. Acoustic wave propagation at these frequencies is strongly limited by energy losses, particularly from attenuation in the coupling media used to transmit ultrasound to a specimen, leading to a decrease in the depth in a specimen that can be interrogated. In this work, a laser-based acoustic microscopy technique is presented that uses a pulsed laser source for the generation of broadband acoustic waves and an optical interferometer for detection. The use of a 900-ps microchip pulsed laser facilitates the generation of acoustic waves with frequencies extending up to 1 GHz which allows for the resolution of micrometer-scale features in a specimen. Furthermore, the combination of optical generation and detection approaches eliminates the use of an ultrasonic coupling medium, and allows for elastic characterization and interior imaging at penetration depths on the order of several hundred micrometers. Experimental results illustrating the use of the laser-based acoustic microscopy technique for imaging micrometer-scale subsurface geometrical features in a 70-μm-thick single-crystal silicon wafer with a (100) orientation are presented.},

The technique is remote, non-destructive and works on-line, making it an attractive inspection tool for use in semiconductor foundries. Vibration modes were generated by a pulse from a frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and detected by a commercial heterodyne Michelson interferometer. Because of their importance as component substrates in the electronic and MEMS industries, both the ⟨100⟩ and ⟨111⟩ silicon wafers were investigated. It was found that the resonance frequencies of the first pure torsional and of the first hybrid (torsional and flexural) modes varied continuously and symmetrically with respect to a 90° rotation of the wafer around the centre, while the resonance frequencies of the first and second pure flexural modes remained constant. On the basis of this experimental observation, we could correlate the resonance frequencies of the two former and two latter modes with the in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical parameters E and σ, respectively. A novel inverse method for circular anisotropic plates was then derived to extract the in-plane and out-of-plane parameters from the resonance frequency measurements. The results obtained by this approach were in good agreement with the standard values calculated by the theory of elasticity.},

High-frequency guided waves allow for the monitoring of wafers and detection and characterization of surface defects. The material anisotropy of the monocrystalline silicon leads to variations of the guided wave characteristics, depending on the guided wave mode and propagation direction relative to the crystal orientation. Selective excitation of the first antisymmetric A0 wave mode at 5 MHz center frequency was achieved experimentally using a custom-made wedge transducer. Strong wave pulses with limited beam skewing and widening were measured using noncontact laser interferometer measurements. This allowed the accurate characterization of the Lamb wave propagation and scattering at small artificial surface defects with a size of less than 100 µm. The surface extent of the defects of varying size was characterized using an optical microscope. The scattered guided wave field was evaluated, and characteristic parameters were extracted and correlated with the defect size, allowing in principle detection of small defects. Further investigations are required to explain the systematic asymmetry of the guided wave field in the vicinity of the indents.},

	abstract = {This article reports a new mechanism involving a non-perforated resonant elastic metamaterial to achieve the complete conversion of Lamb waves (A0 and S0) into the fundamental shear horizontal (SH0) wave. The proposed metamaterial ultrasound mode convertor is studied via the observation of the special resonant shear motion of its unit cells, initiating with a conventional additive stub design. Thereafter, such a stubbed structure is further modified to fully couple the Lamb modes with the shear horizontal stub motion. By investigating the band structure of the metamaterial unit cell through modal analysis and tuning the shear resonant motions, a complete SH0 mode generation band within the simultaneous Lamb modes bandgap can be established in a wide frequency range. Such a special bandgap situation enables the complete mode conversion from Lamb waves into shear horizontal waves. The transformation capability of the proposed ultrasound mode convertor is further substantiated via the harmonic analysis of metamaterial chain model, showcasing the frequency spectrum of the transmitted wave modes. The optimal configuration is determined by conducting a parametric study to identify the most effective mode conversion performance. Finally, a coupled-field transient finite element simulation is carried out to acquire the dynamic response of the structure. The frequency-wavenumber analysis of the transmitted wave field illuminates the successful realization of the mode conversion behavior. Experimental demonstrations are presented to validate the numerical predictions. The proposed complete mode conversion capability may possess great potential for wave control and manipulation.},

were determined from the incident angle at which a specific mode of Lamb waves were
generated However there are numerous incident angles with the transducer used in this
experiment, received signal contains various waves of different frequencies The V(z)
curve for a specific frequency was obtained from V(f, z) which is the FFT (fast Fourier

a method similar to that used in acoustic microscopy Finally, the phase velocity can
be determined as a function of the propagation direction by rotating the silicon wafers
The angular dependences of the wavenumber and Lamb wave phase velocity were obtained,
and they show good agreement with the crystalline orientation of the silicon wafers

	abstract = {This paper presents two newly developed models of capacitive silicon bulk acoustic resonators (SiBARs) characterized by a rectangular-bar geometry. The first model is derived from an approximate analytical solution of the linear elastodynamic equations for a parallelepiped made of an orthotropic material. This solution, which is recognized to represent a Lamb wave propagating across the width of the resonator, yields the frequencies and shapes of the resonance modes that typically govern the operation of SiBARs. The second model is numerical and is based on a finite-element multiphysics simulation of both acoustic wave propagation in the resonator and electromechanical transduction in the capacitive gaps of the device. It is especially useful in the computation of the SiBAR performance parameters, which cannot be obtained from the analytical model, e.g., the relationship between the transduction area and the insertion loss. Comparisons with the measurements taken on a set of silicon resonators fabricated using electron-beam lithography show that both models can predict the resonance frequencies of SiBARs with a relative error, which, in most cases, is significantly smaller than 1\%.},

The phase slowness and beam skewing of the two fundamental Lamb wave modes A0 and S0 were investigated. Experimental measurements using contact wedge transducer excitation and laser measurement were conducted. Good agreement was found between the theoretically calculated angular dependency of the phase slowness and measurements for different propagation directions relative to the crystal orientation. Significant wave skew and beam widening was observed experimentally due to the anisotropy, especially for the S0 mode. Explicit finite element simulations were conducted to visualize and quantify the guided wave beam skew. Good agreement was found for the A0 mode, but a systematic discrepancy was observed for the S0 mode.

The RUV method is based on excitation of the longitudinal ultrasonic vibrations in full-size wafers. Using an external piezoelectric transducer combined with a high sensitivity ultrasonic probe and computer controlled data acquisition system, real-time frequency response analysis can be accomplished. On a set of identical crystalline Si wafers with artificially introduced periphery cracks, it was demonstrated that the crack results in a frequency shift in a selected RUV peak to a lower frequency and increases the resonance peak bandwidth. Both characteristics were found to increase with the length of the crack. The frequency shift and bandwidth increase serve as reliable indicators of the crack appearance in silicon wafers and are suitable for mechanical quality control and fast wafer inspection.},

Previous researchers presented the crack detection on the silicon wafers with the air-coupled ultrasonic method successfully. However, the high impedance mismatching will be the problem in the industrial field. In this paper, in order to detect the crack, we propose a laser generated Lamb wave method which is not only noncontact, but also reliable for the measurement. The laser-ultrasonic generator and the laser-interferometer are used as a transmitter and a receiver, respectively. We firstly verified the identification of S0 and A0 lamb wave modes and then conducted the crack detection under the thermoelastic regime. The experimental results showed that S0 and A0 modes of lamb wave were clearly generated and detected, and in the case of the crack detection, the estimated crack size by 6 dB drop method was almost equal to the actual crack size. So, the proposed method is expected to make it possible to detect the crack in the silicon wafer in the industrial fields.},

Experimental results reveal that the resonant frequencies can be fairly obtained by means of probing the variation of the effective impedance of the exciter with and without the thin plate. The influence of the extra mass from the central exciter is confirmed to be insignificant in measuring the resonant frequencies of the present system. In the theoretical aspect, the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation is exploited to derive the response function as a function of the driving wave number for reconstructing experimental Chladni patterns. The resonant wave numbers are theoretically identified with the maximum coupling efficiency as well as the maximum entropy principle. Substituting the theoretical resonant wave numbers into the derived response function, all experimental Chladni patterns can be excellently reconstructed. More importantly, the dispersion relationship for the flexural wave of the vibrating plate can be determined with the experimental resonant frequencies and the theoretical resonant wave numbers. The determined dispersion relationship is confirmed to agree very well with the formula of the Kirchhoff–Love plate theory.},

Particular attention is given to reviewing the techniques that have probed the intricacy of acoustic wave propagation in crystals, including phonon imaging, laser- and capillary-fracture-generated ultrasound, transmission acoustic microscopy and surface Brillouin scattering, and a selection of results obtained with these techniques is presented. Some of these studies pertain to bulk waves and others to surface acoustic waves. The interpretation of far-field observations is carried out within the ray approximation, and elastodynamic Green’s functions are invoked in the interpretation of near-field results.

Numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate that for the fundamental A0 and S0 modes, this phenomenon, analog to the phonon focusing effect, can be very strong in materials such as composite fiber-reinforced polymers. This effect due to the plate anisotropy must be correctly taken into account, for example, in order to develop systems for in situ structural health monitoring.

	abstract = {Elastic wave anisotropy is deemed to be an intrinsic material property which is fully determined by the matrix of elastic moduli. One of the results of this study is the finding that this is not true for ultrasonic waves in plates whose anisotropy is shown to be a function of frequency.
The “dispersion of anisotropy” occurs for plate waves in all anisotropic materials including fibre-reinforced composites. The physical reason for the dispersion of velocity anisotropy is concerned with frequency dependent wave structure which activates different elasticity for
various propagation directions. To probe anisotropy of a certain stiffness component (e.g. Young's modulus), the plate wave fields should be kept similar by variation in operation frequency. The phase velocity anisotropy and its frequency dependence provide frequency variation of the beam
steering angle for plate waves (dispersion of beam steering). This effect is important to be accounted for in various applications since the plate waves are widely used for non-destructive evaluation of composite materials. A strong frequency-dependent focusing of ultrasonic energy (dispersion
of phonon focusing) occurs for a
0-waves in unidirectional carbon fibre reinforced composite. The phonon focusing prevents omni-directional wave propagation that might pose a problem in the plate wave applications for structural health monitoring. The results presented indicate
that the effect of plate wave anisotropy and its implications can be enhanced or diminished by matching the operation frequency.},

An approach based on a residue integration technique for two dimensional wavenumber integrals for the computation of displacements outside an excitation source is presented in this paper. In the far-field zone of the excitation source, the method of stationary phase is used, which gives an asymptotic expansion of the displacement vector as a sum of cylindrical waves. Near caustic directions, a far-field solution is computed in terms of Airy functions. The results obtained applying residue integration technique and asymptotic expansion are found to be coinciding with the results of the computation by using the adaptive quadratures. Moreover, these approaches agree well with experimental data. Then, the advantages and disadvantages of the various methods applied for modeling of Lamb wave propagation are discussed in this paper.

	abstract = {Elastic guided waves (GW) are used in various non-destructive testing (NDT) methods to inspect plate-like structures, generated by finite-sized transducers. Thanks to GW long range propagation, using a few transducers at permanent positions can provide a full coverage of the plate. Transducer diffraction effects take place, leading to complex radiated fields. Optimizing transducers positioning makes it necessary to accurately predict the GW field radiated by a transducer. Fraunhofer-like approximations applied to GW in isotropic homogeneous plates lead to fast and accurate field computation but can fail when applied to multi-layered anisotropic composite plates, as shown by some examples given. Here, a model is proposed for composite plates, based on the computation of the approximate Green's tensor describing modal propagation from a source point, with account of caustics typically seen when strong anisotropy is concerned. Modal solutions are otherwise obtained by the Semi-Analytic Finite Element method. Transducer diffraction effects are accounted for by means of an angular integration over the transducer surface as seen from the calculation point, that is, over energy paths involved, which are mode-dependent. The model is validated by comparing its predictions with those computed by means of a full convolution integration of the Green's tensor with the source over transducer surface. Examples given concern disk and rectangular shaped transducers commonly used in NDT.},

Moreover, traveling four-wave mixing experiments are implemented, providing a platform on which to realize novel nonlinear phenomena in the system.

	abstract = {A great variety of caustics are observed in the phonon images of crystals. These structures are the result of phonon focusing, i.e., the crowding together in direction of phonon ray vectors that is brought about by elastic anisotropy. Many of the elementary catastrophes can be identified in these caustics. It is argued in this paper that a more penetrating understanding of phonon caustics is arrived at if the ratios of the elastic constants are regarded as control parameters supplementing the two that arise in the specification of the direction of the phonon flux. In this way one can explain the presence in phonon images of slightly unfolded sections of higher-order catastrophes such as the butterfly and hyperbolic umbilic. The main thrust of this paper is to draw attention to a variety of extraordinary caustics occasioned by the particular form of the elastic wave equation for crystals, and by the constraints of symmetry and degeneracy between the different phonon branches. Examples are given of the global development of caustics, and the phenomenon of external conical refraction and its unfolding under a symmetry-breaking perturbation is treated. The close link between degeneracy and the existence of caustics is explored. Conical, tangential, line, surface, and triple degeneracies are considered, and the transformations brought about in the caustics by perturbations that change the form of the degeneracy, are described. These findings suggest a route by which phonon imaging could be used in the study of phase transitions and for measuring certain hard-to-obtain elastic constants. It is anticipated that these results should also assist in the classification of the phonon-focusing patterns of lower-symmetry crystals.},

	abstract = {The joint effect of viscosity and heat conductivity on the propagation of plane bulk acoustic waves is studied in the low-loss approximation. Weak dissipation has significant impact on wave properties in the neighborhood of those acoustic axes (directions of phase-speed degeneracy occurring in the absence of dissipation) which are not parallel to symmetry axes and which therefore split into pairs of degenerate complex wave vectors not lying in symmetry planes. The bifurcation nature of the wave branches in the neighboring domain and the drastically changing polarization features are analyzed. Wave solutions containing linear spatial dependence of the pre-exponential amplitude admitted along pairwise directions of wave-vector degeneracy are studied.},

	abstract = {The shape of the acoustic ray surface of cubic crystals is investigated with the object of providing a framework within which the results of phonon imaging and other ballistic phonon experiments can be interpreted. This surface is shown to display considerable variability in shape, particularly with regard to the way in which it is folded. The correspondence between these folds and contours of zero Gaussian curvature on the slowness surface is explored, and the bearing this has on the presence of caustics in the anistropic flux of phonons emanating from a localized hear source is discussed. Several of the elementary catastrophes as well as some remarkable types of structural instability are shown to occur in these caustics. Conditions on the elastic constants are established for the existence of various systems of folds in the ray surface.},

	abstract = {It is shown that under very general conditions there is a rigorous identity between the group velocity and the velocity of energy transport in nonhomogeneous media with or without anomalous dispersion. The medium is assumed nondissipative and the parameters such as density, rigidity, dielectric constant, etc., vary from point to point but are independent of the Cartesian coordinate lying in the direction of the mode propagation. This covers propagation in any type of wave guide, surface waves, propagation in stratified media, etc. The identity is established for fluids, for isotropic and anisotropic solids with or without prestress, and for electromagnetic waves. Anomalous dispersion is assumed to result from hidden coordinates such as electron oscillators. A new variational formulation of field theory is introduced. An interesting application is to wave propagation in an electron gas and it is shown that such wave propagation obeys the relativistic Schrödinger equation for a mass particle.},
