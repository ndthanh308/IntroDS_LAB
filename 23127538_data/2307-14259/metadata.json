  "abstract": "Elastic waves in anisotropic media can exhibit a power flux that is not collinear with the wave vector. This has notable consequences for waves guided in a plate. Through laser-ultrasonic experiments, we evidence remarkable phenomena due to slow waves in a single crystal silicon wafer. Waves exhibiting power flux orthogonal to their wave vector are identified. A pulsed line source that excites these waves reveals a wave packet radiated parallel to the line. Furthermore, there exist precisely eight plane waves with zero power flux. These so-called zero-group-velocity modes are oriented along the crystal's principal axes. Time acts as a filter in the wave vector domain that selects these modes. Thus, a point source leads to beating resonance patterns with moving nodal curves on the surface of the infinite plate. We observe this pattern as it emerges naturally after a pulsed excitation.",
