\section{Echo chamber detection}
In this section are included supplementary materials related to Section \ref{sec:EC_CS}.
\\
The plots in this section show for \textit{Gun Control} (Figure \ref{fig:EC_GC}), \textit{Minorities discrimination} (Figure \ref{fig:EC_minority}) and \textit{Politics} (Figure \ref{fig:EC_politics}) the presence of polarized communities in each of the temporal snapshot.
Communities are represented through a scatterplot, where the radius of the points corresponds to the size of the community.
The vertical line represents the boundary set for Purity ($Purity>=0.7$), while the horizontal is the inverse of \textit{Conductance} ($1-Conductance >= 0.5$). Ideally, most polarized echo chambers are placed in the upper right corner.

\section{Topic modeling on polarized systems}
This section shows the resulting figures from the BERTopic application for the echo chambers and communities discussed in Section \ref{sec:topicModelingCS} of the paper.
\subsection{Gun control}
The bar plots included in Figure \ref{fig:bertopicGuncontrol} show the evolution and distribution of the five most prominent topics identified by BERTopic within the community focusing on the war in Syria. Each bar plot refers to a specific temporal span outlined in the caption.

\subsection{Minorities discrimination}
The plot represents the unfolding of the discussions about Gamergate (Figure \ref{fig:bertopicMinorityGG}) and antifascism (Figure \ref{fig:MinorityBerkeley}) over the two years and a half considered by the case study, as described in Section \ref{sec:topicModelingCS} of the paper.
