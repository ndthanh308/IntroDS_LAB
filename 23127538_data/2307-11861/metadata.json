  "abstract": "Pairing energies for the addition of two neutrons on even-even nuclei with $ N=Z $ are studied. The $ Z $ dependence is attributed to the number and type of orbitals that are occupied in the valence shell-model space. Properties in the region from $ Z=60-100 $ depend on the location of the $ 0g_{9/2} $ orbital.",
