  "abstract": "We prove that if the $m$-th homotopy group for $m \\geq 2$ of a closed manifold has non-trivial invariants or coinvariants under the action of the fundamental group, then there exist infinitely many geometrically distinct closed geodesics for a $C^4$-generic Riemannian metric. If moreover there are infinitely many conjugacy classes in the fundamental group, then the same holds for every Riemannian metric.",
