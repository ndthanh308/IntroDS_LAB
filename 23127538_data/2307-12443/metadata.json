  "abstract": "This article describes a novel approach to chance-constrained programming based on the sample average approximation (SAA) method. Recent work focuses on heuristic approximations to the SAA problem and we introduce a novel approach which improves on some existing methods. Our Active Set method allows one to solve SAAs of chance-constrained programs with very large numbers of scenarios quickly. We demonstrate that increasing the number of scenarios is more important than improving accuracy with small numbers of scenarios.\n  We use an example of the portfolio selection problem to demonstrate the relative performance of previous and new methods. Extending the Active Set method to an integer-programming model further highlights its applicability and further improves over previous approaches.",
