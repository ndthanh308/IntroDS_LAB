  "abstract": "Power transistors such as IGBTs and MOSFETs are a source of electromagnetic interference (EMI) during switching due to rapid voltage/current variations. Increasing the switching time can reduce the generation of EMI but increases losses. Several driving methods to reduce EMI have been proposed in the literature. In this work, a driving method based on the control of a grid current profile, made possible by new drivers available on the market, is proposed. This is based on the gate-source voltage of transistor as as a function of the charge injected into the gate. In order to demonstrate the performance of this method, it is evaluated by SPICE simulation using a figure of merit that enables it to be compared quantitatively with a reference method known as CATS (Commande autour de la Tension de Seuil).",
