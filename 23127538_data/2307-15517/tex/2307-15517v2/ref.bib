    abstract = "{This paper describes a new type of minimal floating offshore platform, named MINIFLOAT, suitable for developing deepwater marginal fields. The paper covers the design methodology and hydrodynamic analysis of the platform. The numerical method used to determine the floater dynamics is presented. Results of the platform response are given for a specific case. The platform described in this paper can be used in a number of ways to support various equipment used in the production of oil and gas from deep and ultra-deep water hydrocarbon fields: - support and control to a subsea wellhead, including chemical injection, hydraulic power, telecommunication - host water-injection equipment to assist field production - host first stage separation equipment to allow long offsets to hub/shore - provide power supply to heated flowlines, multiphase pumps or other subsea installations. This new concept enables safe and cost-efficient development of marginal fields in deep and ultra deep water. It allows application of advanced subsea technologies to reduce field development cost, while maintaining a surface "presence" for reduced cost, enhanced reliability and ease of maintenance.As the demand for hydrocarbons in the next 10 years is expected to increase by as much as 5 percent a year, and as very large oil and gas fields are less likely to be found, oil and gas companies are looking into means of developing their proven smaller reserves. Significant exploration activities have taken place in recent years in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico resulting in numerous discoveries. However, many of these fields do not contain sufficiently large amount of oil or gas to justify the expenses of a stand-alone field development, such as a production platform and pipeline infrastructure.}",

    abstract = "Human ability to understand language is \textit{general, flexible, and robust}. In contrast, most NLU models above the word level are designed for a specific task and struggle with out-of-domain data. If we aspire to develop models with understanding beyond the detection of superficial correspondences between inputs and outputs, then it is critical to develop a unified model that can execute a range of linguistic tasks across different domains. To facilitate research in this direction, we present the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE, gluebenchmark.com): a benchmark of nine diverse NLU tasks, an auxiliary dataset for probing models for understanding of specific linguistic phenomena, and an online platform for evaluating and comparing models. For some benchmark tasks, training data is plentiful, but for others it is limited or does not match the genre of the test set. GLUE thus favors models that can represent linguistic knowledge in a way that facilitates sample-efficient learning and effective knowledge-transfer across tasks. While none of the datasets in GLUE were created from scratch for the benchmark, four of them feature privately-held test data, which is used to ensure that the benchmark is used fairly. We evaluate baselines that use ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), a powerful transfer learning technique, as well as state-of-the-art sentence representation models. The best models still achieve fairly low absolute scores. Analysis with our diagnostic dataset yields similarly weak performance over all phenomena tested, with some exceptions.",

We introduce the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA), a set of 10,657 English sentences labeled as grammatical or ungrammatical from published linguistics literature. As baselines, we train several recurrent neural network models on acceptability classification, and find that our models outperform unsupervised models by Lau et al. (2016) on CoLA. Error-analysis on specific grammatical phenomena reveals that both Lau et al.{'}s models and ours learn systematic generalizations like subject-verb-object order. However, all models we test perform far below human level on a wide range of grammatical constructions.",

abstract = {This paper introduces Block Data Representations (BDR), a framework for exploring and evaluating a wide spectrum of narrow-precision formats for deep learning. It enables comparison of popular quantization standards, and through BDR, new formats based on shared microexponents (MX) are identified, which outperform other state-of-the-art quantization approaches, including narrow-precision floating-point and block floating-point. MX utilizes multiple levels of quantization scaling with ultra-fine scaling factors based on shared microexponents in the hardware. The effectiveness of MX is demonstrated on real-world models including large-scale generative pretraining and inferencing, and production-scale recommendation systems.},

abstract = {In response to innovations in machine learning (ML) models, production workloads changed radically and rapidly. TPU v4 is the fifth Google domain specific architecture (DSA) and its third supercomputer for such ML models. Optical circuit switches (OCSes) dynamically reconfigure its interconnect topology to improve scale, availability, utilization, modularity, deployment, security, power, and performance; users can pick a twisted 3D torus topology if desired. Much cheaper, lower power, and faster than Infiniband, OCSes and underlying optical components are <5\% of system cost and <3\% of system power. Each TPU v4 includes SparseCores, dataflow processors that accelerate models that rely on embeddings by 5x--7x yet use only 5\% of die area and power. Deployed since 2020, TPU v4 outperforms TPU v3 by 2.1x and improves performance/Watt by 2.7x. The TPU v4 supercomputer is 4x larger at 4096 chips and thus nearly 10x faster overall, which along with OCS flexibility and availability allows a large language model to train at an average of ~60\% of peak FLOPS/second. For similar sized systems, it is ~4.3x--4.5x faster than the Graphcore IPU Bow and is 1.2x--1.7x faster and uses 1.3x--1.9x less power than the Nvidia A100. TPU v4s inside the energy-optimized warehouse scale computers of Google Cloud use ~2--6x less energy and produce ~20x less CO2e than contemporary DSAs in typical on-premise data centers.},

abstract = {The combination of pre-trained models and task-specific fine-tuning schemes, such as BERT, has achieved great success in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the large memory and computation costs of such models make it challenging to deploy them in edge devices. Moreover, in real-world applications like chatbots, multiple NLP tasks need to be processed together to achieve higher response credibility. Running multiple NLP tasks with specialized models for each task increases the latency and memory cost latency linearly with the number of tasks. Though there have been recent works on parameter-shared tuning that aim to reduce the total parameter size by partially sharing weights among multiple tasks, computation remains intensive and redundant despite different tasks using the same input. In this work, we identify that a significant portion of activations and weights can be reused among different tasks, to reduce cost and latency for efficient multi-task NLP. Specifically, we propose TaskFusion, an efficient transfer learning software-hardware co-design that exploits delta sparsity in both weights and activations to boost data sharing among tasks. For training, TaskFusion uses ℓ1 regularization on delta activation to learn inter-task data redundancies. A novel hardware-aware sub-task inference algorithm is proposed to exploit the dual delta sparsity. We then designed a dedicated heterogeneous architecture to accelerate multi-task inference with an optimized scheduling to increase hardware utilization and reduce off-chip memory access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaskFusion can reduce the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) by over 73\% in multi-task NLP with negligible accuracy loss, while adding a new task at the cost of only < 2\% parameter size increase. With the proposed architecture and optimized scheduling, Task-Fusion can achieve 1.48--2.43\texttimes{} performance and 1.62--3.77\texttimes{} energy efficiency than those using state-of-the-art single-task accelerators for multi-task NLP applications.},

abstract = {Transformer-based language models such as BERT provide significant accuracy improvement to a multitude of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their hefty computational and memory demands make them challenging to deploy to resource-constrained edge platforms with strict latency requirements. We present EdgeBERT, an in-depth algorithm-hardware co-design for latency-aware energy optimizations for multi-task NLP. EdgeBERT employs entropy-based early exit predication in order to perform dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS), at a sentence granularity, for minimal energy consumption while adhering to a prescribed target latency. Computation and memory footprint overheads are further alleviated by employing a calibrated combination of adaptive attention span, selective network pruning, and floating-point quantization. Furthermore, in order to maximize the synergistic benefits of these algorithms in always-on and intermediate edge computing settings, we specialize a 12nm scalable hardware accelerator system, integrating a fast-switching low-dropout voltage regulator (LDO), an all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL), as well as, high-density embedded non-volatile memories (eNVMs) wherein the sparse floating-point bit encodings of the shared multi-task parameters are carefully stored. Altogether, latency-aware multi-task NLP inference acceleration on the EdgeBERT hardware system generates up to 7 \texttimes{}, 2.5 \texttimes{}, and 53 \texttimes{} lower energy compared to the conventional inference without early stopping, the latency-unbounded early exit approach, and CUDA adaptations on an Nvidia Jetson Tegra X2 mobile GPU, respectively.},
