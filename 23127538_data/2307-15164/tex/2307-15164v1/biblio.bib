ABSTRACT = {Research on the analysis of counselling conversations through natural language processing methods has seen remarkable growth in recent years. However, the potential of this field is still greatly limited by the lack of access to publicly available therapy dialogues, especially those with expert annotations, but it has been alleviated thanks to the recent release of AnnoMI, the first publicly and freely available conversation dataset of 133 faithfully transcribed and expert-annotated demonstrations of high- and low-quality motivational interviewing (MI)&mdash;an effective therapy strategy that evokes client motivation for positive change. In this work, we introduce new expert-annotated utterance attributes to AnnoMI and describe the entire data collection process in more detail, including dialogue source selection, transcription, annotation, and post-processing. Based on the expert annotations on key MI aspects, we carry out thorough analyses of AnnoMI with respect to counselling-related properties on the utterance, conversation, and corpus levels. Furthermore, we introduce utterance-level prediction tasks with potential real-world impacts and build baseline models. Finally, we examine the performance of the models on dialogues of different topics and probe the generalisability of the models to unseen topics.},

abstract="The recent pandemic Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to an unexpectedly imposed social isolation, causing an enormous disruption of daily routines for the global community and posing a potential risk to the mental well-being of individuals. However, resources for supporting people with mental health issues remain extremely limited, raising the matter of providing trustworthy and relevant psychotherapeutic content publicly available. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates the application of information retrieval in the mental health domain to automatically filter therapeutical content by estimated quality. We have used AnnoMI, an expert annotated counseling dataset composed of high- and low-quality Motivational Interviewing therapy sessions. First, we applied state-of-the-art information retrieval models to evaluate their applicability in the psychological domain for ranking therapy sessions by estimated quality. Then, given the sensitive psychological information associated with each therapy session, we analyzed the potential risk of unfair outcomes across therapy topics, i.e., mental issues, under a common fairness definition. Our experimental results show that the employed ranking models are reliable for systematically ranking high-quality content above low-quality one, while unfair outcomes across topics are model-dependent and associated low-quality content distribution. Our findings provide preliminary insights for applying information retrieval in the psychological domain, laying the foundations for incorporating publicly available high-quality resources to support mental health.

ABSTRACT = {Virtual users generate a gigantic volume of unbalanced sentiments over various online crowd-sourcing platforms which consist of text, emojis, or a combination of both. Its accurate analysis brings profits to various industries and their services. The state-of-art detects sentiment polarity using common sense with text only. The research work proposes an emoji-based framework for cognitive&ndash;conceptual&ndash;affective computing of sentiment polarity based on the linguistic patterns of text and emojis. The proposed emoji and text-based parser articulates sentiments with proposed linguistic features along with a combination of different emojis to generate the part of speech into n-gram patterns. In this paper, the sentiments of 650 world-famous personages consisting of 1,68,548 tweets have been downloaded from across the world. The results illustrate that the proposed natural language processing framework shows that the existence of emojis in sentiments many times seems to change the overall polarity of the sentiment. By extension, the CLDR name of the emoji is utilized to evaluate the accurate polarity of emoji patterns, and a dictionary of sentiments is adopted for evaluating the polarity of text. Eventually, the performances of three ML classifiers (SVM, DT, and Na&iuml;ve Bayes) are evaluated for proposed distinctive linguistic features. The robust experiments indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the SVM classifier as compared to other ML classifiers. The proposed polarity detection generator has achieved an exceptional perspective of sentiments presented in the sentence by employing the flow of concept established, based on linguistic features, polarity inversion, coordination, and discourse patterns, surpassing the performance of extant state-of-the-art approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {The untraceable part of the Deep Web, also known as the Dark Web, is one of the most used &ldquo;secretive spaces&rdquo; to execute all sorts of illegal and criminal activities by terrorists, cybercriminals, spies, and offenders. Identifying actions, products, and offenders on the Dark Web is challenging due to its size, intractability, and anonymity. Therefore, it is crucial to intelligently enforce tools and techniques capable of identifying the activities of the Dark Web to assist law enforcement agencies as a support system. Therefore, this study proposes four deep learning architectures (RNN, CNN, LSTM, and Transformer)-based classification models using the pre-trained word embedding representations to identify illicit activities related to cybercrimes on Dark Web forums. We used the Agora dataset derived from the DarkNet market archive, which lists 109 activities by category. The listings in the dataset are vaguely described, and several data points are untagged, which rules out the automatic labeling of category items as target classes. Hence, to overcome this constraint, we applied a meticulously designed human annotation scheme to annotate the data, taking into account all the attributes to infer the context. In this research, we conducted comprehensive evaluations to assess the performance of our proposed approach. Our proposed BERT-based classification model achieved an accuracy score of 96%. Given the unbalancedness of the experimental data, our results indicate the advantage of our tailored data preprocessing strategies and validate our annotation scheme. Thus, in real-world scenarios, our work can be used to analyze Dark Web forums and identify cybercrimes by law enforcement agencies and can pave the path to develop sophisticated systems as per the requirements.},

Lack of facial expressions and voice modulations make detecting emotions in text a challenging problem. For instance, as humans, on reading {``}Why don{'}t you ever text me!{''} we can either interpret it as a sad or angry emotion and the same ambiguity exists for machines. However, the context of dialogue can prove helpful in detection of the emotion. In this task, given a textual dialogue i.e. an utterance along with two previous turns of context, the goal was to infer the underlying emotion of the utterance by choosing from four emotion classes - Happy, Sad, Angry and Others. To facilitate the participation in this task, textual dialogues from user interaction with a conversational agent were taken and annotated for emotion classes after several data processing steps. A training data set of 30160 dialogues, and two evaluation data sets, Test1 and Test2, containing 2755 and 5509 dialogues respectively were released to the participants. A total of 311 teams made submissions to this task. The final leader-board was evaluated on Test2 data set, and the highest ranked submission achieved 79.59 micro-averaged F1 score. Our analysis of systems submitted to the task indicate that Bi-directional LSTM was the most common choice of neural architecture used, and most of the systems had the best performance for the Sad emotion class, and the worst for the Happy emotion class.",

We found statistical evidence that the writer{'}s perspective yields superior annotation quality overall.

They differ in several ways: (1) the use of different annotation schemata (e. g., discrete label sets, including joy, anger, fear, or sadness or continuous values including valence, or arousal), (2) the domain, and, (3) the file formats. This leads to several research gaps: supervised models often only use a limited set of available resources. Additionally, no previous work has compared emotion corpora in a systematic manner. We aim at contributing to this situation with a survey of the datasets, and aggregate them in a common file format with a common annotation schema. Based on this aggregation, we perform the first cross-corpus classification experiments in the spirit of future research enabled by this paper, in order to gain insight and a better understanding of differences of models inferred from the data. This work also simplifies the choice of the most appropriate resources for developing a model for a novel domain. One result from our analysis is that a subset of corpora is better classified with models trained on a different corpus. For none of the corpora, training on all data altogether is better than using a subselection of the resources. Our unified corpus is available at http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/unifyemotion.",

We fill this gap by releasing a dataset of 5000 English news headlines annotated via crowdsourcing with their associated emotions, the corresponding emotion experiencers and textual cues, related emotion causes and targets, as well as the reader{'}s perception of the emotion of the headline. This annotation task is comparably challenging, given the large number of classes and roles to be identified. We therefore propose a multiphase annotation procedure in which we first find relevant instances with emotional content and then annotate the more fine-grained aspects. Finally, we develop a baseline for the task of automatic prediction of semantic role structures and discuss the results. The corpus we release enables further research on emotion classification, emotion intensity prediction, emotion cause detection, and supports further qualitative studies.",

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",
