  "abstract": "Miniaturized and rationally assembled nanostructures exhibit extraordinarily distinct physical properties beyond their individual units. This review will focus on structured small-scale optical cavities that show unique electromagnetic near fields and collective optical coupling. By harnessing different material systems and structural designs, various light-matter interactions can be engineered, such as nanoscale lasing, nonlinear optics, exciton-polariton coupling, and energy harvesting. Key device performance of nanoscale lasers, including low power threshold, optical multiplexing, and electrical pump, will be discussed. This review will also cover emerging applications of nanoscale optical cavities in quantum engineering and topological photonics. Structured nanocavities can serve as a scalable platform for integrated photonic circuits and hybrid quantum photonic systems.",
