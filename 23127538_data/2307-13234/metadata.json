  "abstract": "GRANDProto300 is a 300-antenna prototype array of the envisioned GRAND (Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) project. The goal of GRANDProto300 is to detect radio signals emitted by cosmic ray-induced air showers, with energies ranging from $10^{16.5}$~eV to $10^{18.5}$~eV, which covers the transition region between Galactic and extragalactic sources. We use simulations to optimize the layout of GRANDProto300 and develop a shower reconstruction method. Based on them, we present the performance of GRANDProto300 for cosmic-ray detection, by means of its effective area, angular resolution, and energy resolution.",
