  abstract = {The sensitivity of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation to different array geometries motivates the design of optimal sensor constellations. We propose a framework for array geometry design for a linear array with fixed aperture and fixed inter-element spacing, where the array geometry design is formulated as a sensor selection problem. The sensor selection is performed such that it achieves a desired Crame\textasciiacute r-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the DOA of a single source. The nonuniformity of the sensor selection typically results in sidelobes. These sidelobes are suppressed in a specified angular sector again via sensor selection. The aforementioned problems are jointly casted as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem which can be efficiently solved in polynomial time. Simulations exhibit the trade-offs among the number of selected sensors, sidelobe minimization, and CRB of the DOA estimates.},

  abstract = {Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is known for its superiority over conventional radar due to its antenna and waveform diversity. Although higher angular resolution, improved parameter identifiability, and better target detection are achieved, the hardware costs (due to multiple transmitters and multiple receivers) and high-energy consumption (multiple pulses) limit the usage of MIMO radars in large scale networks. On one hand, higher angle and velocity estimation accuracy is required, but on the other hand, a lower number of antennas/pulses is desirable. To achieve such a compromise, in this paper, the Crame\textasciiacute r\textendash Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the angle and velocity estimator is employed as a performance metric to design the antenna and the pulse placement. It is shown that the CRLB derived for two targets is a more appropriate criterion in comparison with the single-target CRLB since the two-target CRLB takes into account both the mainlobe width and the sidelobe level of the ambiguity function. In this paper, several algorithms for antenna and pulse selection based on convex and submodular optimization are proposed. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the developed theory.},

The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the estimation problems is derived, and some useful properties of the CRB covariance matrix are established. The relationship between the MUSIC and ML estimators is investigated as well. A numerical study is reported of the statistical efficiency of the MUSIC estimator for the problem of finding the directions of two plane waves using a uniform linear array. An exact description of the results is included.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {The problem of choosing the best subset of sensors that guarantees a certain estimation performance is referred to as sensor selection. In this paper, we focus on observations that are related to a general non-linear model. The proposed framework is valid as long as the observations are independent, and its likelihood satisfies the regularity conditions. We use several functions of the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) as a performance measure. We formulate the sensor selection problem as the design of a sparse vector, which in its original form is a nonconvex {$\mathscr{l}$}0-(quasi) norm optimization problem. We present relaxed sensor selection solvers that can be efficiently solved in polynomial time. The proposed solvers result in sparse sensing techniques. We also propose a projected subgradient algorithm that is attractive for large-scale problems. The developed theory is applied to sensor placement for localization.},
