  "abstract": "In a system of point vortices, there exist regions of stability around each vortex, even if the system is chaotic. These regions are usually called stability islands and they have a morphology that is hard to characterise. We study and characterise them in two point vortex systems in the infinite two-dimensional plane -- the simplest scenario -- by studying the dynamics of passive particles in these environments. We present computations for the perimeter and area of these islands and highlight the analytical expressions that define their boundary.",
