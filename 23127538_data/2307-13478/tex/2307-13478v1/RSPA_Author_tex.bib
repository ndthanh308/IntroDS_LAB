The control action is exercised by generating one vortex - specified by its location and respective circulation - at a chosen time, and by varying the exposure of the particle to each one of the vortices in continuum time. A control multi-process framework is chosen in order to derive necessary conditions of optimality in the form of a Maximum Principle of Pontryagin. These conditions provide relations that suffice to fully determine the optimal control process."

Following a comprehensive review of earlier approaches, we discuss how methods of modern control and optimization theory can be employed to solve control problems for vortex systems. In addition, we address the companion problem of the state estimation for vortex systems. While most of the discussion concerns point vortex systems, in the second part of the article we also introduce a novel approach to the control of Euler flows involving finite-area vorticity distributions. The article concludes with what, in the author's opinion, represent promising new research directions.}

@article{GallayWayne,
	Abstract = {Both experimental and numerical studies of fluid motion indicate that initially localized regions of vorticity tend to evolve into isolated vortices and that these vortices then serve as organizing centers for the flow. In this paper we prove that in two dimensions localized regions of vorticity do evolve toward a vortex. More precisely we prove that any solution of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation whose initial vorticity distribution is integrable converges to an explicit self-similar solution called ``Oseen's vortex''. This implies that the Oseen vortices are dynamically stable for all values of the circulation Reynolds number, and our approach also shows that these vortices are the only solutions of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation with a Dirac mass as initial vorticity. Finally, under slightly stronger assumptions on the vorticity distribution, we give precise estimates on the rate of convergence toward the vortex.},

	Abstract = {We consider the inviscid limit for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equation in the particular case where the initial flow is a finite collection of point vortices. We suppose that the initial positions and the circulations of the vortices do not depend on the viscosity parameter ν, and we choose a time T > 0 such that the Helmholtz--Kirchhoff point vortex system is well-posed on the interval {$[$}0, T{$]$}. Under these assumptions, we prove that the solution of the Navier--Stokes equation converges, as ν→0, to a superposition of Lamb--Oseen vortices whose centers evolve according to a viscous regularization of the point vortex system. Convergence holds uniformly in time, in a strong topology which allows us to give an accurate description of the asymptotic profile of each individual vortex. In particular, we compute to leading order the deformations of the vortices due to mutual interactions. This makes it possible to estimate the self-interactions, which play an important role in the convergence proof.},

A system with one or more positive Lyapunov exponents is defined to be chaotic. Our method is rooted conceptually in a previously developed technique that could only be applied to analytically defined model systems: we monitor the long-term growth rate of small volume elements in an attractor. The method is tested on model systems with known Lyapunov spectra, and applied to data for the Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction and Couette-Taylor flow."

Lyapunov exponents quantify the exponential divergence of initially close state-space trajectories and estimate the amount of chaos in a system. We present a new method for calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent from an experimental time series. The method follows directly from the definition of the largest Lyapunov exponent and is accurate because it takes advantage of all the available data. We show that the algorithm is fast, easy to implement, and robust to changes in the following quantities: embedding dimension, size of data set, reconstruction delay, and noise level. Furthermore, one may use the algorithm to calculate simultaneously the correlation dimension. Thus, one sequence of computations will yield an estimate of both the level of chaos and the system complexity."

It has been shown that a modification of the neural network method makes it possible to compute a spectrum of Lyapunov exponents, and then to detect a transition of the system regular dynamics into chaos, hyperchaos, and others. The aim of the comparison was to evaluate the considered algorithms, study their convergence, and also identify the most suitable algorithms for specific system types and objectives. Moreover, an algorithm of calculation of the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents based on a trained neural network has been proposed. It has been proven that the developed method yields good results for different types of systems and does not require a priori knowledge of the system equations.",

We also find that the logarithms of the duration of this chaotic behavior and the kinematic viscosity coefficient seem to be connected by a linear relationship. Most approaches to control of point vortices don't take viscosity into account. However, viscosity exists in most real fluids. As such, it is important to take it into account to try to obtain better descriptions of real world problems.",
