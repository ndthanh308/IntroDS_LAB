  "abstract": "The Hankel determinant $H_{2,1}(F_{f^{-1}}/2)$ of logarithmic coefficients is defined as: \\begin{align*} H_{2,1}(F_{f^{-1}}/2):= \\begin{vmatrix} Γ_1 & Γ_2 Γ_2 & Γ_3 \\end{vmatrix}=Γ_1Γ_3-Γ^2_2, \\end{align*} where $Γ_1, Γ_2,$ and $Γ_3$ are the first, second and third logarithmic coefficients of inverse functions belonging to the class $\\mathcal{S}$ of normalized univalent functions. In this article, we establish sharp inequalities $|H_{2,1}(F_{f^{-1}}/2)|\\leq 19/288$, $|H_{2,1}(F_{f^{-1}}/2)| \\leq 1/144$, and $|H_{2,1}(F_{f^{-1}}/2)| \\leq 1/36$ for the logarithmic coefficients of inverse functions, considering starlike and convex functions, as well as functions with bounded turning of order $1/2$, respectively.",
