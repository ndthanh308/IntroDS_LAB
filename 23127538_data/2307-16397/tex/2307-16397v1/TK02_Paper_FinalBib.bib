Here, we demonstrate a two-point coupled lithium niobate (LN) racetrack micro-resonator that enables us to electro-optically traverse a full set of the zero-, under-, critical-, and over-coupling regimes with minimized disturbance of the intrinsic properties of the resonant mode. The modulation between the zero- and critical-coupling conditions cost a resonant frequency shift of only ∼344.2 MHz and rarely changed the intrinsic quality ( Q ) factor of 4.6 × 10 5 .

The ability to correct their spectral features post-fabrication is required to enable their commercialization. Here, we report and demonstrate an MRM that uses a tunable two-point coupling scheme, which maintains the MRM's compact footprint (60 µm×45 µm) and allows one to tune the MRM's operating wavelength and adjust the optical bandwidth (and/or extinction ratio). This means that one can compensate for fabrication errors and thereby improve the yields. We confirm the modulator's operation by showing NRZ and PAM-4 modulation, up to 28 Gb/s and 19.9 Gb/s, respectively. Also, the proposed tunable MRM maintains the microring's free-spectral range (FSR), which proves its compatibility for configurable and high-bandwidth DWDM applications.},

   abstract = {We study theoretically the interaction between two photons in a nonlinear cavity. The photons are absorbed into the cavity by an effective tuning of its input-output coupling via external control of a coupling to a second, strongly output-coupled cavity mode. Such "dynamically coupled" cavities, which can be implemented using bulk χ (2) and χ (3) nonlinearities, enable incoming photon wave packets to be absorbed into the cavity with high fidelity when the duration of the control is similar to that of the wave packets. Further, this configuration can be used to avoid limitations in the photon-photon interaction time set by the delay-bandwidth product of passive cavities and enables the elimination of wave-packet distortions caused by dispersive cavity transmission and reflection. We consider three kinds of nonlinearities, two arising from χ (2) and χ (3) materials and one due to an interaction with a two-level emitter. To analyze the input and output of few-photon wave packets, we use a Schrödinger-picture formalism in which traveling-wave fields are discretized into infinitesimal time bins. We suggest that dynamically coupled cavities provide a very useful tool for improving the performance of quantum devices relying on cavity-enhanced light-matter interactions such as single-photon sources and atomlike quantum memories with photon interfaces. As an example, we present simulation results showing that high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates may be constructed using any of the considered nonlinear interactions.},

In this paper we mainly consider systems in which the signals (optical intensities) and coupling coefficients are nonnegative quantities; these systems fit well in the theory of positive systems. We use this theory to conclude, for example, that for such systems the pole of the system transfer function with the largest magnitude is simple and positive-valued (in the Z-plane), and that the magnitude of the frequency response can nowhere exceed its value at the origin. We also discuss the effects of various noise phenomena on the performance of fiber-optic signal processors, particularly considering the effects of laser source phase fluctuations. Experimental results are presented showing that the dynamic range of the fiber systems, discussed in this paper, is limited, not by the laser source intensity noise or shot noise, but by the laser phase-induced intensity noise. Mathematical analyses of lattice structures as well as additional applications are also presented. Copyright © 1984 by The lnstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.},

However, the symmetry of such mode structures limits the conversion efficiency to 50% due to the equal probability of up- and down-conversion. Here, we demonstrate how two coupled microrings enable highly directional conversion between the spectral modes of one of the rings. An extinction between up- and down-conversion of more than 40 dB is experimentally observed. Based on this method, we propose a design for on-chip multiplexed single-photon sources that probabilistically generate photon pairs across many frequency modes of a ring resonator and subsequently convert them to a single frequency - thereby enabling quasi-deterministic photon emission. Our numerical analysis shows that once a photon is generated, it can be converted and emitted into a wave packet having a 90% overlap with a Gaussian with 99% efficiency for a ratio between intrinsic and coupling quality factors of 400.},

The cavity end-mirrors determine the performance of the coupled system, with higher mirror reflectivity yielding better quantum coherence, but higher mirror transparency giving improved measurement and control, forcing a compromise. An alternative is to control the mirror transparency, enabling switching between long photon lifetime during quantum interactions and large signal strength when performing measurements. Here we demonstrate the superconducting analogue, using a quantum system comprising a resonator and a qubit, with variable coupling to a measurement transmission line. The coupling can be adjusted through zero to a photon emission rate 1,000 times the intrinsic photon decay rate. We use this system to control photons in coherent states as well as in non-classical Fock states, and dynamically shape the waveform of released photons. This has direct applications to circuit quantum electrodynamics [3], and may enable high-fidelity quantum state transfer between distant qubits, for which precisely-controlled waveform shaping is a critical and non-trivial requirement [4, 5].},

   abstract = {We study theoretically the interaction between two photons in a nonlinear cavity. The photons are loaded into the cavity via a method we propose here, in which the input/output coupling of the cavity is effectively controlled via a tunable coupling to a second cavity mode that is itself strongly output-coupled. Incoming photon wave packets can be loaded into the cavity with high fidelity when the timescale of the control is smaller than the duration of the wave packets. Dynamically coupled cavities can be used to avoid limitations in the photon-photon interaction time set by the delay-bandwidth product of passive cavities. Additionally, they enable the elimination of wave packet distortions caused by dispersive cavity transmission and reflection. We consider three kinds of nonlinearities, those arising from $\chi^\{\scriptscriptstyle(2)\}$ and $\chi^\{\scriptscriptstyle(3)\}$ materials and that due to an interaction with a two-level emitter. To analyze the input and output of few-photon wave packets we use a Schr\"odinger-picture formalism in which travelling-wave fields are discretized into infinitesimal time-bins. We suggest that dynamically coupled cavities provide a very useful tool for improving the performance of quantum devices relying on cavity-enhanced light-matter interactions such as single-photon sources and atom-like quantum memories with photon interfaces. As an example, we present simulation results showing that high fidelity two-qubit entangling gates may be constructed using any of the considered nonlinear interactions.},
