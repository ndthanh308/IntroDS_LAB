\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduce in this article \ac{DiffNC}, an extension of \ac{NC}, by showing that the (min,plus)-algebraic terms derived by \ac{NC} are differentiable.
The term bounding the end-to-end delay of a flow can already be differentiated w.r.t. to curve parameters or flow priorities.
However, our approach also allows for network design and synthesis.

We investigate the optimization of flow paths and priority assignment, a task known to be difficult due to its combinatorial nature.
An extension of \ac{NC} models to include alternative flow paths allows to differentiate w.r.t. these.
We show that \ac{DiffNC} with variable relaxation is able to reformulate the optimization problem as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem that can be optimized using gradient-based methods.
Our numerical evaluation shows that \ac{DiffNC} with Frank-Wolfe can reduce the average delay bounds by \SI{39.2}{\percent} compared to shortest path routing.

We also show that our approach is able to scale to industrial networks.
We demonstrate that \ac{DiffNC} with Frank-Wolfe is able to optimize the \acl{AFDX} network from the Airbus A350 in a matter of seconds, outperforming \ac{DiffNC} with \acl{SLSQP} by several orders of magnitude.
Furthermore, a comparison with other optimization methods for combinatorial and nonlinear optimization shows that \ac{DiffNC} can outperform global search methods.
