  "abstract": "Let $p$ be a rational prime, and let $X$ be a connected finite graph. In this article we study voltage covers $X_\\infty$ of $X$ attached to a voltage assignment $α$ which takes values in some uniform $p$-adic Lie group $G$. We formulate and prove an Iwasawa main conjecture for the projective limit of the Picard groups $\\text{Pic}(X_n)$ of the intermediate voltage covers $X_n$, ${n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, and we prove one inclusion of a main conjecture for the projective limit of the Jacobians $J(X_n)$.\n  Moreover, we study the $\\mathfrak{M}_H(G)$-property of $\\mathbb{Z}_p[[G]]$-modules and prove a necessary condition for this property which involves the $μ$-invariants of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-subcovers ${Y \\subseteq X_\\infty}$ of $X$. If the dimension of $G$ is equal to 2, then this condition is also sufficient.",
