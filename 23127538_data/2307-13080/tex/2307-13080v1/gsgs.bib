  abstract  = {This work deals with the problem of gathering n oblivious mobile entities, called robots, at a point (not known beforehand) placed on an infinite triangular grid. The robots are considered to be myopic, i.e., robots have limited visibility. Earlier works of gathering mostly considered the robots either on a plane or on a circle or on a rectangular grid under both full and limited visibility. In the triangular grid, there are two works to the best of our knowledge. The first one is by Cicerone et al. [ICDCN'2021] on arbitrary pattern formation where full visibility is considered. The other one by Shibata et al. [IPDPS(W)'2021] which considers seven robots with 2-hop visibility that form a hexagon with one robot in the center of the hexagon in a collision-less environment under a fully synchronous scheduler.},

In this paper, we give an LLP algorithm for the Housing Market problem. The Housing Market problem is a one-sided matching problem with n agents and n houses. Each agent has an initial allocation of a house and a totally ordered preference list of houses. The goal is to find a matching between agents and houses such that no strict subset of agents can improve their outcome by exchanging houses with each other rather than going with the matching. Gale's celebrated Top Trading Cycle algorithm to find the matching requires {\$}{\$}O(n^2){\$}{\$}O(n2)time. Our parallel algorithm has expected time complexity {\$}{\$}O(n {\backslash}log ^2 n){\$}{\$}O(nlog2n)with and expected work complexity of {\$}{\$}O(n^2 {\backslash}log n){\$}{\$}O(n2logn).},

Given a multiset F of grid vertices such that |R| = |F|, APF asks for a distributed algorithm that moves robots so as to reach a configuration similar to F. Similarity means that robots must be disposed as F regardless of translations, rotations, reflections. So far, as possible discretization of the Euclidean plane only the standard square grid has been considered in the context of the classical Look-Compute-Move model. However, it is natural to consider the other regular tessellation graphs, that are triangular and hexagonal grids. For any regular tessellation graph, we provide a resolution algorithm for APF when the initial configuration is asymmetric.},

  abstract       = {We consider the distributed setting of N autonomous mobile robots that operate in Look-Compute-Move (LCM) cycles following the well-celebrated classic oblivious robots model. We study the fundamental problem of gathering N autonomous robots on a plane, which requires all robots to meet at a single point (or to position within a small area) that is not known beforehand. We consider limited visibility under which robots are only able to see other robots up to a constant Euclidean distance and focus on the time complexity of gathering by robots under limited visibility. There exists an O(DG) time algorithm for this problem in the fully synchronous setting, assuming that the robots agree on one coordinate axis (say north), where DG is the diameter of the visibility graph of the initial configuration. In this article, we provide the first O(DE) time algorithm for this problem in the asynchronous setting under the same assumption of robots’ agreement with one coordinate axis, where DE is the Euclidean distance between farthest-pair of robots in the initial configuration. The runtime of our algorithm is a significant improvement since for any initial configuration of N≥1 robots, DE≤DG, and there exist initial configurations for which DG can be quadratic on DE, i.e., DG=Θ(DE2). Moreover, our algorithm is asymptotically time-optimal since the trivial time lower bound for this problem is Ω(DE).},

  abstract = {The paper studies the gathering problem on grid and tree networks. A team of robots placed at different nodes of the input graph, has to meet at some node and remain there. Robots operate in Look–Compute–Move cycles; in one cycle, a robot perceives the current configuration in terms of occupied nodes (Look), decides whether to move toward one of its neighbors (Compute), and in the positive case makes the computed move instantaneously (Move). Cycles are performed asynchronously for each robot. The problem has been deeply studied for the case of ring networks. However, the known techniques used on rings cannot be directly extended to grids and trees. Moreover, on rings, another assumption concerning the so-called multiplicity detection capability was required in order to accomplish the gathering task. That is, a robot is able to detect during its Look operation whether a node is empty, or occupied by one robot, or occupied by an undefined number of robots greater than one. In this paper, we provide a full characterization about gatherable configurations for grids and trees. In particular, we show that on these topologies, the multiplicity detection is not required. Very interestingly, sometimes the problem appears trivial, as it is for the case of grids with both odd sides, while sometimes the involved techniques require new insights with respect to the well-studied ring case. Moreover, our results reveal the importance of structures like grids and trees that allow to overcome the multiplicity detection with respect to the ring case.},

Previous investigations have focused mostly on the unlimited visibility setting, where each robot can always see all the others regardless of their distance. In the more difficult and realistic setting where the robots have limited visibility, the existing algorithmic results are only for convergence (towards a common point, without ever reaching it) and only for semi-synchronous environments, where robots’ movements are assumed to be performed instantaneously. In contrast, we study this problem in a totally asynchronous setting, where robots’ actions, computations, and movements require a finite but otherwise unpredictable amount of time. We present a protocol that allows anonymous oblivious robots with limited visibility to gather in the same location in finite time, provided they have orientation (i.e., agreement on a coordinate system). Our result indicates that, with respect to gathering, orientation is at least as powerful as instantaneous movements.},

In this problem, n robots are placed in an n node graph arbitrarily and must coordinate with each other to reach a final configuration such that exactly one robot is at each node. We study this problem through the lenses of minimizing the memory required by each robot and of minimizing the number of rounds required to achieve dispersion.Dispersion is of interest due to its relationship to the problems of scattering on a graph, exploration using mobile robots, and load balancing on a graph. Additionally, dispersion has an immediate real world application due to its relationship to the problem of recharging electric cars, as each car can be considered a robot and recharging stations and the roads connecting them nodes and edges of a graph respectively. Since recharging is a costly affair relative to traveling, we want to distribute these cars amongst the various available recharge points where communication should be limited to car-to-car interactions.We provide lower bounds on both the memory required for robots to achieve dispersion and the minimum running time to achieve dispersion on any type of graph. We then analyze the trade-offs between time and memory for various types of graphs. We provide time optimal and memory optimal algorithms for several types of graphs and show the power of a little memory in terms of running time.},

The robots are assumed to be autonomous, identical, anonymous and oblivious. They operate in Look-Compute-Move cycles under a fully asynchronous scheduler. The robots do not have access to any common global coordinate system. However, the grid allows the robots to have a partial agreement on coordinate system as they can align the axes of their local coordinate systems along the grid lines.

  abstract = {One of the recently considered models of robot-based computing makes use of identical, memoryless mobile units placed in nodes of an anonymous graph. The robots operate in Look–Compute–Move cycles; in one cycle, a robot takes a snapshot of the current configuration (Look), takes a decision whether to stay idle or to move to one of the nodes adjacent to its current position (Compute), and in the latter case makes an instantaneous move to this neighbor (Move). Cycles are performed asynchronously for each robot. In such a restricted scenario, we study the influence of symmetries of the robot configuration on the feasibility of certain computational tasks. More precisely, we deal with the problem of gathering all robots at one node of the graph, and propose a solution based on a symmetry-preserving strategy. When the considered graph is an undirected ring and the number of robots is sufficiently large (more than 18), such an approach is proved to solve the problem for all starting situations, as long as gathering is feasible. In this way we also close the open problem of characterizing symmetric situations on the ring which admit a gathering [R. Klasing, E. Markou, A. Pelc: Gathering asynchronous oblivious mobile robots in a ring, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 390 (1) (2008) 27–39]. The proposed symmetry-preserving approach, which is complementary to symmetry-breaking techniques found in related work, appears to be new and may have further applications in robot-based computing.},
