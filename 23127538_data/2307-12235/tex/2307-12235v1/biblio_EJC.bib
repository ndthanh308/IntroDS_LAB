This makes it possible for network consensus problems to design and estimate the convergence time off-line. Finally, simulation is included to demonstrate the performance of the new protocols."

Adaptive quantized controllers are proposed by employing backstepping technique. It is proved that, with our proposed strategy, all signals of the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded, and the formation tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small residual set. Simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

A variable transformation is firstly given to convert the formation tracking problem into the consensus-like issue. Then a novel type of distributed event-triggered control strategy is proposed under fixed topology and switching topology, which can guarantee multi-robot systems to produce desired geometric configuration from arbitrary initial positions and orientations for each robot, while the centroid of formation can follow one dynamic reference trajectory. Moreover, the novel event-triggering conditions under fixed topology and switching topology, which only need intermittent interaction between neighboring robots, are designed to assist the execution of distributed controllers. Based on the designed event-triggering conditions, the robot systems can effectively reduce the communication cost, energy consumption and mechanical wear, especially when the quantity of robots is huge. Finally, the effectiveness of theoretical results is illustrated by some numerical examples."

The dynamics of the resulted cooperative relay-pursuit network are described by a novel model of impulsive systems. As a result, to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop network system, the controllers? gains are chosen effectively using the solution of an algebraic Riccati equation. The proof of the stability is based on the construction of a switched Lyapunov function. We also show that the proposed controller is able to deal with delays if some sufficient conditions in the form of a set of linear inequalities are satisfied.

An optimally distributed method is developed by matrix transformation method and linear quadratic regulator theory, which leads to an optimisation on both horizontal and vertical control. For obstacle avoidance, a non-quadratic cost function is introduced based on optimal control. The resulting closed-loop mixed-order system is validated to be stable with an optimal performance.

A novel formation control algorithm suitable for both leaders and followers is designed, in which leaders are implicitly integrated into the swarm and can be influenced by navigational feedback from their flockmates. Theoretical analysis shows that the system is asymptotically stable and can converge to the desired formation without collision among vehicles. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical results and verify the velocity and trajectory tracking abilities of the algorithm. Results reveal that the proposed algorithm guarantees a swarm of UAVs to fly with predefined formation and track scheduled trajectory. Furthermore, the novel algorithm can reduce the communication consumption and enhance the adaptability and scalability of the system."

The traditional approaches to multi-robot exploration problem are all based on the ``pre-designed'' cooperation strategy. However, many real-world settings are too complex for humans to ``design'' effective strategies. Besides, ``pre-designed'' strategy does not possess the ability to adapt to different task environment features, which also limits its application in real-world practices. Inspired by the superiority of deep reinforcement learning technique on complex individual behavior design, we apply the same technology to the cooperative learning process on the robot collective level. Our approach has been evaluated in a simulated multi-robot Disaster Exploration scenario and the results show that it could be applied in more complicated scenarios in contrast with two traditional ``human-designed'' methods.",

	abstract = "Wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSN) can be used in a wide range of applications such as monitoring agriculture, infrastructures, military operations, disaster management and so on. Energy conservation is a major concern in WMSN applications. This paper proposes a multi-agent based context-aware information gathering using WMSN for monitoring agriculture. Three kinds of contexts are considered in this paper such as detecting an emergency, temporal and computational contexts for detection of diseased plants, weeds, fire and interpret the soil fertility based on the soil parameters. This work considers contexts driven by a sensor node. Whenever the context is detected the information will be sent to the sink node. The proposed scheme works as follows: Every sensor senses the information and updates the node knowledge base. Based on the sensed information node interprets the context such as disease affected plants, soil fertility, fire, and growth of weeds. The sensor nodes begin to transmit the stored information to the cluster heads with the help of Path Finding Agent (PFA). Cluster heads aggregate the information received by the sensor nodes in the field before sending this information with the help of Querry Agent (QA) to the sink node. At the sink node all the information will be sent to the end-user, but in case of the fire detection, the immediate action will be taken by the sink node itself to turn on the sprinklers. Once the sensor finishes the assigned task (sensing, communicating) then automatically it goes into sleep mode. To detect plant disease and weeds, content-based image retrieval is used to compare with the healthy or useful plant images respectively. For performance analysis, the proposed scheme is simulated using NS2. Some of the performance parameters considered in this work are context detection time, delay, fusion time and energy consumption."

We study the symmetric rendezvous search problem in unknown planar environments with polygonal obstacles. In the symmetric version of the problem, the robots must execute the same rendezvous strategy. We consider the case where the initial distance between the robots is unknown, and the robot is unaware of its and the other robots' locations in the environment. We first design a symmetric rendezvous strategy for two robots and perform its theoretical analysis. We prove that the competitive ratio of our strategy is O(d/D). Here, d is the initial distance between the robots and D is the length of the sides of the square robots. In unknown polygonal environments, robots should explore the environment to achieve rendezvous. Therefore, we propose a coverage algorithm that guarantees the complete coverage of the environment. Next, we extend our symmetric rendezvous strategy to n robots and prove that its competitive ratio is O(d/(nD)). Here, d is the maximal pairwise distance between the robots. Finally, we validate our algorithms in simulations."

	ABSTRACT = {This paper studies the problem of generating cooperative feasible paths for formation rendezvous of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Cooperative path-planning for multi-UAV formation rendezvous is mostly a complicated multi-objective optimization problem with many coupled constraints. In order to satisfy the kinematic constraints, i.e., the maximum curvature constraint and the requirement of continuous curvature of the UAV path, the Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curve is adopted as the parameterized path because of its curvature continuity and rational intrinsic properties. Inspired by the co-evolutionary theory, a distributed cooperative particle swarm optimization (DCPSO) algorithm with an elite keeping strategy is proposed to generate a flyable and safe path for each UAV. This proposed algorithm can meet the kinematic constraints of UAVs and the cooperation requirements among UAVs. Meanwhile, the optimal or sub-optimal paths can be obtained. Finally, numerical simulations in 2-D and 3-D environments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and stability of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the paths generated by the proposed DCPSO can not only meet the kinematic constraints of UAVs and safety requirements, but also achieve the simultaneous arrival and collision avoidance between UAVs for formation rendezvous. Compared with the cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA), the proposed DCPSO has better stability and a higher searching success rate.}

	abstract = "The aim of this paper is cooperative task assignment to multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for load transportation. The main goal is to transport a slung load safely with minimal swing. To this end, for each UAV, which is regarded as an agent, a distributed controller is proposed. The proposed controller guarantees a fixed formation, which in turn achieves the main objective. A model of the system is obtained using the Udwadia?Kalaba method for an arbitrary number of UAVs and one slung load with ropes. This method leads to a novel multi-agent system model with interactions between neighbor and non-neighbor agents. The control law is then proposed based on sub-optimal LQR-PID for the extended system. Simulation results are presented to verify the ability of the proposed method to keep the formation of the agents, and to guide the load in the desired direction."

We focus our study on the intersection behaviour, using intelligent agents to represent the infrastructure elements, which cooperate among each other in order to minimize traffic congestion. While the agents are capable of cooperating among themselves, the cooperative behaviour is not pre-defined, as it emerges from the agent interactions at a local level. We also explain our results from simulation experiments involving the proposed mechanism, comparing it with other traffic congestion regulation systems currently in use."

This paper introduces a new coordinate-free, bearing-based algorithm to enable rendezvous of distributed mobile robots at any designated leader robot node using hierarchical tracking of wireless network topology. An assumption is made that the robot can only sense and communicate with their neighbors (i.e., local sensing). The proposed approach preserves connectivity during the rendezvous task, adapts to dynamic changes in the network topology (e.g., losing or re-gaining a communication link), and is tolerant of mobility faults in the robots. We theoretically analyze the proposed algorithm and experimentally demonstrate the approach through simulations and extensive field experiments. The results indicate that the method is effective in a variety of realistic scenarios in which the robots are distributed in a cluttered environment."

Then, a new class of observer-based control algorithms are designed for achieving finite-time consensus tracking in multi-agent systems with a single active leader, where each agent can only share its position states with its neighbors. Within the same context, the present control algorithms are then extended to solve the finite-time containment tracking problem for multi-agent systems in the presence of multiple active leaders. It is theoretically shown that the position states of the followers will converge to that of the leader or a convex hull spanned by those of the leaders, respectively, in finite time. Furthermore, the finite-time formation control problem is discussed. The effectiveness of the results is also illustrated by numerical simulations."

In this framework, we divide the formation information into two independent parts, namely, the global information and the local information. The global formation information decides the geometric pattern of the desired formation. Furthermore, it is assumed that only a small number of agents, which are responsible for the navigation of the whole team, can obtain the global formation information, and the other agents regulate their positions by the local information in a distributed manner. This approach can greatly reduce the data exchange and can easily realize various kinds of complex formations. As a theoretical preparation, we first propose a class of nonlinear consensus protocols, which ensures that the related states of all agents will reach an agreement in a finite time under suitable conditions. And then we apply these consensus protocols to the formation control, including time-invariant formation, time-varying formation and trajectory tracking, respectively. It is shown that all agents will maintain the expected formation in a finite time. Finally, several simulations are worked out to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results."

For agents modeled by double integrators, the proposed controllers allow all agents to both achieve the same velocity and reach a desired shape in finite time. All controllers are totally distributed. Simulations are also provided to validate the proposed control."

The stability analysis in this paper reveals that the local asymptotic stability does not require the infinitesimal rigidity of the formations. Second, on the basis of the topological equivalence of a dissipative Hamiltonian system and a gradient system, we show that the local asymptotic stability of undirected formations of double-integrator modeled agents in n-dimensional space is achieved under a gradient-like control law.

abstract="In this chapter we present a popular class of distributed algorithms, known as linear consensus algorithms, which have the ability to compute the global average of local quantities. These algorithms are particularly suitable in the context of multi-agent systems and networked control systems, i.e. control systems that are physically distributed and cooperate by exchanging information through a communication network. We present the main results available in the literature about the analysis and design of linear consensus algorithms,for both synchronous and asynchronous implementations. We then show that many control, optimization and estimation problems such as least squares, sensor calibration, vehicle coordination and Kalman filtering can be cast as the computation of some sort of averages, therefore being suitable for consensus algorithms. We finally conclude by presenting very recent studies about the performance of many of these control and estimation problems, which give rise to novel metrics for the consensus algorithms. These indexes of performance are rather different from more traditional metrics like the rate of convergence and have fundamental consequences on the design of consensus algorithms.",

Empirical evidence suggests that a predisposition to favor in-groups can be easily triggered by even arbitrary group distinctions and that preferential cooperation within groups occurs even when it is individually costly. The authors study the emergence and robustness of ethnocentric behaviors of in-group favoritism, using an agent-based evolutionary model. They show that such behaviors can become widespread under a broad range of conditions and can support very high levels of cooperation, even in one-move prisoner?s dilemma games. When cooperation is especially costly to individuals, the authors show how ethnocentrism itself can be necessary to sustain cooperation. }

abstract = "State estimation is a statistical method used to obtain accurate estimates of system operating states. It has been used to provide essential operating data for analysis, control and optimization in various energy supply systems. In a combined heat and power system, it is impractical to perform a state estimation procedure in a pool due to the information gap between the different energy sectors. To handle this problem, a decentralized state estimation algorithm based on the asynchronous alternating direction method of multipliers for a whole combined heat and power system is proposed. A dynamic state estimation model for a combined heat and power system is formulated considering the spatiotemporal quasidynamics of the network of heating pipelines. A framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is then proposed to solve the state estimation model in a decentralized way. First, an alternating estimation strategy is employed to solve district heating network subproblems to address the nondifferentiable and nonlinear constraints involved. Second, an asynchronous framework is employed to implement the alternating direction method of multipliers to reduce the idle time in the calculation of the subproblems and improve the overall computational efficiency. Case studies show that the proposed algorithm can still provide accurate estimates of the states of the integrated system even though it is decentralized. Compared to the standard implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers, the proposed framework offers improved computational efficiency."

journal = {The International Journal of Robotics Research},
volume = {34},
number = {1},
pages = {105-128},
year = {2015},
abstract = { This work proposes a fully decentralized strategy for maintaining the formation rigidity of a multi-robot system using only range measurements, while still allowing the graph topology to change freely over time. In this direction, a first contribution of this work is an extension of rigidity theory to weighted frameworks and the rigidity eigenvalue, which when positive ensures the infinitesimal rigidity of the framework. We then propose a distributed algorithm for estimating a common relative position reference frame amongst a team of robots with only range measurements in addition to one agent endowed with the capability of measuring the bearing to two other agents. This first estimation step is embedded into a subsequent distributed algorithm for estimating the rigidity eigenvalue associated with the weighted framework. The estimate of the rigidity eigenvalue is finally used to generate a local control action for each agent that both maintains the rigidity property and enforces additional constraints such as collision avoidance and sensing/communication range limits and occlusions. As an additional feature of our approach, the communication and sensing links among the robots are also left free to change over time while preserving rigidity of the whole framework. The proposed scheme is then experimentally validated with a robotic testbed consisting of six quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles operating in a cluttered environment. }

One way of improving the computational capacity is to decentralize the underlying data processing and distribute the task of the computer center across individual network receivers. In this invited contribution we review the problem of distributed estimation and present an algorithm for distributed least-squares estimation using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Applying the algorithm to a network of GNSS receivers, we show how the distributed data processing of individual receivers can deliver parameter solutions comparable to their centralized network-derived counterparts. With distributed estimation techniques, GNSS single-receiver users can therefore obtain high-precision solutions without the need of having a centralized computing center.}

abstract = "State estimation and synchronization of neural networks (NNs) have recently received ever-increasing research interests due to a large number of successful applications in various fields such as repetitive learning, classification of patterns, nonlinear control, adaptive control, image processing, and so forth. Owing to limited communication bandwidth, the network-induced phenomena and the adopted communication scheduling may cause inevitable negative effects or the degradation of dynamical performance of NNs. This paper, from the perspective of dynamical behavior, renders a comprehensive summary on the recent advances of communication-embedded NNs and their application in nonlinear control. First, some common network-induced phenomena and communication protocols are roughly introduced from both models and mechanisms. Then, the state estimation and synchronization analysis of various NNs with network-induced phenomena are systematically reviewed and some interesting results are separately presented. Furthermore, the latest advances for the cases with communication protocols are profoundly surveyed from three aspects: state estimation, synchronization analysis and applications in control realm. Finally, some challenged problems are listed and several potential future research directions are highlighted."

We consider network topologies modeled by undirected graphs. The basic idea is to provide a local interaction rule among agents so that their state trajectory is a linear combination of sinusoids oscillating only at frequencies function of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. In this way, the problem of decentralized estimation of the eigenvalues is mapped into a standard signal processing problem in which the unknowns are the finite number of frequencies at which the signal oscillates."

The computation occurs through local exchange of information only, namely the information exchange takes place only between agents which are neighbors with respect to a graph representing the system communication architecture. Several performance metrics have been proposed for the evaluation of this algorithm. Particularly interesting and challenging is to relate them to the communication topology. Different performance metrics may yield different answers in comparing alternative communication topologies. In this paper, we present a few performance metrics and we show how these metrics are related to the communication topology. In particular, when available, we present bounds which permit to relate performance and topology for general graphs, for graphs with symmetries, called d-dimensional tori, and for geometric graphs."

The connection-graph-stability score for each edge is defined as the sum of the lengths of the shortest paths making use of that edge. We prove that the algebraic connectivity of the graph is bounded below by the size of the graph divided by the maximum connection-graph-stability score assigned to the edges."

All simple connected graphs with second largest Laplacian eigenvalue at most 3 are characterized. It is also shown that graphs with second largest Laplacian eigenvalue at most 3 are determined by their Laplacian spectrum. Moreover, the graphs with maximum and the second maximum Laplacian separators among all connected graphs are determined."

	abstract = {Spatially and temporally highly resolved depth information enables numerous applications including human machine interaction in gaming or safety functions in the automotive industry. In this paper, we address this issue using time-of-flight (ToF) 3D cameras which are compact devices providing highly resolved depth information. Practical restrictions often require one to reduce the amount of data to be read-out and transmitted. Using standard ToF cameras, this can only be achieved by lowering the spatial or temporal resolution. To overcome such a limitation, we propose a compressive ToF camera design using block-structured sensing matrices that allows one to reduce the amount of data while keeping high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose the use of efficient reconstruction algorithms based on -minimization and TV-regularization. The reconstruction methods are applied to data captured by a real ToF camera system and evaluated in terms of reconstruction quality and computational effort. For both -minimization and TV-regularization, we use a local as well as a global reconstruction strategy. For all considered instances, global TV-regularization turns out to clearly perform best in terms of evaluation metrics including the PSNR.}

	abstract = {We address continuous-time quantum walks on graphs, and discuss whether and how quantum-limited measurements on the walker may extract information on the tunnelling amplitude between the nodes of the graphs. For a few remarkable families of graphs, we evaluate the ultimate quantum bound to precision, i.e. we compute the quantum Fisher information (QFI), and assess the performances of incomplete measurements, i.e. measurements performed on a subset of the graph s nodes. We also optimize the QFI over the initial preparation of the walker and find the optimal measurement achieving the ultimate precision in each case. As the topology of the graph is changed, a non-trivial interplay between the connectivity and the achievable precision is uncovered.}

Channel intermittency captures randomness of network interconnections and packet-drop links. Based on input output properties of feedback systems, we propose novel iterative algorithms that incorporate a networked feedback compensator to mitigate effects of the unreliable communication on distributed averaging. The new algorithms are time-invariant and do not suffer from the random walk behavior to additive noise of other average consensus algorithms. Moreover, the use of the link state information at the receiver leads to a new algorithm, which computes averages approximately correctly in the presence of intermittent communication and additive noise, under certain conditions.},

The proposed control strategy is decentralized, since agents have no global knowledge of the goal to achieve, knowing only the position and velocity of some agents. This control strategy allows a set of mobile agents to track a predetermined trajectory while they achieve a time-varying formation. For the collision avoidance, we add a repulsive vector field of the unstable focus type to the time-varying formation tracking control law. A leader-followers scheme is employed, using formation graphs to represent interactions between agents. The results are presented for the front points of differential-drive mobile robots. The theoretical results are verified by numerical simulation."

By introducing a gradient descent term into the estimator, the explicit knowledge of the bound of the agents? speed is not necessary in contrast to existing works, and each agent is able to compute the centroid of the whole formation in finite time. Then, based on the centroid estimation, a distributed control algorithm is proposed to render the formation tracking and stabilization errors to converge to zero, respectively.

Classically, aggregation has been viewed as an evolutionarily advantageous state, in which members derive the benefits of protection, mate choice, and centralized information, balanced by the costs of limiting resources. Consisting of individual members, aggregations nevertheless function as an integrated whole, displaying a complex set of behaviors not possible at the level of the individual organism. Complexity theory indicates that large populations of units can self-organize into aggregations that generate pattern, store information, and engage in collective decision-making. This begs the question, are all emergent properties of animal aggregations functional or are some simply pattern? Solutions to this dilemma will necessitate a closer marriage of theoretical and modeling studies linked to empirical work addressing the choices, and trajectories, of individuals constrained by membership in the group.},

Here, we model a non-linear system of self-propelled individuals interacting via a pairwise attractive and repulsive potential. Depending on the interaction parameters, the agents may disperse, accumulate into self-organizing structures such as flocks and vortices, or collapse onto themselves. Borrowing tools from Statistical Mechanics, we discuss the connections between the H-stable nature of the interaction potential and resulting aggregating patterns and asymptotic behaviors.",

abstract = "We consider a self-propelled particle system which has been used to describe certain types of collective motion of animals, such as fish schools and bird flocks. Interactions between particles are specified by means of a pairwise potential, repulsive at short ranges and attractive at longer ranges. The exponentially decaying Morse potential is a typical choice, and is known to reproduce certain types of collective motion observed in nature, particularly aligned flocks and rotating mills. We introduce a class of interaction potentials, that we call Quasi-Morse, for which flock and rotating mills states are also observed numerically, however in that case the corresponding macroscopic equations allow for explicit solutions in terms of special functions, with coefficients that can be obtained numerically without solving the particle evolution. We compare the obtained solutions with long-time dynamics of the particle systems and find a close agreement for several types of flock and mill solutions."

Previous work has shown that starlings pay attention to their seven closest neighbors, but until now it was not understood why this number is seven. Our paper explains the mystery: when uncertainty in sensing is present, interacting with six or seven neighbors optimizes the balance between group cohesiveness and individual effort. To prove this result we develop a new systems-theoretic approach for understanding noisy consensus dynamics. The approach allows the evaluation of robustness over a family of hypothesized sensing strategies using observations of the spatial positions of birds within the flock. We apply this approach to experimental data from wild starling flocks, and find that six or seven neighbors yield maximal robustness. The implication that robustness of cohesion may have been a factor in the evolution of flocking has significant consequences for evolutionary biology. In addition, the results and the versatility of the approach have implications for uncertainty management in social and technological networks.},

abstract={We propose a distributed algorithm, named Distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (D-ADMM), for solving separable optimization problems in networks of interconnected nodes or agents. In a separable optimization problem there is a private cost function and a private constraint set at each node. The goal is to minimize the sum of all the cost functions, constraining the solution to be in the intersection of all the constraint sets. D-ADMM is proven to converge when the network is bipartite or when all the functions are strongly convex, although in practice, convergence is observed even when these conditions are not met. We use D-ADMM to solve the following problems from signal processing and control: average consensus, compressed sensing, and support vector machines. Our simulations show that D-ADMM requires less communications than state-of-the-art algorithms to achieve a given accuracy level. Algorithms with low communication requirements are important, for example, in sensor networks, where sensors are typically battery-operated and communicating is the most energy consuming operation.},
