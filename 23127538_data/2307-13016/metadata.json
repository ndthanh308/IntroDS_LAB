  "abstract": "In Linear Hashing ($\\mathsf{LH}$) with $β$ bins on a size $u$ universe ${\\mathcal{U}=\\{0,1,\\ldots, u-1\\}}$, items $\\{x_1,x_2,\\ldots, x_n\\}\\subset \\mathcal{U}$ are placed in bins by the hash function $$x_i\\mapsto (ax_i+b)\\mod p \\mod β$$ for some prime $p\\in [u,2u]$ and randomly chosen integers $a,b \\in [1,p]$. The \"maxload\" of $\\mathsf{LH}$ is the number of items assigned to the fullest bin. Expected maxload for a worst-case set of items is a natural measure of how well $\\mathsf{LH}$ distributes items amongst the bins.\n  Fix $β=n$. Despite $\\mathsf{LH}$'s simplicity, bounding $\\mathsf{LH}$'s worst-case maxload is extremely challenging. It is well-known that on random inputs $\\mathsf{LH}$ achieves maxload $Ω\\left(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}\\right)$; this is currently the best lower bound for $\\mathsf{LH}$'s expected maxload. Recently Knudsen established an upper bound of $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1 / 3})$. The question \"Is the worst-case expected maxload of $\\mathsf{LH}$ $n^{o(1)}$?\" is one of the most basic open problems in discrete math.\n  In this paper we propose a set of intermediate open questions to help researchers make progress on this problem. We establish the relationship between these intermediate open questions and make some partial progress on them.",
