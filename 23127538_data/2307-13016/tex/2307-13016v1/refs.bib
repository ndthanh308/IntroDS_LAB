% tbh I LIKE THE ARXIV version better, less fourier analysis. 
% but FOCS version is more polished

	abstract = {Hashing with linear probing dates back to the 1950s and is among the most widely studied algorithms. In recent years, it has become one of the most important hash table organizations because it uses the cache of modern computers very well. Unfortunately, previous analyses relied either on complicated and space-consuming hash functions, or on the unrealistic assumption of free access to a hash function with random and independent function values. Carter and Wegman, in their seminal paper on universal hashing, have already raised the question of extending their analysis to linear probing. However, we show in this paper that linear probing using a pairwise independent family may have expected logarithmic cost per operation. On the positive side, we show that 5-wise independence is enough to ensure constant expected time per operation. This resolves the question of finding a space- and time-efficient hash function that provably ensures good performance for linear probing.},

In this paper we make some remarks on this conjecture. Firstly, we can improve the trivial lower bound of 1/(2n) slightly for large n, to (1/(2n)) + (c log n)/(n^2 (loglog n)^2) for some absolute constant c&gt;0; previous improvements were roughly of the form (1/(2n)) + c/n^2. Secondly, we show that to verify the conjecture, it suffices to do so under the assumption that the speeds are integers of size n^{O(n^2)}. We also obtain some results in the case when all the velocities are integers of size O(n).}, journal={Contributions to Discrete Mathematics}, publisher={Faculty of Science, University of Calgary}, author={Tao, Terence}, year={2018}, month={Dec}, pages={No 2 (2018)}, language={en} }
