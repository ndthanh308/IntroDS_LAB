  "abstract": "In this paper, we study the existence of solution for stochastic evolution equations with almost sectorial operators and possibly a non dense domain. Such problems cover several types of evolution equations, we are interested here in particular in evolution equations with non-homogenous boundary conditions of white noise type. We obtain the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions in state space using the integrated semigroup theory. The results are applied to stochastic parabolic equations with Neumann boundary conditions.",
