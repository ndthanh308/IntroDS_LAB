Predictive coding has been proposed as a potentially more biologically realistic alternative to backpropagation for training neural networks. This manuscript reviews and extends recent work on the mathematical relationship between predictive coding and backpropagation for training feedforward artificial neural networks on supervised learning tasks. Implications of these results for the interpretation of predictive coding and deep neural networks as models of biological learning are discussed along with a repository of functions, Torch2PC, for performing predictive coding with PyTorch neural network models.},

@article{Bommasani.2022,
 abstract = {AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

@article{Liu.2021,
 abstract = {This paper surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub {\textquotedbl}prompt-based learning{\textquotedbl}. Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x' that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: it allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this paper we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.the choice of pre-trained models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts, but also release other resources, e.g., a website http://pretrain.nlpedia.ai/ including constantly-updated survey, and paperlist.},

Nevertheless, state-of-the-art models have generally struggled with tasks that require quantitative reasoning, such as solving mathematics, science, and engineering problems at the college level.

The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on technical benchmarks without the use of external tools.

@article{Sinha.2023,
 abstract = {Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving for healthcare services. Higher cognitive thinking in AI refers to the ability of the system to perform advanced cognitive processes, such as problem-solving, decision-making, reasoning, and perception. This type of thinking goes beyond simple data processing and involves the ability to understand and manipulate abstract concepts, interpret, and use information in a contextually relevant way, and generate new insights based on past experiences and accumulated knowledge. Natural language processing models like ChatGPT is a conversational program that can interact with humans to provide answers to queries. Objective We aimed to ascertain the capability of ChatGPT in solving higher-order reasoning in the subject of pathology. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted on the internet using an AI-based chat program that provides free service for research purposes. The current version of ChatGPT (January 30 version) was used to converse with a total of 100 higher-order reasoning queries. These questions were randomly selected from the question bank of the institution and categorized according to different systems. The responses to each question were collected and stored for further analysis. The responses were evaluated by three expert pathologists on a zero to five scale and categorized into the structure of the observed learning outcome (SOLO) taxonomy categories. The score was compared by a one-sample median test with hypothetical values to find its accuracy. Result A total of 100 higher-order reasoning questions were solved by the program in an average of 45.31$\pm$7.14 seconds for an answer. The overall median score was 4.08 (Q1-Q3: 4-4.33) which was below the hypothetical maximum value of five (one-test median test p {\textless}0.0001) and similar to four (one-test median test p = 0.14). The majority (86{\%}) of the responses were in the {\textquotedbl}relational{\textquotedbl}~category in the SOLO taxonomy. There was no difference in the scores of the responses for questions asked from various organ systems in the subject of Pathology (Kruskal Wallis p = 0.55). The scores rated by three pathologists had an excellent level of inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.975 [95{\%} CI: 0.965-0.983]; F = 40.26; p {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusion The capability of ChatGPT to solve higher-order reasoning questions in pathology had a relational level of accuracy. Hence, the text output had connections among its parts to provide a meaningful response. The answers from the program can score approximately 80{\%}. Hence, academicians or students can get help from the program for solving reasoning-type questions also. As the program is evolving, further studies are needed to find its accuracy level in any further versions.},

@article{Dodge.2022,
 abstract = {By providing unprecedented access to computational resources, cloud computing has enabled rapid growth in technologies such as machine learning, the computational demands of which incur a high energy cost and a commensurate carbon footprint. As a result, recent scholarship has called for better estimates of the greenhouse gas impact of AI: data scientists today do not have easy or reliable access to measurements of this information, precluding development of actionable tactics. Cloud providers presenting information about software carbon intensity to users is a fundamental stepping stone towards minimizing emissions. In this paper, we provide a framework for measuring software carbon intensity, and propose to measure operational carbon emissions by using location-based and time-specific marginal emissions data per energy unit. We provide measurements of operational software carbon intensity for a set of modern models for natural language processing and computer vision, and a wide range of model sizes, including pretraining of a 6.1 billion parameter language model. We then evaluate a suite of approaches for reducing emissions on the Microsoft Azure cloud compute platform: using cloud instances in different geographic regions, using cloud instances at different times of day, and dynamically pausing cloud instances when the marginal carbon intensity is above a certain threshold. We confirm previous results that the geographic region of the data center plays a significant role in the carbon intensity for a given cloud instance, and find that choosing an appropriate region can have the largest operational emissions reduction impact. We also show that the time of day has notable impact on operational software carbon intensity. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for how machine learning practitioners can use software carbon intensity information to reduce environmental impact.},

Just how human-like are these responses when it comes to dialogues about physics, in particular about the standard content of introductory physics courses? This study explores that question by having ChatGTP, the pre-eminent language model in 2023, work through representative assessment content of an actual calculus-based physics course and grading the responses in the same way human responses would be graded.

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

@article{Brown.2020,
 abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

This attention is a timely response to the many urgent questions that this technology raises, but it can sometimes miss important considerations. This paper surveys the evidence for eight potentially surprising such points:  1. LLMs predictably get more capable with increasing investment, even without targeted innovation.  2. Many important LLM behaviors emerge unpredictably as a byproduct of increasing investment.  3. LLMs often appear to learn and use representations of the outside world.  4. There are no reliable techniques for steering the behavior of LLMs.  5. Experts are not yet able to interpret the inner workings of LLMs.  6. Human performance on a task isn't an upper bound on LLM performance.  7. LLMs need not express the values of their creators nor the values encoded in web text.  8. Brief interactions with LLMs are often misleading.},
