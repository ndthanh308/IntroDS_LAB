abstract = {This article introduces and analyzes multilevel Monte Carlo schemes for the evaluation of the expectation E[f(Y)], where Y=(Yt)t∈[0,1] is a solution of a stochastic differential equation driven by a Lévy process. Upper bounds are provided for the worst case error over the class of all path dependent measurable functions f, which are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the supremum norm. In the case where the Blumenthal–Getoor index of the driving process is smaller than one, one obtains convergence rates of order 1/n, when the computational cost n tends to infinity. This rate is optimal up to logarithms in the case where Y is itself a Lévy process. Furthermore, an error estimate for Blumenthal–Getoor indices larger than one is included together with results of numerical experiments.}

Since under imposed assumptions drift is only measurable with respect to the time variable, the classical Euler algorithm does not converge in general to the solution of such equation. We give a construction of the randomized Euler scheme and prove that it has the error O(n−min{ϱ,1/2}), where n is the number of discretization points. We also investigate the optimality of the defined algorithm.}

abstract={We address the approximation of functionals depending on a system of particles, described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs), in the mean-field limit when the number of particles approaches infinity. This problem is equivalent to estimating the weak solution of the limiting McKean--Vlasov SDE. To that end, our approach uses systems with finite numbers of particles and a time-stepping scheme. In this case, there are two discretization parameters: the number of time steps and the number of particles. Based on these two parameters, we consider different variants of the Monte Carlo and Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods and show that, in the best case, the optimal work complexity of MLMC, to estimate the functional in one typical setting with an error tolerance of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}TOL{\}}{\$}{\$}, is when using the partitioning estimator and the Milstein time-stepping scheme. We also consider a method that uses the recent Multi-index Monte Carlo method and show an improved work complexity in the same typical setting of . Our numerical experiments are carried out on the so-called Kuramoto model, a system of coupled oscillators.},
