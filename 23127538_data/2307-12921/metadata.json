  "abstract": "We introduce an algebra of elliptic commuting variables involving a base $q$, nome $p$, and $2r$ noncommuting variables. This algebra, which for $r=1$ reduces to an algebra considered earlier by the author, is an elliptic extension of the well-known algebra of $r$ $q$-commuting variables. We present a multinomial theorem valid as an identity in this algebra, hereby extending the author's previously obtained elliptic binomial theorem to higher rank. Two essential ingredients are a consistency relation satisfied by the elliptic weights and the Weierstrass type $\\mathsf A$ elliptic partial fraction decomposition. From the elliptic multinomial theorem we obtain, by convolution, an identity equivalent to Rosengren's type $\\mathsf A$ extension of the Frenkel-Turaev ${}_{10}V_9$ summation. Interpreted in terms of a weighted counting of lattice paths in the integer lattice $\\mathbb Z^r$, this derivation of Rosengren's $\\mathsf A_r$ Frenkel-Turaev summation constitutes the first combinatorial proof of that fundamental identity.",
