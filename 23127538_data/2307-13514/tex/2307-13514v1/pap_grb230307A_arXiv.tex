%% For manuscript that include authors in collaborations, AASTeX v6.31
%% builds on the \collaboration command to allow greater freedom to

%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors 
%% on the front page.
%%
%% For manuscript without any need to use \collaboration the

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.31 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affiliations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% auto-indexing of affiliations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% argument which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid. If the "orcid-ID.png" image file is 
%% present or in the LaTeX pathway, the OrcID icon will appear next to
%% the authors name.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.31 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.31 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

\grb\  is the second  brightest gamma ray burst detected in more than 50 years of observations and is located in the direction of the Magellanic Bridge. 
Despite its long duration,  it is most likely the result of the compact merger of a binary ejected from a galaxy in the local universe (redshift $z=0.065$).   
Our \xmm\   observation of its afterglow at 4.5 days shows a power-law spectrum with photon index $\Gamma =1.73 \pm0.10$, unabsorbed flux $F_{0.3-10\,\rm keV}=(8.8\pm0.5)\times 10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ and no absorption in excess of that produced in our Galaxy and in the Magellanic Bridge. We derive a limit of $N_{\rm H}^{\rm HOST} < 5\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ on the absorption at the GRB redshift, which is a factor $\sim\,$5 below the value measured during the prompt phase. 
We searched for the presence of dust scattering rings with negative results and set an upper limit of the order of $A_V<0.05$ on the absorption from dust in the Magellanic Bridge.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Not many years after their discovery it was recognized that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)  can be divided into two  groups, based mostly on their duration and, to a lesser extent, spectral hardness \citep{1993ApJ...413L.101K}. It was later realized that this phenomenological distinction is related to different formation mechanisms: GRBs of the ``short'' class  result from the merging of two compact objects \citep{Abbott2017} while those of the ``long'' class  are produced in core collapse events of massive stars \citep{Hjorth2012}.
However, several results obtained in the last few years indicate that a classification based only on duration does not always reflect the intrinsic properties related to the GRB origin. For example, follow up observations of the short duration GRB 200826A \citep{Ahumada2021,Rossi2022} provided evidences of supernova emission associated to this burst, as usually detected in nearby collapsar-like events. On the other hand, kilonova signatures calling for a compact object merger origin have been associated with bursts of long duration, such as GRB 060614 \citep{Yang2015}  and, more recently, GRB 211221A \citep{Rastinejad2022,Troja2022,Yang2022}. A classification in terms of Type I/II, respectively for mergers and collapsars, seems thus more convenient \citep{2006Natur.444.1010Z}.

A recent example of a GRB with long duration, but most likely originating from a compact binary merger is provided by \grb\ \citep{2023arXiv230702098L,2023arXiv230702996D,2023arXiv230705689S}. 
This long GRB ($\sim$150 s) immediately attracted much interest owing to its very large fluence of a few $10^{-3}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
\citep{2023GCN.33407....1D,2023GCN.33411....1D}, surpassed only by that of the exceptional GRB 221009A\footnote{Although the occurrence within six months of the two brightest GRBs ever observed 
seems at first remarkable, the time distribution of the complete sample of 17 GRBs with fluence above $10^{-3}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ detected since  1971 (Table 2 of \citealt{2023ApJ...946L..31B}) is fully consistent  with a constant rate.}  \citep{2023GCN.33406....1X,2023GCN.33414....1B,2023GCN.33427....1S}. 



The evidence for a Type I classification for \grb\  comes from  the James Webb Space Telescope discovery of an associated  kilonova \citep{2023arXiv230702098L}, similar to that seen for the gravitational wave merger GW~170817 \citep{Abbott2017}. 
Most likely, the binary merger was ejected from a galaxy seen at an angular offset of 30$''$ from \grb . Given the galaxy's redshift of $z=0.065$, this corresponds to a large, but still plausible, projected distance of about  40 kpc.
The alternative association of \grb\ with a host galaxy  at redshift $z=3.87$ \citep{2023GCN.33580....1L}, 
is considered very unlikely since it would imply an unprecedented isotropic energy as large as  $10^{56}$ erg.


\grb\ is also interesting because it occurred in the direction of the Magellanic Bridge, a structure  consisting mainly of HI which connects the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds and was probably produced by the tidal interaction between these two galaxies  \citep[see, e.g.,][and references therein]{2021A&A...649A...7G}. The occurrence of a bright GRB in this direction offers the possibility to constrain the poorly known properties of the interstellar dust in the Bridge  through the analysis of X-ray scattered radiation, as done  for Galactic dust clouds with other GRBs     \citep{vaughan04,2006A&A...449..203T,2006ApJ...639..323V,2007A&A...473..423V,2017MNRAS.472.1465P,2023ApJ...946L..30T}.

Here we report the results of an \xmm\   observation  of \grb\ carried out about 5 days after the burst occurrence (Section~\ref{sec:xmm}), complemented by data of the prompt emission in the hard X-ray range obtained with the INTEGRAL satellite (Section~\ref{sec:integral}).  In Section~\ref{sec:dust} we use the  X-ray data to look for the presence of dust scattering rings and to derive constraints on the amount of dust in the Magellanic Bridge.



\section{Data analysis and results} 

\subsection{Prompt gamma-ray emission with INTEGRAL} \label{sec:integral}

\grb\ was detected by the Anti-Coincidence Shield (ACS) of the SPI instrument on board the INTEGRAL satellite.  
The ACS, besides serving as an active shield for the germanium  detectors of SPI, acts as a nearly omni-directional detector with high sensitivity at energies above $\sim\,$75 keV \citep{2003A&A...411L.299V}. It provides data with fixed time resolution of 50 ms in a single energy channel and without directional information. The burst occurred at an angle of 75$^{\circ}$ with respect to the INTEGRAL pointing direction, and at an azimuthal angle for which the ACS is not obstructed by other instruments on board the satellite. Therefore, the ACS provided an optimal response for the direction of \grb\  \citep[see, e.g.,][]{2017A&A...603A..46S}.

The ACS light curve of \grb\ is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:spiacs}. The burst showed remarkable variability on short time scales, within an envelope with a fast-rise  and a slower decay. The $T_{90}$  duration is of 28.6 s, but significant emission is visible up to 130 s after   $T_0=$ 15:44:07 UT.  
The burst starts with a $\sim\,$0.2 s long precursor, which contains $\sim\,$0.4\% of the total fluence. This is followed by a multipeaked pulse lasting about 17 s, until a dip at $\sim T_0+18$ s.
The temporal decay after $T_0+20$ s can be approximated by a power law with index $\alpha=-3.467\pm0.007$.
The total fluence, from $T_0$ to $T_0+130$ s, is $(1.5239\pm0.0008)\times10^7$ ACS counts, which, adopting the average conversion factor of 1 ACS count $\sim10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ \citep{2009essu.confE..49V}, corresponds to $\sim1.52\times10^{-3}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ in the 75--1000 keV  range. 


 
\subsection{X-ray afterglow with \xmm}
\label{sec:xmm}

A 50 ks long Target of Opportunity observation of \grb\ was carried out with the \xmm\ satellite, starting on 2023 March 12 at 02:16:54 UT, about 4.5 days after the GRB trigger. 
The EPIC-pn \citep{struder01} and the two EPIC-MOS \citep{turner01} cameras were operated in Full window mode, with the thin optical-blocking filter. 
After processing the data with the  \texttt{SAS 19.1.3} \citep{gabriel04} and the most recent calibration files, we selected the EPIC events with standard filtering expressions  and  removing time intervals of high background. This resulted in net exposure times of 37.2 ks (pn) and 41.5 ks (MOS). In addition to the GRB afterglow, several sources were detected (see Appendix~\ref{images}).

The  afterglow spectra were extracted from a circular region of 30$''$ radius, centered at coordinates R.A.$=04^{\rm h} 03^{\rm m} 26^{\rm s}\!\!.24$, Dec.$=-75^\circ 22' 43''\!\!\!.\,8$, while those of the background from a nearby circle of 40$''$ radius. The spectra  of the three cameras were  rebinned with a minimum of 30 counts per bin and then fitted simultaneously  using the \textsc{xspec} software (version 12.13.0c). For the  absorption model we used cross sections and abundances from \citet{2000ApJ...542..914W}.  Errors on the spectral parameters are given at 1$\sigma$ confidence level. 

The spectra are well described ($\chi^2/dof = 29.14/49$, null hypothesis probability (nhp) = 0.99) by an absorbed power law with photon index $\Gamma = 1.73 \pm 0.10$, column density $N_{\rm H} = (9 \pm 2)\times 10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$, and unabsorbed flux   $F_{0.3-10\,\rm keV}=(8.8\pm0.5)\times 10^{-14}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:spec}).

The derived absorption is consistent with the local (Galactic plus Magellanic Clouds) column density in this direction,  $N_{\rm H}^{\rm LOC}=9.4\times10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$  \citep{2016A&A...594A.116H}.
Therefore, in order  to constrain   possible  absorption in the GRB host,  we fixed the column density to $N_{\rm H}^{\rm LOC}$ and added to the model a redshifted absorption component ($N_{\rm H}^{\rm HOST}$).
We found that, at the GRB redshift  $z=0.065$, the host absorption is $N_{\rm H}^{\rm HOST}<5\times10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$ 
($2\sigma$ upper limit).

\subsection{Limits on dust in the Magellanic Bridge}
\label{sec:dust}

We searched for the presence of dust scattered events using the method based on ``pseudo-distances''  \citep{2006A&A...449..203T}, which provides a higher sensitivity for expanding rings compared to a simple analysis of time-integrated images.
Briefly, this method exploits the fact that for a source at distance much greater than that of the dust, X-ray photons detected at an angle $\Theta$ from the source direction arrive with a time delay $t=(D/2c)\Theta^2$,   where $D$ is the distance of the dust. A pseudo-distance $D_i$ can be computed  for each detected count,  based on its coordinates ($x_i$, $y_i$) and arrival time $t_i$:

\begin{equation}
D_i =\frac{ 2c\, (t_i-t_B)}{(x_i-x_B)^2+(y_i-y_B)^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $x_B$, $y_B$ and $t_B$ are the coordinates and time of the GRB. An expanding X-ray ring produced by dust at distance $D$ appears as a Lorentzian peak in the $D_i$ distribution.% \citep{}. 



To derive the $D_i$ distribution we selected the \xmm/EPIC events with energy in the range 0.5--4 keV, \textsc{flag}$\,=\,$0, \textsc{pattern}$\,\leq\,$4 (pn) and $\leq\,$12 (MOS), and we removed several point sources (see Appendix~\ref{images}) by excluding circular regions of
radius $\sim$\,20$''$. The resulting empty regions, as well as the dead areas between CCD gaps, were filled with uniformly-distributed events, in order to avoid artifacts and spurious peaks  in the $D_i$ distribution. 

As it can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:pseudoD}, the distribution of the $D_i$ values does not show any prominent peak  in the range of relevant distances\footnote{Most of the Galactic dust in this direction is concentrated in two layers at distances of 225 pc and 375 pc \citep{lallement22}, but, at the time of our   observation, possible scattering rings produced by these layers had already expanded to angular radii  of $\sim19'$ and   $\sim14.5'$, outside the EPIC field of view.   On the other hand, X-ray scattered by dust in the Magellanic Bridge can be detected because radii in the range $\sim 1-2'$ are expected in this case.}. In fact it is well fit by a single power law with slope $-1.98\pm0.02$  ($\chi^2$/dof $=1.05$,   nhp = 0.35), as expected for uniformly distributed background counts and unscattered X-ray photons. 

 

% Figure environment removed

To derive upper limits on the scattered X-ray flux we carried out  Monte Carlo simulations in which we added to the observed $D_i$ histogram $N_s$ photons distributed according to Lorentzian profiles expected for different distances  of the dust.
In principle, the Lorentzian width $\Gamma$ depends on the thickness $\delta D$ of the dust layer, but, in the case at hand, it is dominated by the finite angular resolution of the instrument ($\delta \Theta_{\rm FWHM} \sim 5''$), which results in $\Gamma = 2 D\, | \delta \Theta_{\rm FWHM}/\Theta |$. At the mean time of the observation (4.7 d after the burst) this gives  the value $\Gamma \sim 0.017  D_{\rm kpc}^{3/2}$ kpc, which we  used in our simulations. 
These were carried out for two representative values, 50 and 70 kpc, which bracket possible distances for dust structures in the Magellanic Bridge \citep[see, e.g.][]{2016AcA....66..149J}.
We found 95\% confidence level upper limits of
$N_s = 245$ EPIC counts for $D=50$ kpc ($\Gamma=6$ kpc) and  $N_s = 260$ EPIC counts for $D=70$ kpc ($\Gamma=10$ kpc).
 


\section{Discussion}

The X-ray flux (0.3--10 keV)  of our \xmm\ observation is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:afterglow}, together with  those from other available measurements of the X-ray afterglow. These are the \swi/XRT observations carried out at $T_0+1.3$~d \citep{2023GCN.33465....1B}\footnote{See also https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt\_products/TILED\_GRB00110/ Source2/curve and https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt\_curves/00021537/}   and $T_0+4.7$~d, and the \cha\ observation at $T_0+25.3$~d \citep{2023GCN.33558....1R}. 
We also show in Figure~\ref{fig:afterglow} the  X-ray light curve of the prompt emission   measured with LEIA in the 0.5--4 keV \citep{2023arXiv230705689S}, opportunely rescaled in the  0.3--10 keV range according to their spectrum (see below).
The temporal evolution  of the afterglow is well fitted by a power law of index $\alpha=-1.05\pm0.13$ and normalization $n = (4.4\pm0.9)\times10^{-13}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ at $T_0+1$ d.

The  upper limit we derived at $T_0+4.5$ d on the host absorption, $N_{\rm H}^{\rm HOST}<5\times10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$, is significantly smaller than the value observed during the prompt emission phase, $N_{\rm H}^{\rm PROMPT}=2.73\times10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$ \citep{2023arXiv230705689S}. This indicates that the material responsible for the prompt absorption has been significantly photoionized or that the afterglow is produced at a large distance from the central engine, not affected by intervening local material.
Evidence of X-ray column density variation has been reported so far only for a handful of GRBs \citep{Starling2005,Campana2007,Campana2021,Grupe2007}. Indeed, a systematic analysis of 199 GRBs observed with XRT  showed that only seven bursts display signs of a decrease in the intrinsic $N_{\rm H}$ \citep{Valan2023}, although the observed variation could also be explained in terms of spectral evolution of the afterglow emission. On the other hand, variations in the X-ray absorption are  predicted due to the ionization of the local medium by the GRB radiation \citep{Perna1998,Lazzati2002,Perna2002}. 
The stringent upper limit derived in  our \xmm\ observation, compared to the  significant absorption  seen in the LEIA data, suggests that such a process is at work in \grb .


We searched for X-ray scattering rings caused by dust in the Magellanic Bridge, with negative results.  Assuming a model for the scattering cross section and knowing the X-ray fluence and spectrum of \grb , the upper limits on the number of scattered photons derived in Section \ref{sec:dust} can be translated into limits on the amount of dust. 
We adopt the analytical dust model of \citet{draine03} and the results obtained with the LEIA experiment \citep{2023arXiv230705689S} on the X-ray prompt emission (a power-law spectrum with photon index $\Gamma=1.67$, 
$N_{\rm H}^{\rm LOC}=9.41\times10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$,  $N_{\rm H}^{\rm HOST}=2.73\times10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$ and fluence $F_{\rm 0.5-4\,keV}$ = $2.27\times10^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$).  
The resulting limits of $A_V<0.040-0.056$, for dust at distances in the 50--70 kpc range,  show the potentiality of this method to constrain the dust properties in the Magellanic Bridge. 
However, we note that the results depend on the chosen dust model. As an example, adopting the  BARE-GR-B model of \citet{zubko04},  which provided the best fit in other observations of dust scattering X-ray halos/rings (e.g., \citealt{rsmith06,tiengo10,2023ApJ...946L..30T}), we can limit the quantity of dust in this part of the Magellanic Bridge to $A_V<0.25-0.32$.
Even so, these limits are more constraining than the total reddening $E(B-V)=0.08\pm0.08$ reported in the \citet{2022MNRAS.511.1317C} map, which in this direction has a spatial resolution of 55$^{\prime}$ and estimates the same reddening value also for foreground Galactic stars.


\section{Conclusions}

We have observed  \grb\ with \xmm\  in order to study its X-ray afterglow about five days after the burst and to search for dust scattering features, exploiting its very high brightness and fortuitous location close to the Large Magellanic Cloud. 

The good counting statistics and wide energy range of the EPIC spectra allowed us to reveal a significant decrease in the host absorption, which passed from $2.73\times10^{21}$~cm$^{-2}$  during the prompt emission phase to less than $5\times10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$,  supporting models of photo ionization of the local medium by the GRB radiation \citep{Perna1998,Lazzati2002,Perna2002}. 

  
The study of dust scattered X-rays from GRBs with sensitive telescopes offers great potentialities.  As it is schematically shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2grb}, in at least two cases, GRB 031203A \citep{2006ApJ...636..967W,2006A&A...449..203T} and \boat\ \citep{2023ApJ...946L..30T},   these analysis provided evidence for a bright soft X-ray excess that could not be observed directly.
Conversely, the prompt soft X-ray emission of \grb\ was directly observed and we could  exploit the resulting information to set limits on the amount of dust in the  Magellanic Bridge. 
Although the limits are not very deep in this particular case, our results indicate that more constraining observations are within reach of the current instrumentation. For example, an earlier  \xmm\ observation of \grb ,  performed when the X-rays potentially scattered by nearby dust clouds were still within the telescope field of view, would have allowed to disentangle the effects of dust in our Galaxy and in the  Magellanic Bridge.

\section{X-ray sources in the \grb\ field}
\label{images}

We reduced and filtered  the EPIC data using standard procedures as described in Section \ref{sec:xmm} and  created pn+MOS images in three energy bands: 0.5--2 keV, 2--12 keV,  and 0.5--12 keV. These images were used to perform  source detection using the SAS tool \emph{edetect\_chain}. The resulting list of   sources was inspected visually to remove possible spurious detections and cross-correlated with optical, infrared and radio catalogs to search for possible identifications. 

The properties of the more interesting sources (i.e. the brightest ones and those with a plausible identification) are reported in Table \ref{tab:data}.
The   EPIC/pn count rates 
and fluxes, derived assuming a power-law model with  photon index $\Gamma=1.7$ and a column density   $N_{\rm H}^{\rm LOC}=9.4\times10^{20}$~cm$^{-2}$  \citep{2016A&A...594A.116H}, refer to the 0.5--2 keV  range. The X-ray to optical flux ratio has been computed as

\begin{equation}
    \log (f_X/f_{\rm opt})= \log f_X+\frac{m}{2.5}+5.37,
\end{equation}

\noindent 
where  $f_X$ is the flux in the 0.5--12 keV range and  $m$ is magnitude in the  red band. When no optical counterpart was present in the error region, a limiting magnitude $m=21$ was assumed. 

Eight sources are identified with foreground stars on the basis of their $f_X/f_{\rm opt}$ and positional coincidence with objects of the GAIA and USNO-B1.0 catalogs. Several sources have been classified as quasars based on  cross-correlation with QSO candidates catalogs  \citep{2018A&A...618A.144G,2019RAA....19...29L}.
