  "abstract": "This study delves into the validity of quantum mechanical operators in the context of quantum gravity, recognizing the potential need for their generalization. A primary objective is to investigate the repercussions of these generalizations on the inherent non-locality within quantum mechanics, as exemplified by Bell's inequality. Additionally, the study scrutinizes the consequences of introducing a non-zero minimal length into the established framework of Bell's inequality. The findings contribute significantly to our theoretical comprehension of the intricate interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity. Moreover, this research explores the impact of quantum gravity on Bell's inequality and its practical applications within quantum technologies, notably in the realms of device-independent protocols, quantum key distribution, and quantum randomness generation.",
