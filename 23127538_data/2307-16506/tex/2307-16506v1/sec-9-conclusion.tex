We have presented a full description of PELICAN: a network that respects particle permutation and Lorentz symmetries important in particle physics. PELICAN is a general network which is performant at 4-vector regression and provides state-of-the-art performance in the task of top-tagging. To demonstrate PELICAN's regression capabilities, we chose the reconstruction of the $W$-boson's 4-momentum from a full top quark jet, and to our knowledge PELICAN is the first ML method applied to this problem. Even within these tasks there is room to improve PELICAN's performance by introducing additional scalar information such as particle charges, which would allow the network to account for the simulated collider's magnetic field. PELICAN's architecture, its flexibility, and generalizability may also allow for future applications to charged-particle track reconstruction, pile-up identification, and full-event reconstruction. Being a general architecture, PELICAN is not limited to top quark decays or even jets. This network inherently provides powerful tools for investigating its own behavior due to the equivariant architecture and shows promise as a tool which can be thoroughly investigated if deployed in real world scenarios.
