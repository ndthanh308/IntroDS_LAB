We describe the machinery for generalizing permutation equivariance to arbitrary $k$-ary interactions between entities for any value of $k$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of higher order permutation equivariant models on several real world applications and find that our results compare favorably to existing permutation invariant/equivariant baselines. }

abstract = {{Recent work on the representation of functions on sets has considered the use of summation in a latent space to enforce permutation invariance. In particular, it has been conjectured that the dimension of this latent space may remain fixed as the cardinality of the sets under consideration increases. However, we demonstrate that the analysis leading to this conjecture requires mappings which are highly discontinuous and argue that this is only of limited practical use. Motivated by this observation, we prove that an implementation of this model via continuous mappings (as provided by e.g. neural networks or Gaussian processes) actually imposes a constraint on the dimensionality of the latent space. Practical universal function representation for set inputs can only be achieved with a latent dimension at least the size of the maximum number of input elements.}},

G-convolutions increase the expressive capacity of the network without increasing the number of parameters. Group convolution layers are easy to use and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead for discrete groups generated by translations, reflections and rotations.

Equivariant networks have shown excellent performance and data efficiency on vision and medical imaging problems that exhibit symmetries. Here we show how this principle can be extended beyond global symmetries to local gauge transformations. This enables the development of a very general class of convolutional neural networks on manifolds that depend only on the intrinsic geometry, and which includes many popular methods from equivariant and geometric deep learning. We implement gauge equivariant CNNs for signals defined on the surface of the icosahedron, which provides a reasonable approximation of the sphere. By choosing to work with this very regular manifold, we are able to implement the gauge equivariant convolution using a single conv2d call, making it a highly scalable and practical alternative to Spherical CNNs. Using this method, we demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods on the task of segmenting omnidirectional images and global climate patterns.},

Inspired by the notion of point clouds, we propose a new approach that considers a jet as an unordered set of its constituent particles, effectively a “particle cloud.” Such a particle cloud representation of jets is efficient in incorporating raw information of jets and also explicitly respects the permutation symmetry. Based on the particle cloud representation, we propose ParticleNet, a customized neural network architecture using Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network for jet tagging problems. The ParticleNet architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two representative jet tagging benchmarks and is improved significantly over existing methods.},
