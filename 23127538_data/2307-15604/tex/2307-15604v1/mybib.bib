abstract = {This article investigates the problem of acquiring 3D object maps of indoor household environments, in particular kitchens. The objects modeled in these maps include cupboards, tables, drawers and shelves, which are of particular importance for a household robotic assistant. Our mapping approach is based on PCD (point cloud data) representations. Sophisticated interpretation methods operating on these representations eliminate noise and resample the data without deleting the important details, and interpret the improved point clouds in terms of rectangular planes and 3D geometric shapes. We detail the steps of our mapping approach and explain the key techniques that make it work. The novel techniques include statistical analysis, persistent histogram features estimation that allows for a consistent registration, resampling with additional robust fitting techniques, and segmentation of the environment into meaningful regions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Mikkelstrup2022,
abstract = {High-frequency mechanical impact (HFMI) treatment is a well-documented post-weld treatment to improve the fatigue life of welds. Treatment of the weld toe must be performed by a skilled operator due to the curved and inconsistent nature of the weld toe to ensure an acceptable quality. However, the process is characterised by noise and vibrations; hence, manual treatment should be avoided for extended periods of time. This work proposes an automated system for applying robotised 3D scanning to perform post-weld treatment and quality inspection of linear welds. A 3D scan of the weld is applied to locally determine the gradient and curvature across the weld surface to locate the weld toe. Based on the weld toe position, an adaptive robotic treatment trajectory is generated that accurately follows the curvature of the weld toe and adapts tool orientation to the weld profile. The 3D scan is reiterated after the treatment, and the surface gradient and curvature are further applied to extract the quantitative measures of the treatment, such as weld toe radius, indentation depth, and groove deviation and width. The adaptive robotic treatment is compared experimentally to manual and linear robotic treatment. This is done by treating 600-mm weld toe of each treatment type and evaluating the quantitative measures using the developed system. The results showed that the developed system reduced the overall treatment variance by respectively 26.6% and 31.9%. Additionally, a mean weld toe deviation of 0.09 mm was achieved; thus, improving process stability yet minimising human involvement.},

@article{Larsen2021,
abstract = {Several methods for finite element modelling and analysis of tubular welded joints are described in various design codes. These codes provide specific recommendations for modelling of the welded joints, using simple weld geometries. In this paper, experimental strain range results from two full-scale semi-automatically welded K-nodes tests are compared to corresponding finite element models. Three dimensional (3D) scans of the weld surfaces have been developed for the automatically welded K-joints. These 3D scans are included in the finite element (FE) models to determine the accuracy of the FE models. Some discrepancies are observed between finite element predictions and test results. Finite element model updating has been applied to improve the accuracy of the developed finite element models. The results are compared to a FE model with a simple weld geometry based on common offshore design codes and a FE model without any modelled weld. The results show that the FE model with 3D scanned welds are more accurate than the other FE models. The precise location of weld toe in the 3D scanned weld is difficult to locate in the FE model, thus stochastic finite element modelling is performed to analyse the probabilistic hot-spot stresses. The results show large variations in the hot-spot stresses. It can be concluded that it is necessary to evaluate the probabilistic nature of stresses for calculating fatigue lives of welded tubular joints in offshore structures.},

@article{Spath2023,
abstract = {To predict the service life of welded joints, the seam welds of samples (cross joint, K-seam, sheet thickness 15 mm and a laser-welded butt joint, sheet thickness 6 mm, both made of steel quality S 355) are recorded using a 3D scanner. The data obtained in this way is processed and transferred to a finite element method program. The meshing of the weld seams is very detailed. A finite-element-method stress calculation is then carried out. The real samples are tested in a fatigue test up to the point of cracking. The results from calculation and test are then compared. A possible crack location can be predicted very well using the finite element method results. The cracks in the real test are always in the area of very high or often the absolute highest calculated stresses. A prediction of the service life in the fatigue test is possible with a certain scatter – close to the usual scatter for welded joints. Based on the results of 19 samples, a fatigue class for local stress (based on the real geometry) of FAT 300 can be preliminary estimated for the cross-joint specimens. Definition according to the specifications of the International Institute of Welding (FAT at 2 mio. cycles, survival probability 97.7 %).},
