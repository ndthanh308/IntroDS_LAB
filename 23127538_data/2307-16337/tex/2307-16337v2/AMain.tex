\begin{abstract}
We prove that if $R$ is a G-ring then every fully dualizable $R$-linear cocomplete category is equivalent to a twist by a $\GG_m$-gerbe of the category of modules over a finite \'etale $R$-algebra.  We also show that this holds more generally over an arbitrary commutative ring under an additional compact generation hypothesis. We  include variants of these results that apply to $R$-linear graded categories, and to the context of $\infty$-categories linear over connective commutative ring spectra.
