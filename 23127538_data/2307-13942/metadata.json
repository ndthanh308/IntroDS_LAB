  "abstract": "We first establish local $C^2$ estimates of solutions to the $σ_2$-curvature equation with nonlinear Neumann boundary condition. Then, under assumption that the background metric has nonnegative mean curvature on totally non-umbilic boundary, for dimensions three and four we prove the existence of a conformal metric with a prescribed positive $σ_2$-curvature and a prescribed nonnegative boundary mean curvature. The local estimates play an important role in the blow up analysis in the latter existence result.",
