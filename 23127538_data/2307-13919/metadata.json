  "abstract": "Comparative Analysis on temporal and spatial behaviors of droplets produced in a converging co-flow has been investigated when interchanging of phases, NaAlg (non-Newtonian) and soybean oil (Newtonian). The Carreau model is promoted and gave rarely reported negative non-Newtonian index, $n<0$, by which phase diagrams of \"butterfly distribution\" on temporal $f \\cdot τ\\sim\\left(Q_d / Q_c\\right)^n$ space and \"grape distribution\" on spatial $d^* / D_c \\sim\\left(Q_d / Q_c\\right)^n$ space are distinguished for the first time. These flow charts shows symmetry on refined expression $\\left(Q_d / Q_c\\right)^n=1$, (either $Q_d / Q_c=1$ or $n=0$) for both comparative experiments. We also find an interesting synchronous transition phenomenon exist, where the interchanging of disperse and continuous phases will not affect their temporal and spatial characteristics of drop generating, which is dynamically rarely happened.",
