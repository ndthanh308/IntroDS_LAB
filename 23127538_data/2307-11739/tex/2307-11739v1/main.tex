\begin{abstract}

The cluster state acquired by evolving the nearest-neighbor (NN) Ising model from a completely separable state is the resource for measurement-based quantum computation.  Instead of an NN system, a variable-range power law interacting Ising model  can generate  a  genuine multipartite entangled (GME) weighted graph state (WGS)  that may reveal intrinsic characteristics of the evolving Hamiltonian. We establish that the pattern of generalized geometric measure (GGM) in the evolved state with an arbitrary number of qubits is sensitive to fall-off rates and the range of interactions of the evolving Hamiltonian.  We report that the time-derivative and time-averaged GGM at a particular time can  detect  the transition points present in the fall-off rates  of the interaction strength,  separating different regions, namely long-range, quasi-local and local ones in one- and two-dimensional lattices with deformation. Moreover, we illustrate that in the quasi-local and local regimes, there exists a minimum coordination number in the evolving Ising model for a fixed total number of qubits which can mimic the GGM of the long-range model. In order to achieve a finite-size subsystem from the entire system, we design a local  measurement strategy that allows a WGS of an arbitrary number of qubits  to be  reduced to a local unitarily equivalent WGS having fewer qubits with modified weights.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

 The computational time of certain mathematical problems like prime factorization of integers \cite{factor} can be reduced utilizing the  quantum mechanical principles compared to  classically available algorithms -- an important milestone that establishes the significance of building quantum computers \cite{nielsen_chuang_2010}. Since then, quantum speedups that cannot be achieved by the best classical computer have been demonstrated in distinguishing classes of functions \cite{deutsch1992,Bernstein1997} in a search problem from database \cite{grover1997} in estimating phases of an operator \cite{phase95,kitaev02} and for solving linear systems of equations \cite{hhl09} to name a few. Although entanglement \cite{horo_ent_09} has been shown to be beneficial for accomplishing higher efficiency in certain quantum protocols, including various computational tasks \cite{linden01,jozsa03,nest13} and quantum communication \cite{cryp_1991,bennet1992,cryp_1992,tele_1993,dc1996,cryp_2000,cryp_2002,BENNETT20147,Ren2017,guo2019}, the resource required to attain quantum supremacy in quantum algorithms has yet to be determined \cite{ahnefeld22,naseri22}.

%Solving computational tasks in the domain of computer science by utilising the rules of quantum mechanics, often known as quantum computation, is one of the rapidly emerging research areas in the second revolution of quantum technologies. It is not clear if entanglement is required in quantum computation, which attempts to outperform classical computers by utilising quantum algorithms in the areas including quantum secret sharing \cite{Ekert1991, Zeilinger2000, Gisin2002, Hillery1999, cleve1999share, Karlsson1999, Hillery2011, HILLERY2006}, search \cite{giri17} and optimisation \cite{zhou20}, simulation of quantum systems [] and solving large systems of linear equations \cite{harrow09}, despite the fact that it has been demonstrated to give quantum benefits in a variety of tasks \cite{guerreschi19}. 

On the other hand, entanglement is one of the prerequisites for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) \cite{Rauss2001, Hein2004,hein2006entanglement,casati2006quantum,browne2006oneway,briegel2009measurement}  which allows one to construct all  the universal quantum gates required in a quantum computer \cite{divincenzo95}. In the paradigm of MBQC or \textit{one-way quantum computation} \cite{Rauss2001,browne2006oneway}, generation of genuine multipartite entangled (GME) states and more specifically, multipartite cluster states \cite{briegel01, Yokoyama2013} remain crucial.
These states are  specific types of stabilizer states, known also as graph states, which are employed as a universal resource for  measurement-based circuits followed by Clifford operations and they are easy to simulate through classical computer \cite{ scott_2004_pra, simon_2006_pra,nielsen_chuang_2010}. The corresponding states have been successfully generated on several physical platforms  and are used to show a variety of information processing tasks \cite{zhang06,Prevedel2007,tame07,lanyon13,Bell_2013,Yokoyama2013,bell_14,bell2_14}. 
Beyond one-way models, numerous kinds of universal resource states, such as two-dimensional ($2$D) cluster \cite{briegel01,Brell_2015}, Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT)-type \cite{aklt88}, Toric code \cite{KITAEV20032} and weighted graph states (WGS) \cite{ahufinger06,hartmann_briegel_2007,Anders_2007,peng12} are also shown to be useful for quantum computation \cite{beyond1way07,grossnovel07}.

The original proposal of producing cluster states, which are necessary for MBQC,  solely employs nearest-neighbor Ising model \cite{briegel01}. However, long-range (LR) quantum spin models are naturally created by neutral atoms in optical lattices interacting via dipole interactions \cite{mamaev19} or trapped ions \cite{iontrap08,iontrap09,iontrap12,Islam_2011,Britton_2012} under Coulomb potential \cite{iontrap_cirac04}.   Furthermore, such LR models frequently exhibit critical phenomena and possess phases that are not captured by short-range (SR) quantum spin models
\cite{koffel2012,vodola2014,lr_ising_vodola_2016,lr_ising_defenu_2020,lr_model_romanroche2023,vodola23_prb}. For instance, counter-intuitive results in LR models include  breaking of the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem \cite{Mermin1966,Hohen1967,peter2012}, the rapid propagation of correlations \cite{Maghrebi2016,gong2017,ares2018,Ares_2019}, and violations of entanglement area law \cite{cramer2010,koffel2012,scha2013,cadarso2013}. 
In addition, it has been demonstrated that  on one hand, the ground or thermal states of the LR model possess a high multipartite entanglement or a more spreading of  bipartite entanglement and on the other hand, multipartite entangled states can also be  created through the LR models \cite{koffel2012,vodola2014,ren20,lakkaraju2020freezing,lgcl_asd_pla2021,lgcl_asd_pra2022,francica_22_prb, gong_cirac_23_prl}.


%Graph states are generated by simulation through long-range (LR) Ising systems. Scaling of block entanglement, two point correlation functions in LR  Ising-type interactions in static scenario are calculated in $d-$dimensional lattices of arbitrary geomtery \cite{dur_hartmann_prl_2005}. Nonclassical correlations like generalized geometric measure (GGM) \cite{aditi_pra_2010,biswas14}, discord \cite{Modi2012,olliver2001,Bera_2018}, concurrence \cite{coffman2000} in the subsystems of globally entangled equal weighted graph state with end-to-end connections have been discussed in \cite{mahto_shaji_pra_2022}. 

In this context,  it is interesting to explore the properties of the dynamical state obtained via interacting LR spin systems and its suitability for MBQC, starting from a suitable product state. In particular, investigations have focused on the scaling of block entanglement, two-point correlation function, multipartite entanglement \cite{aditi_pra_2010,biswas14}, and quantum discord \cite{olliver2001,Modi2012,Bera_2018} of the state following evolution under the LR Ising model \cite{dur_hartmann_prl_2005,mahto_shaji_pra_2022}. 
Moreover, random quantum circuits implementation by carrying out measurements on weighted graph states \cite{ran_circuit_by_wg08}, and robust entanglement concentration protocol \cite{economou2023} for generating high-fidelity Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states \cite{Greenberger2007}  have been proposed in the presence or absence of coherent and incoherent noise. 

% The LR spin models have been subject to analytical scrutiny \cite{lr_ising_vodola_2016, lr_ising_defenu_2020, lr_model_romanroche2023} and are acknowledged for their contribution to nontrivial physics. Extensive research on ground states of long-range quantum models has revealed intricate patterns of entanglement distribution \cite{lgcl_asd_pla2021, lgcl_asd_pra2022}, while the dynamical behavior has been observed to generate moteworthy entanglement between initially separable sites and foster high levels of multipartite entanglement in spin models \cite{lakkaraju2020freezing} and continuous variable systems \cite{anuradha2023cvggm}.

% Bipartite entanglement between nearest neighbor sites in the ground and thermal states has been demonstrated to serve as a means of detecting various quantum critical lines in spin models \cite{osterloh_amigo_fazio_nature_2002, osborne_neilsen_pra2002}. Furthermore, in studies involving dynamical processes employing a sudden quench protocol, the entanglement content within the dynamical state has also been examined as a detector for quantum critical lines in nearest neighbor spin models \cite{agarwal2021xxz, lakkaraju2023total}. Moreover, investigations have been conducted into the detection of transition lines in long-range spin models through dynamics \cite{lakkaraju2022tqpt} based on dynamical quantum phase transitions. Our study identify the transition line of the long-range Ising model by analyzing the multipartite entanglement it generates in the weighted graph state.

% Accordingly, weighted graph states corresponding to various lattice geometry and dimensions or varying interaction strength between the qubits beyond nearest neighbor (NN) interactions and effects of local measurements are undoubtedly a subject of attention in the near future.

% Apart from MBQC, requirement of longer sequence of gates to build universally programmable processors \cite{Debnath2016,Kandala2017,Figgatt2017,Arute2019,Kandala2019} prevents to achieve high implementation efficiency. Whereas the three qubit Toffoli gate [] can improve the last significantly, which alongwith single-qubit rotation gates also forms a universal set of quantum computation \cite{Shi2002BothTA}. Also, variational quantum algorithms like quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) \cite{farhi2014quantum,zhou_qaoa_20} can be used to simulate many body LR models. However, longer sequences of two-qubit gates are necessary to replicate LR interactions in many body systems, which introduce more noise into the system than single-qubit gates and increases with the number of qubits ($N$) up to $O(N!)$, finally disproving the superiority of quantum algorithms over classical ones. Therefore, the aim is to reduce the number of two-qubit gates, i.e., pairing interactions to deduce the effective LR Hamiltonian. Simulating LR systems in Google, IBM, D-Wave etc, dependent on gate based simulators can not be performed efficiently due to noise which shows the importance of generating multipartite entanglement of LR models by effective SR interactions.

 % Physical realization of variable long range Ising couplings between individual trapped ion spins \cite{iontrap08,iontrap09,Islam_2011,Britton_2012,iontrap12} have been done through the observation of strong Coulomb interaction between cold atomic ions \cite{iontrap_cirac04}. In contemporary research on superconducting circuits, investigations into higher dimensional operations have been conducted by leveraging intrinsic many-body interactions \cite{Song2017,Pedersen2019}, as well as by employing pairwise connections within extensively interconnected qubit networks \cite{ParallelSong2017,Song2019}. Moreover, these architectural frameworks have been utilized for the practical realization of various quantum algorithms, such as Deutsch-Jozsa \cite{deutsch1992}, Bernstein-Vazirani \cite{Bernstein1997}, and Grover's search \cite{grover1997}.

 %The LR spin models have been analytically studied \cite{lr_ising_vodola_2016, lr_ising_defenu_2020, lr_model_romanroche2023} and are known to give nontrivial physics. The ground states of long-range quantum models have shown rich entanglement distribution \cite{lgcl_asd_pla2021, lgcl_asd_pra2022}, whereas in dynamics, they have shown to produce non-trivial entanglement between the sites of a completely separable initial state while generating high multipartite entanglement in spin models \cite{lakkaraju2020freezing} and continuous variable systems \cite{anuradha2023cvggm}.



%Bipartite entanglement between nearest neighbor sites  in the ground and the thermal states has been shown to detect the various quantum critical lines in spin models \cite{osterloh_amigo_fazio_nature_2002, osborne_neilsen_pra2002}. In dynamical studies with sudden quench protocol, entanglement content in the dynamical state has also been studied as a detector for quantum critical lines in nearest neighbor spin models \cite{agarwal2021xxz, lakkaraju2023total}. Detection of transition lines of long-range spin models via dynamics have also been studied \cite{lakkaraju2022tqpt} based on dynamical quantum phase transitions. Here we detect the transition line of the long-range model by the multipartite entanglement it generates in the weighted graph state.

% In this work, we examine the inherent capabilities of graph states extending beyond NN interactions. We systematically examine the genuine multipartite entanglement (quantified by GGM) features of WGS in different power law ($1/r^\alpha$) regimes and different range of connections, known as coordination number $z$. The variable $r$ signifies the relative distance between two bodies, while $\alpha$ serves as a parameter governing the magnitude of the interaction. Specifically, we calculate closed form analytical expression of GGM for WGS which shows reach behavior with respect to time. We report that detection of $\alpha=1$ in one-dimension ($1$D) is possible through dynamical feature of GGM quantified by first-order  derivative of GGM at some particular time with respect to time or $\alpha$. Going beyond $1$D we show that time derivative of GGM at that time shows discontinus jump at $\alpha=2$ in two-dimesnional ($2$D) square lattice where as the critical point changes depending on the geometry of the lattice and eventually vanishes at some particular lattice geomtery. 

% Furthermore, we calculate the time-averaged GGM to show that WGS with higher number of qubits and end-to-end connection and  a fixed genuine entanglement content can be reduced to a WGS with lesser connections and also lesser number of qubits such that the entanglement content remains same upto certain error threshold. Specifically we calculate the minimum co-ordination numbers required to generate predetermined amount of GGM. Finally, we analyze the impact of local measurements on WGS on reducing number of qubits and entnaglement content. Noteably, we give the strategy to reduce the number of qubits in WGS.

The genuine multipartite entanglement \cite{meyer02,hashemi12,sadhukhan17,Gour2018monogamy,xie21} of the dynamical state in various geometries and its characteristics under local measurements have not yet been addressed in the context of variable-range (VR) interactions included in the evolution Hamiltonian for one- and two-dimensional ($2$D) lattices. On one hand, these investigations can highlight the potential of the evolved state as a resource in quantum information protocols and identify phases  and critical phenomena that are present in the evolution Hamiltonian. On the other hand, the impact of local measurements can indicate how to decouple certain parts of the circuits from the entire circuits, which can play a vital role on the performance of the computation. To accomplish this goal, we first show that the evolved state generated via VR interactions, referred to as weighted graph state,  is genuinely multipartite entangled (GME) having nonvanishing generalized geometric measure \cite{wei03} (GGM) \cite{aditi_pra_2010} and its pattern with time depends on the decay rate of interactions and the coordination number.  
Moreover, we know that the power-law decay in interactions of the LR transverse Ising model undergoes transitions from long-range to quasi-local and from quasi-local to local ones \cite{koffel2012,vodola2014,lr_ising_vodola_2016,lr_ising_defenu_2020,lr_model_romanroche2023,vodola23_prb}. We report that the time-derivatives and time-averaged GME content of the WGSs  can detect transitions, present in the fall-off rates in one- and  two-dimensional lattices. More importantly, we demonstrate that if the $2$D square lattice is distorted with an arbitrary angle, resulting in a hexagonal lattice, the discontinuity in the derivative of the multipartite entanglement with respect to time or fall-off rate can predict the transition points in the decay rate of the evolving Hamiltonian. Further, we determine that there exist  threshold values on the total number of qubits and coordination number above which the GME produced via VR interactions remains constant, thereby providing  lower bounds on the number of two-qubit gates required to simulate the interacting Hamiltonian used for producing WGS. The results can be important during the realization of the WGS in laboratories e.g., with superconducting qubits \cite{Song2017,ParallelSong2017,Pedersen2019,Song2019}.


Certain WGS with a minimal number of qubits may be necessary during the implementation of certain algorithms, and in such cases, the goal will be to generate WGS with a required number of qubits from the same state with an arbitrary number of qubits by making local measurements. For cluster state, such a measurement approach is well known \cite{rauss_pra2003}. In this paper, we present a local measurement strategy that allows us to  obtain local unitary equivalent WGS with adjusted weights.



The paper is structured in the following manner. In Sec. \ref{sec:Weighted Graph State}, we introduce the exact expression  of the WGS in various lattice geometries. The closed forms of GGM are calculated in Sec. \ref{sec:GGMWG}. Using the trends of GGM, detection of transitions in the fall-off rates of the evolution Hamiltonian  is presented in Sec. \ref{sec:alpha_indicator} while the investigations of emulating the GME in the LR  model through the SR  ones is examined in Sec. \ref{sec:mimick}. We discuss the impact of local measurements on the WGS in Sec. \ref{sec:measurement_effect}.  The concluding remarks is included in Sec. \ref{sec:conclu}.


\section{Generation of Weighted Graph State via long-range Hamiltonian with varying interaction strength}
\label{sec:Weighted Graph State}

% \subsection{Graph state/Weighted graph state}
A weighted graph state of $N$ parties can be expressed by an underlying graph $G=(V,E)$, with the $N$ parties forming the set of vertices, $V=\{1,2,\ldots,N\}$ connected by a set of edges, $E\subset V\times V$ based on the interactions among the parties. The adjacency matrix of $G$ is $\Phi_E=(\phi_{ij})$, where the weight $\phi_{ij}$ denotes the interaction between the parties (vertices) $i$ and $j$. We consider real weights, i.e., $\Phi_E$ is real and symmetric matrix. Therefore the underlying graph $G$ is simple and undirected, i.e. $\phi_{ii}=0$ and $\phi_{ij}=\phi_{ji}\forall (i,j)\in V\times V$.
% Figure environment removed

To construct a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ graph state, each vertex is a qubit initialized in $\ket{+}=(\ket{0}+\ket{1})/\sqrt{2}$, where $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ are the eigenstates of the Pauli matrix $\sigma_z$ with the corresponding eigenvalues $1$ and $-1$. Furthermore, two-qubit interacting unitary, $U_{ij}=e^{-i H_{ij}t} \forall i,j\in V$, acts on each vertices, entangling the pairs of qubits (creating the edges) which is achieved by the two-qubit Hamiltonian,  $H_{ij}=\phi_{ij}\Big(\frac{1-\sigma_z^{(i)}}{2}\Big)\Big(\frac{1-\sigma_z^{(j)}}{2}\Big) $. Hence, the unitary transformation, in this case, takes the diagonal form as $U_{ij}=\text{diag}(1,1,1,e^{-i g_{ij}(t)})$, 
% \begin{eqnarray}
%     \nonumber U_{ij} &=& e^{-i\phi_{ij}\Big(\frac{1-\sigma_z^{(i)}}{2}\Big)\Big(\frac{1-\sigma_z^{(j)}}{2}\Big)t}\\ 
 %   &=& 
    %\begin{pmatrix}
%1 & 0 & 0&0\\
%0 & 1 & 0&0\\
%0&0&1&0\\
%0&0&0& e^{-i g_{ij}(t)}
%  \end{pmatrix} \\
  % &=&\text{diag}(1,1,1,e^{-i g_{ij}(t)}),
  % \label{eq:uij}
% \end{eqnarray} 
known as the controlled-phase gate with $g_{ij}(t)=\phi_{ij}t$. Here, $\phi_{ij}$, which comprises the information of the range and strength of the interaction, is constant throughout the time. Therefore, the total interacting Hamiltonian acting on the graph can be written as $H=\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j>i}^N H_{ij}$

Notice that the Hamiltonian remains unchanged under the exchange of two index, $H_{ij}=H_{ji}$ and $[H_{ij},H_{jk}]=0$, which satisfies the criteria for the graph having undirected and unordered edges respectively. Finally, the graph state for $N$-party system can be expressed as 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \ket{\Psi_G(t)}_N &=&\prod_{i,j} U_{ij}(t) \ket{+}^{\otimes N}.
    \label{eq:wgs_def}
\end{eqnarray}

Considering only nearest neighbor interactions in $1$D, i.e., $H=\sum_i H_{i,i+1}$ and setting $\phi_{i,i+1}t=(2n-1)\pi$ for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, (with $\mathbb{N}$ being the set of natural numbers) which transforms the edge connecting unitaries to be $U_{i,i+1}=\text{diag}(1,1,1,-1)\equiv \text{CNOT}$, we get the well known MBQC resource state, known as the cluster state \cite{briegel01} having the form, $\ket{\Psi_G((2n-1)\pi)}_N =\frac{1}{2^{N/2}} \bigotimes_{i=1}^N\big(\ket{0}_i+\ket{1}_i\sigma_{i+1}^z\big), $
using the convention that $\sigma_{N+1}^z=\mathbb{I}$ in the open boundary condition.

Instead of this simplified  scenario, we concentrate on more general experimentally viable picture of all-to-all connectivity with power law interaction strength, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
    \phi_{ij}=|i-j|^{-\alpha}=r_{ij}^{-\alpha},
    \label{eq:stre_open}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha \geq 0$ dictates the decay rate of the power law interactions and $r_{ij}$ denotes the spatial distance between the lattice sites, $i$ and $j$ . For $1$D spin system, $r=|i-j|$, whereas for a $2$D  square lattice, $r=|\va{i}-\va{j}|$, which is the Euclidean distance between the site at $\va{i}$ and the site at $\va{j}$. For example, $r=1$ represents the nearest-neighbor (NN) sites in both $1$D and the $2$D square lattice, while $r=2$ and $r=\sqrt{2}$ are the distance of the next nearest-neighbor (NNN) in $1$D and the $2$D square lattice respectively (see Fig. \ref{fig:schematic3} for illustration). For $N=2$, one obtains the corresponding state, $\ket{\Psi(t)}_2 = \frac{1}{2}\big(\ket{00}+\ket{01}+\ket{10}+e^{-i g_{1 2}}\ket{11}\big)$, where $g_{12} = \phi_{12}t$. Similarly, for $N=3$, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
    \nonumber \ket{\Psi(t)}_3 &=& \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\big(\ket{000}+\ket{001}+\ket{010}+e^{-i g_{2 3}}\ket{011} \\ \nonumber &+& \ket{100}+e^{-i g_{1 3}}\ket{101}+e^{-i g_{1 2}}\ket{110}\\ &+& e^{-i (g_{1 2}+g_{1 3}+g_{2 3})}\ket{111}\big),
    \label{eq:3qubit_all}
\end{eqnarray}
with each $g_{ij}=\phi_{ij}t$, defining the weights of the graph. From the above form of the states, we see that for $N$-qubit state expressed in the $2^N$ computational basis, the coefficient of the basis vectors $\{\ket{\eta}=\ket{a_1 a_2 \ldots a_N}\}$ where $\eta$ is the decimal equivalent of $\ket{a_1 a_2 \ldots a_N}$ with $a_i=\ket{0},\ket{1} \, \forall i$ turns out to be $c_{\eta}(t)=\exp\bigg(-i\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j>i}^N g_{i j}(t) \delta_{a_i}^1 \delta_{a_j}^1\bigg)$. Therefore, the $N$-qubit weighted graph state  can be written as 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \nonumber \ket{\Psi_G(t)}_N &=&\frac{1}{2^{N/2}}\sum_{\eta=0}^{2^N-1}\exp\Big(-i\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j>i}^{N} g_{i j}(t)\delta_{a_i}^1\delta_{a_j}^1\Big)\ket{\eta} \\ &=& \frac{1}{2^{N/2}}\sum_{\eta=0}^{2^N-1}c_\eta(t)\ket{\eta}.
    \label{eq:wgs}
\end{eqnarray}
Interestingly, we will demonstrate that the coefficients of $c_{\eta}(t)$ carrying the signature of variable-range interactions of the system can reveal counter-intuitive properties which conventional cluster state does not possess.

Let us consider $2$D lattices by introducing a distortion in the $2$D square lattice of size $L\times L$, such that for a site $\va{i}$, with the index $(i_x, i_y)$, $i_x\in[1,L]$, $i_y\in[1,L]$ with $i_x,i_y\in\mathbb{N}$, the distortion is following:\\
 \textit{Case I- $i_x+i_y$ is even}. Sites indexed $(i_x+1, i_y)$, $(i_x, i_y-1)$ and $(i_x, i_y+1)$ are the nearest neighbor sites. and the angle between vectors joining $(i_x, i_y)$ to $(i_x, i_y+1)$ and $(i_x, i_y)$ to $(i_x+1, i_y)$ is $\Theta\geq90^\circ$. \\
 \textit{Case II- $i_x+i_y$ is odd}. Sites indexed $(i_x-1, i_y)$, $(i_x, i_y-1)$ and $(i_x, i_y+1)$ are the nearest neighbor sites and the angle between vectors joining $(i_x, i_y)$ to $(i_x, i_y+1)$ and $(i_x, i_y)$ to $(i_x-1, i_y)$ is $\Theta\geq90^\circ$.
 
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:schematic3},  $\Theta=90^\circ$ represents the square lattice while $\Theta=120^\circ$ corresponds to the honeycomb lattice, where the lattice is tiled by regular hexagons. For arbitrary lattice angle $\Theta$, the $2$D lattice is deformed and is tiled by symmetric but non-regular hexagons with distance between one pair of parallel side less than the distance between the other two parallel pairs of the hexagon, and the pair with the smallest side oriented in one axis ($x$-axis in Fig. \ref{fig:schematic3}). The lattice is scaled such that the nearest neighbors are separated by a unit distance.  Note that this deformation reduces the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry of the square lattice to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry for other lattice structures in Fig. \ref{fig:schematic3}

% \dg{Though Eq. (\ref{eq:stre_open}) is the general expression for the ineraction strength between two lattice point (in 1D) but stil it needs modification for periodic lattice depending on the nomenclature of the lattice. For reference in the Fig. \dg{(figure no)}  for open boundary strength between lattice point 1 and 6 is $\phi_{16}=r_{16}^{-\alpha}=5^{-\alpha}$. But in the fig. (\ref{fig:schematic2}) for closed boundary this strength changes to $\phi_{16}=r_{16}^{-\alpha}=3^{-\alpha}$ as dictates by different colour (shades). So for $r_{ij}=|i-j|$ in closed boundary this takes the modified form as \\
% \begin{eqnarray}
%     \phi_{ij} = [\min(r_{ij},N-r_{ij})]^{-\alpha}
%     \label{eq:stre_closed}
% \end{eqnarray}}

% \subsection{Introduce Hamiltonian}
% We introduce the Hamiltonian of $\mathcal{N}$ spin-1/2 qubits here with, not only the nearest-neighbor interaction, all possible interaction. Also this long range Hamiltonian has different interaction strength between different lattice site which make this model very realistic rather than equal weight for every interaction. We are dealing with the situation where the coupling strength between two spins follow certain kinds of distance law (basically power law decay) which make the model more realistic. So this long range fully connected weighted Hamiltonian is of the form
% \begin{eqnarray}
%      H &=& \sum_{k=1}^{\mathcal{N}-1}\sum_{l>k}^\mathcal{N} g(k,l)\Big(\frac{1-\sigma_z^{(k)}}{2}\Big)\Big(\frac{1-\sigma_z^{(l)}}{2}\Big) \nonumber \\
%      & = &  \sum_{k=1}^{\mathcal{N}-1}\sum_{l>k}^\mathcal{N} H_{kl}
%      \label{eq:Hmain}
% \end{eqnarray}

%    The coupling strength $g(k,l,t)$ can be time dependent or time independent. We take this to be time independent as $g(k,l,t)=g(k,l)$. And also it is only depends on the the distance between two spins $r_{kl}$ as $g(k,l)=g(r_{kl})$. So the arbitrary distance dependence(coupling strength) is

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item For periodic boundary 
%     \begin{eqnarray}
%    g(k,l)&=&[\text{min}(r_{kl},N-r_{kl})]^{-\alpha}
%     \end{eqnarray}
%     \item For open boundary 
%     \begin{eqnarray}
%     g(k,l)&=&r_{kl}^{-\alpha}
%     \end{eqnarray}
% \end{enumerate}
% for $r_{kl}=|k-l|$. The parameter $\alpha$ has some physical significance. Depending on $\alpha$ the nature of the Hamiltonian can change. For large value of $\alpha$ this long range Hamiltonian convert into the Nearest neighbor Ising type Hamiltonian.

% \subsection{$\mathcal{N}$ party Weighted Graph State }
% In this section we show how to write the expression of an arbitrary $\mathcal{N}$ party Weighted Graph State (WGS) along with the range of interaction which can be only nearest neighbor or next nearest neighbor or can be fully connected.The graph state consisting of vertices $V$ and the edges $E$ 
% \begin{eqnarray}
%     G&=&G(E,V)
% \end{eqnarray}


% We can relate this graph state with any physical system of quantum mechanics. The vertices corresponding to the physical particle or local quantum system $k$ and $l$ (qubits in spin 1/2 system in our case) and the edges corresponding to the interaction (unitary transformation) between the $k$th and $l$th particle as 
% \begin{eqnarray}
% U_{kl}&=&
%     \begin{pmatrix}
% 1 & 0 & 0&0\\
% 0 & 1 & 0&0\\
% 0&0&1&0\\
% 0&0&0& e^{-i \phi_{kl}}
%   \end{pmatrix}
% \end{eqnarray}

% Irrespective of the dimensionality $d$ the spins are so arranged that initially they are completely ploarized in the $x$ direction. So we have taken the initial state as $\ket{\psi(t=0)}=\ket{+}^{\otimes \mathcal{N}}$. This class of state are very important in quantum computing.\\
% Here $H_{kl}$ is the Hamiltonian what we  consider. Also $\phi_{kl}=g(k,l)t$ as our Hamiltonian is time independent.
% Now to make life simple we are considering the uni directed graph $U_{kl}=U_{lk}$. Where the unitary remains similar after the interchange of the vertices. So we can define our weighted graph state as
% \begin{eqnarray}
%     \ket{G}&=&\prod_{k,l} U_{kl} \ket{+}^{\otimes \mathcal{N}}
% \end{eqnarray}

% We consider the unitary as $U_{kl}=\text{diag}(1, 1, 1, e^{-i \phi_{kl}})$ (for $\phi_{kl}=\pi$ this is CNOT gate). So the state can be written as 
% \begin{eqnarray}
%     \ket{\psi(t)}&=&\sum_{\eta=0}^{2^N-1}\exp\Big(-i\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\sum_{l>k}^{N}\phi_{kl}\delta_{a_k}^1\delta_{a_l}^1\Big)\ket{\eta}
% \end{eqnarray}
% where $\eta$ is decimal equivalent of the state that is $\ket{\eta}=\ket{a_1a_2a_3\dots }$ for all $i$, $a_i=0,1$ and $k,l$ are the position of the qubits.\\

% \textcolor{red}{How to find eq. (2) -- detailed discussion to be added}

% % We can construct the recursion relation between the $N$ party state and the $N+1$ party state. 
% % \begin{align}
% %     \ket{N+1}=\ket{N}\otimes\ket{\psi_1}_{N+1}
% % \end{align}
% % where

\section{Genuine Multipartite entanglement in Weighted Graph State}
\label{sec:GGMWG}

Let us analyze the multipartite entanglement content of the WGS originated from the variable-range interacting evolution operator. As we will illustrate, such investigations establish capability of WGS as a resource for quantum information processing task and at the same time, can uncover quantum features of the evolution Hamiltonian. To characterize its resource, we focus on its genuine multipartite entanglement content. A multipartite pure state is genuinely multipartite entangled  when it is not separable across any bipartition. Although numerous multipartite entanglement measures \cite{Blasone2008,
Or2008,Vidal2008,Rom2008,Wei2010, Eisert01, meyer02,hashemi12,sadhukhan17,Gour2018monogamy,xie21,wei03} are proposed which are shown to be crucial for quantum information protocols \cite{buzek97,hillery99,bruss04,Shi_2010}, they are not always easy to compute, specially for large system size. We choose generalized geometric measure to quantify its GME content. The GGM, $\mathcal{G}$, is a distance-based measure, defined as the distance of a given state from the set of non-genuinely multiparty entangled states. For a given \(N\)-party pure state, $|\psi\rangle$, GGM can be computed by the expression written as
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{G}(|\psi\rangle) = 1-\max_{A:B}\{\lambda^2_{A:B} | A\cup B = \{1,2,\dots\}, A\cap B=\O \},
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $B$ are any arbitrary bipartitions of the multiparty state, and $\lambda_{A:B}$ is the maximum Schmidt coefficients in the $A:B$ bipartition.

\subsection{Computation of reduced density matrices of WGS}

From the definition of the GGM, we know that the largest eigenvalue among all the bipartitions of the given state  contributes to the computation of GGM.  We use the projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) description of the weighted graph states \cite{verstraete_pra_2004, dur_hartmann_prl_2005, hartmann_briegel_2007} to evaluate the reduced density matrices. We argue that the single-site reduced density matrix has maximal Schmidt coefficients among all possible density matrices.

% description of PEPS
For a all-to-all connected WGS, each qubit is acted upon by $N-1$ commuting unitaries and, therefore, a single qubit can be replaced by $N-1$ virtual qubits, each in the $\ket{+}$ state initially. The $\bar{k}_l$ virtual qubit in $k$th site interacts the $\bar{l}_k$ virtual qubit at site $l$ by the unitary $U_{kl}$. These virtual qubits now form $N(N-1)/2$ valence bond pairs, and each unitary acts on each valence bond pair independently, in the complex Hilbert space  $(\mathbb{C}^2)^{N(N-1)}$. Therefore, the weighted graph state in Eq. (\ref{eq:wgs_def}) can be written upto normalization as $\ket{\bar{\Psi}_G(t)}= \underset{\bar{k}_l \bar{l}_k}{\otimes}\ket{\zeta}_{\bar{k}_l \bar{l}_k} = \underset{\bar{k}_l \bar{l}_k}{\otimes}U_{kl} \ket{+}_{\bar{k}_l}\ket{+}_{\bar{l}_k}$ where 
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\zeta}_{\bar{k}_l \bar{l}_k} = \frac{1}{2}\big(\ket{0_{\bar{k}_l}0_{\bar{l}_k}}+\ket{0_{\bar{k}_l}1_{\bar{l}_k}}+\ket{1_{\bar{k}_l}0_{\bar{l}_k}}+e^{-i g_{kl}}\ket{1_{\bar{k}_l}1_{\bar{l}_k}}\big).
\end{equation}
The original state is now recovered upto normalization by local projection, $P_k = \ket{0}_k\bra{0_{\bar{k}_1}0_{\bar{k}_2}\dots0_{\bar{k}_{N-1}}}+\ket{1}_k\bra{1_{\bar{k}_1}1_{\bar{k}_2}\dots1_{\bar{k}_{N-1}}}$, i.e., for each original qubit, the $N-1$ virtual qubit is now projected back to the two-dimensional Hilbert space, where only the completely polarized states of virtual qubits (all $\ket{0}$ and all $\ket{1}$) at a particular site is projected out. Finally, the weighted graph state as given in Eq. (\ref{eq:wgs}) is recovered.
An all-to-all connected WGS with the underlying graph as $G=(V,V\times V)$ has the adjacency matrix $\Phi_E=(\phi_{ij})$ defining the controlled-phase gates $U_{ij}$.  
%Without loss of generality, each site of the initial separable state can be taken to be the $\ket{+}$ state, as each site is a pure state which is local (single-site) unitarily connected to the $\ket{+}$ state. 
%These local unitaries do not change the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of any subsystem.

For the state $\displaystyle \ket{\Psi_G}=\Big(\prod_{(i,j)\in V\times V} U_{ij}\Big) \Big(\bigotimes_{k\in V}\ket{+}_k\Big)$, an arbitrary bipartition is done by dividing the sites into two subsystems $A$ and $B$, such that $A\cup B=V$ and $A\cap B=\emptyset$. To write the local density matrix of a subsystem $A$, we take the partial trace of the density matrix of the whole system over the subsystem $B$. Therefore, the unitaries which act only on the sites in the subsystem $B$, i.e., $U_{ij}$ such that $i,j\in B$, annihilates, due to their commuting nature and the cyclic property of trace. We can express the reduced density matrix of the subsystem $A$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \rho_{A}&=&\sum_{k,k^\prime\in A}U_{k,k^\prime}\trace_B[\ket{\Psi^\prime}\bra{\Psi^\prime}]U^\dagger_{k,k^\prime}=\sum_{k,k^\prime\in A}U_{k,k^\prime}\rho^\prime_{A}U^\dagger_{k,k^\prime},\nonumber\\
    \ket{\Psi^\prime}&=&\bigotimes\limits_{k\in A,l\in B}^{}U_{k,l}\ket{+}_k\ket{+}_l.
    \label{eq:psi_reduced}
\end{eqnarray}
Since the unitaries $U_{k,k^\prime}$ act on the subsystems of $A$, so the eigenvalues of $\rho_A$ and $\rho_A^\prime=\trace_B[\ket{\Psi^\prime}\bra{\Psi^\prime}]$ are same. With a subsystem $A$ of $n$ sites ($1\leq n<N$), the underlying graph of $\ket{\Psi^\prime}$ is $G^\prime\subset G$ with only the edge where each site of $A$ is connected to each site of $B$, contributing to the eigenvalues. Computing the reduced density matrices $\rho_A^\prime$ by using $\ket{\bar{\Psi}^\prime}$ which is $\ket{\Psi^\prime}$ in the PEPS formalism, involves $3$ steps to keep track of indices in Eq. (\ref{eq:psi_reduced}).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Projection on virtual qubits in $B$: $\ket{\Psi^P}=P_B\ket{\bar{\Psi}^\prime}=\bigotimes\limits_{l\in B}^{}\left[\prod_{k\in A}U_{kl} \ket{+}_{\bar{k}_l}\ket{+}_l\right]$.
    \item Partial trace over $B$: $\bar{\rho}_A = \bigotimes_{l\in B}\bar{\rho}_A(l)$, where each term is described in Eq. (\ref{eq:rho_l}) in  Appendix\ref{sec:WGS_PEPS}. 
    \item Projection on virtual qubits in $A$: $\rho^\prime_A=\underset{l\in B}{\ostar}\bar{\rho}_A(l)$, where $\ostar$ is the element-wise product of matrices, known as the Hadamard (\textit{Schur}) product.
\end{enumerate}

These are further explained in  Appendix \ref{sec:WGS_PEPS}. For following discussion, we use the final Hadamard product form of $\rho^\prime_A$.

%\subsubsection{Single-site reduced density matrices}
The above procedure can be easily followed for computing single-site reduced density matrices for $A_k=\{k\}$ i.e., $|A_k|=n=1$. The $k$th single-site reduced density matrix of the system can be written as $\rho_k = \underset{l\in B}{\ostar}\rho_k(l)$ where  $\rho_k(l)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\ket{+}_k\bra{+}_k+\ket{\chi_l}_k\bra{\chi_l}_k\right)$, with $\ket{\chi_l}_k=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{0}_k+e^{-i \phi_{kl}}\ket{1}_k\right)$. The closed form of (normalized) $\rho_k$ can be expressed as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \rho_k=\begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2^N}\prod_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq k}}^N(1+e^{i \phi_{kj}})\\
    \frac{1}{2^N}\prod_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq k}}^N(1+e^{-i \phi_{kj}}) & \frac{1}{2}
  \end{pmatrix}.
  \label{eq:single_site}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Maximizing Schmidt value of weighted graph state}

% \begin{theorem}
% For a WGS prepared from a completely separable state by the action of Controlled-phase gates, the single site density matrices provide the largest eigenvalue among all the subsystems of a large system.
% \label{th:1}
% \end{theorem}

% \begin{proof}
% Consider an arbitrary bipartition $A:B$, such that $A=\{k_1, k_2,\dots k_n\}$ and $B=\{l_1, l_2,\dots l_{N-n}\}$ of an $N$ qubit WGS. Consider the set of matrices $\{\Omega_p\}$, such that $\Omega_p=\underset{1\leq i\leq p}{\ostar}\bar{\rho}_A(l_i)$ is the sequence of consecutive Hadamard products of $\bar{\rho}_A(l_i)$'s upto $l_p$ ($p\leq N-n$). Clearly, $\Omega_1=\bar{\rho}_A(l_1)$ and $\Omega_{N-n}=\bar{\rho}_A$. By Schur's theorem, Hadamard product of positive semi-definite matrices is a semi-definite matrix. Therefore, all $\Omega_p$ are positive semi-definite matrices (with diagonal entries $1$).  Using the theorem $5.5.12$ in \cite{horn_johnson_1991}, eigenvalues of $\bar{\rho}_A(l_1)$ are majorized by the eigenvalues of $\bar{\rho}_A(l_1)\otimes\bar{\rho}_A(l_2)$. Therefore, the maximum eigenvalues ($\lambda^{max}(\Omega_i)$ of $\Omega_i$ follows the inequality  $\lambda^{max}(\Omega_2)\leq\lambda^{max}(\Omega_1)$. Therefore, by induction on the set $\{\Omega_p\}$, $\lambda^{max}(\Omega_{N-n})\leq \lambda^{max}(\Omega_1)$, which implies $\lambda^{max}(\bar{\rho}_A)\leq \lambda^{max}(\bar{\rho}_A(l_1))$.

% The maximum eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of $A$ with $n$ sites, is $\nu^{max}_A=\frac{\lambda_{max}(\bar{\rho}_A)}{2^n}\leq \frac{\lambda_{max}(\bar{\rho}_A(l_1))}{2^n}=\nu^{max}_{l_1}$. The last inequality follows from the fact that $\frac{\bar{\rho}_A(l_1)}{2^n}$ is the reduced density matrix of the WGS with $n+1$ sites and vertices as $A\cup\{l_1\}$. Therefore, the eigenvalues of reduced density matrix of $A$ in this new graph $G^\prime$ are equal to the eigenvalues of single site reduced density matrix at site $l_1$ in $G^\prime$. This shows that the maximum eigenvalues of any bipartitions $A:B$ are less than the eigenvalues of the single site density matrices.
% \end{proof}

By calculating GGM numerically upto $N=16$, we find that the maximum eigenvalue always comes from the single-site reduced density matrices. Combining both analytical and numerical results, the closed form of GGM for the WGS, by diagonalizing the single-site density matrix in Eq. (\ref{eq:single_site}), can be given as
\begin{equation}
     \mathcal{G}(N,z,\alpha,t)=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\Bigg|\prod_{r=1}^z\cos\bigg(\frac{t}{2r^{\alpha}}\bigg)\Bigg|,
     \label{eq:ggm_open}
\end{equation}
where $z$ is the range of the interaction, which can also be referred to as the coordination number. 
% For periodic lattice,
% \begin{equation}
%    \mathcal{G}(N,z,\alpha,t)=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\Bigg|\prod_{r=1}^{z}\cos\bigg(\frac{t}{2\min(r,N-r)^{\alpha}}\bigg)\Bigg|
%    \label{eq:ggm_closed}
% \end{equation}
 Note that for all-to-all connected lattice, we have $1\leq z \leq N-1$.

% \kda{Corolaries are not true in 2-d}
%\begin{corollary}
{\bf Remark 1.} Unavoidable period exists in the weighted graph state if all the weights are rational numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$).
%\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    The product of cosines can be written as a sum of cosines. For a WGS with the GGM contribution from the site $p$, with weights $J_{pj}$ of different sites $j$, GGM can be expressed as
    \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{G}(\{J_{pj}\},t) = \frac{1}{2}\left(1-\sum\limits_{perm \in \mathcal{S}}^{}\cos\sum_{i}\Big((-1)^{perm(i)}J_{pi}\Big)t\right),
        \label{eq:cos_sum}
    \end{equation}
    where $\mathcal{S}$ is a set of $N$-bit strings with the first bit as $0$. Therefore, the cardinality of $\mathcal{S}$ is $2^{N-1}$. The total sum over $\mathcal{S}$ denotes the different possible summations that arise in the conversion of product of cosines to sum of cosines.

    The sum of cosines has a period which is the lowest common multiple of all the arguments in cosines. Therefore,  the weights $J_{pi}\in\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathcal{G}$ is periodic in $t$, which in the case of $\alpha=1$, scales as $O(N!)$.
\end{proof}

{\bf Remark 2.}
The weighted graph state has no period if $\alpha$ is not an integer in $1$D.

%\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    If $\alpha\notin\mathbb{N}$, $J_{pi}\notin\mathbb{Q}$, which follows from the Eq. (\ref{eq:cos_sum}), shows that $\mathcal{G}$ is aperiodic.
\end{proof}

\section{Recognizing transition in fall-off rates via GGM of Graph states }
\label{sec:alpha_indicator}

To create the weighted graph state with the help of LR Ising Hamiltonian having $z=N-1$, the initial state is taken to be the equal superposition of all the elements in the computational basis, which is a fully separable  state having vanishing GGM. Suppose at time $t<0$, there is a strong magnetic field (with respect to the nearest-neighbor interaction strength) in the positive $x$-direction, causing the initial state to be completely polarised in the $\ket{+}$ state \cite{Kyaw_2018}. At $t>0$, sudden quench to the LR Ising Hamiltonian by abruptly turning off the magnetic field also leads to the WGS. The amount of multipartite entanglement generated in the resultant network depends upon the weight of the connection between the vertices, determined by the decay rate of the evolving Hamiltonian and the coordination number.

\subsection{Detection of transition in decaying rate with weighted graph state in 1D}

Based on the LR system Hamiltonian and the underlying lattice, the decay rate $\alpha$ possesses various transition points which separates the non-local (strong long-range order) from the quasi-local (weak-long range) order ($\alpha^*_{LR}$) and the quasi-local order from the local (short-range) one ($\alpha^*_{SR}$) in the ground state of the system. In the quantum spin models, analysis shows that $\alpha^*_{LR}=d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the lattice, exhibits the transition from long-range to quasi-local region \cite{koffel2012,vodola2014,lr_ising_vodola_2016,lr_ising_defenu_2020,lr_model_romanroche2023,vodola23_prb}. 
%We indicate thatsuch a transition point is also present in the dynam-ics of the system where a weighted graph state is

Let us demonstrate the trends of multipartite entanglement in the WGS constructed from the underlying long range model can capture the transition point in the decay rate $\alpha$.

%The concept of multiparty entanglement encompasses the entanglement that arises among multiple sites within the model. We compute GGM, $\mathcal{G}$ of the weighted graph state denoted in Eq. (\ref{eq:ggm_open}) and shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ggm_signal} for $1$D chain. 
\textbf{GGM of the weighted graph state in $1$D}. Let us first examine the behavior of GGM of WGS generated via variable-range interaction for different values of $\alpha$ in $1$D (see Fig. \ref{fig:ggm_signal} in which the behavior of $\mathcal{G}$ with the valuation of time for different $\alpha$ is shown). For any  $\alpha$ in the weighted graph states, the  maximum value of GGM, $\mathcal{G}=0.5$ is achieved at $t=(2n-1)\pi \forall n\in \mathbb{N}$, since GGM in case of the evolving Hamiltonian with the nearest-neighbor interactions, i.e., $z=1$ is independent of $\alpha$ in Eq. (\ref{eq:ggm_open}) and $\cos \frac{t}{2r^\alpha} =0$ $\forall \alpha$ and $r=1$. To detect the transition between non-local and quasi-local/local regimes, we use two identifiers, given by
\begin{equation}
    \bar{\mathcal{G}}_{2\pi}(\alpha)=\left.\frac{d\mathcal{G}(\alpha,t)}{dt}\right|_{t=2\pi};\quad \frac{d\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}}{d\alpha}(\alpha)=\frac{d}{d\alpha}\mathcal{G}(\alpha,t=2\pi).
\end{equation}
Let us first discuss the extreme points.  $\alpha=0$ corresponds to a uniform graph state where each vertex is connected to every other vertex with identical weights \cite{mahto_shaji_pra_2022}; and $\alpha\to\infty$ leads to a graph state with uniform weights involving with the nearest-neighbor  vertices \cite{briegel01, rauss_pra2003}. It  becomes the cluster state  at $t=\pi,3\pi,5\pi,\ldots$ and GGM of the dynamical state obtained through NN interacting Hamiltonian is oscillatory, with the time period of $2\pi$, i.e.,  $\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}=0$ and $\bar{\mathcal{G}}_{2\pi}=0$. For any finite $\alpha$, the weights of the all connections contribute, such that these weights decrease polynomially with the increasing distance between vertices ($\phi_{i,i+r}=r^{-\alpha}$). For large $\alpha$, connections other than the nearest neighbors ($\phi_{i,i+1}=1)$ are extremely small and $\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}$ remains close to zero. With the decrease of $\alpha$, the long range connections start to increase. GGM at all times, typically $\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}$is nonvanishing since the absolute product of cosines at $t=2\pi$ in the second term of Eq. (\ref{eq:ggm_open}) keeps on decreasing from unity. On the other hand, at $\alpha=1$, the next-nearest-neighbor makes $\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}=0.5$ since $\cos\frac{2\pi}{4}=0$. When $\alpha$  goes below unity, weights of further distance makes the absolute cosine product almost near zero. This observation serves as a compelling incentive for employing GGM in the identification of $\alpha^*_{LR}$ transition point.

\textbf{Identifying transitions in falling rate in $1$D.} First, notice that $\bar{\mathcal{G}}_{2\pi}$ vanishes until $\alpha \approx 0.7$ and it takes negative value upto $\alpha_{LR}^*=1$ while for $\alpha>\alpha_{LR}^*$, $\bar{\mathcal{G}}_{2\pi}$ abruptly changes to a positive value and starts increasing as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:detection}. Secondly, similar discontinuity at $\alpha_{LR}^*$ can also be observed from the quantity $\dv{\mathcal{G}(\alpha,t=2\pi)}{\alpha}=\dv{\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}}{\alpha}$. Both derivatives of GME of the dynamical state, $\bar{\mathcal{G}}_{2\pi}(\alpha)$ and $\dv{\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}}{\alpha}$, can successfully identify the transition at $\alpha_{LR}^*=1$ from non-local to quasi-local regimes in $1$D by changing its characteristic instantly.

Let us determine whether GME is capable to detect another transition point present $\alpha_{LR}^*$. To examine it, we first define the averaged GGM, $\langle \mathcal{G}\rangle_T$ with averaging being performed over time, $t=T$ as 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_T &=& \frac{\int_0^{T}\mathcal{G}(t)dt}{T}.
\end{eqnarray}
Since $\mathcal{G}$ typically shows some repetitive behavior, with time $T$, the upper limit can be chosen according to such repetitions in $\mathcal{G}$. Extensive numerical simulations indicate that $T=3\pi$ is a good choice as it can capture all the features considered in this work. For $\alpha\rightarrow \infty$ which corresponds to the nearest-neighbor case, we have $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_{T=3\pi}\equiv0.18$ while it reaches its maximum value, $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_{T=3\pi}\equiv0.5$ for $\alpha=0$. In the intermediate $\alpha$, we observe contrasting behavior in $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_{T}$ when $0<\alpha<2$, i.e., the evolving Hamiltonian belong to the long-range and quasi-local domains, $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle$ sharply decreases with the increase of $\alpha$ as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:avg_ggm}, $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_{T}$ remains almost constant with $\alpha>>2$, i.e., when the dynamical state arises due to the short range interaction. It indicates that the time-averaged GGM carries signature of the transition point separating long and quasi-local from the short range model.

%The contrasting behaviors exhibited in non-local and quasi-local/local regimes of $1$D weighted graph states can be discerned through the first-order non-analyticity of $\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}$, as well as the discontinuity of $\bar{\mathcal{G}}_{2\pi}$ at $\alpha=1$, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:detection}. The quantity $\bar{\mathcal{G}}_{2\pi}$ have zero value as $\alpha$ starts from $0$ and remains so until $\alpha \approx 0.7$. After which it exhibits positive value of the order of $10^{-3}$ for a small interval and near the transition point $\alpha^*_{LR}=1$, it shows different behavior for $\alpha<\alpha^*_{LR}$ (negative and decreasing), and for $\alpha>\alpha^*_{LR}$ (positive and increasing), with the discontinuity of the order of $10^{-1}$. Similarly, $\frac{d\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}}{d\alpha}$ also detects the critical point, with the discontinuity of order of $10^{-2}$.

%First derivative of $\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}$ with respect to $\alpha$ for $1$D is near zero in the non-local regimes, i.e. $\alpha<1$ for $1$D chain. Near the transition point $\alpha^*_{LR}=1$, it shows different behavior for $\alpha<\alpha^*_{LR}$ (positive and increasing), and for $\alpha>\alpha^*_{LR}$ (negative and decreasing), with the discontinuity of the order of $10^{-1}$. Similarly, $\bar{\mathcal{G}}_{2\pi}$ also detects, with the discontinuity of order of $10^{-2}$.
 
\subsection{Determining transition in higher dimensional lattices via GGM.} 
%Similar to the $1$D linear lattice, both the $\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}$ and $\bar{\mathcal{G}}_{2\pi}$ exhibit the capability to detect the presence of $\alpha^*_{LR}=2$ in a $2$D square lattice clearly illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:detection}. Moreover, beyond this particular example we analyze the existence of transition point in distorted lattice geometries, with the distortion given by the angle $\Theta$ (Fig. \ref{fig:schematic3}). This transforms a square lattice to a hexagonal one smoothly, and gives the idea of dependence of transition point $\alpha^*_{LR}$ on lattice structure ($\Theta$). The weighted graph state on these lattices are defined as usual with each site being the vertex and weight is exponential of the Euclidean distance between the sides.
Let us extend the similar analysis of GME acquired by the weighted graph state obtained in two-dimensional lattices. As illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:schematic3}, we begin with a square lattice which is then deformed to other lattice structures with the deformation being given by an angle $\Theta$. Both $\bar{\mathcal{G}}_{2\pi}$ and $\frac{d\mathcal{G}_{2\pi}}{d\alpha}$ exhibit discontinuity at $\alpha_{LR}^*=2$, thereby showing their capability to detect the transition point present in a square lattice (see Fig. \ref{fig:detection_theta}).

Let us concentrate on the other deformed lattices and their transition points which, intuitively, depend on $\Theta$. While the similar behavior of GGM with time is observed in the weighted graph state on these distorted lattices, the transition point of decay rate $\alpha$ changes depending on $\Theta$ as evident from Fig. \ref{fig:detection_theta}. To make the study quantitatively, we introduce a quantity
\begin{eqnarray}
    \Delta\bar{ \mathcal{G}}_{2\pi}^{\Theta}=\bar{\mathcal{G}}(\alpha^*_{LR}+\delta,t)-\bar{\mathcal{G}}(\alpha^*_{LR}-\delta,t),
\end{eqnarray}
characterising the jump observed at $\alpha_{LR}^*$ for a small increment in \(\alpha_{LR}^*\), denoted as \(\delta\) (which we have taken as \(0.001\) for our investigations). As the distortion $\Theta$ is increased (from $90^\circ$, in the case of the square lattice), $\alpha_{LR}^*$ decreases from $2$ with the discontinuity ($\Delta\mathcal{\bar{G}}_{2\pi}$) being decreased. The trends continue with $\Theta$ till the lattice gets the honeycomb structure, i.e., $\Theta=120^\circ$, where $\mathcal{\bar{G}}_{2\pi}$ is continuous ($\Delta\mathcal{\bar{G}}_{2\pi}=0$) as shown in the inset, Fig. \ref{fig:detection_theta}(b). Specifically, $120^{\circ}>\Theta_1>\Theta_2>90^{\circ}$, we find $\Delta\mathcal{\bar{G}}_{2\pi}^{\Theta_1}<\Delta\mathcal{\bar{G}}_{2\pi}^{\Theta_2}$. The limiting case with $\Theta\to120^\circ$ corresponds to the $\alpha$ value ($\bar{\alpha}_{LR}$) where $\mathcal{\bar{G}}_{2\pi}=0$ continuously and changes its sign at $\alpha=\bar{\alpha}_{LR}$. Further, both $\alpha_{LR}^*$ and $\Delta\mathcal{\bar{G}}_{2\pi}$ starts increasing, when $\Theta>120^{\circ}$. The transition point, $\alpha_{LR}^*=2$, also emerges for the distorted $2$D lattice with $\Theta=135^\circ$, but with higher $\Delta\mathcal{\bar{G}}_{2\pi}$ than of $\Theta=90^\circ$. The inset (Fig. \ref{fig:detection_theta}(b)) shows $\Delta\mathcal{\bar{G}}_{2\pi}$ is of the order of $10^{-6}$, which abruptly vanishes for $\Theta=120^\circ$. Notice that  another discontinuity in $\mathcal{\bar{G}}_{2\pi}$ is observed near $\Theta=120^\circ$ which decreases as $\Theta$ is far away from $120^\circ$ and the reason behind such observation is not clear from our study. 

Summarizing the entire analysis establishes the dependence of $\alpha_{LR}^*$ on $\Theta$. In particular, $\alpha_{LR}^*$ decreases, when $90^{\circ}<\Theta<120^{\circ}$  while it again increases with $120^{\circ}<\Theta<135^{\circ}$ (see Fig. \ref{fig:alpha_theta}). Notice that $\alpha_{LR}^*$ shows a sudden change at $\Theta=120^{\circ}$, although $\mathcal{\bar{G}}_{2\pi}$ is smooth for honeycomb lattice, with the limiting value being $\bar{\alpha}_{LR}^*=\alpha_{LR}^*(\Theta\to120^\circ)=1.261\pm0.001$. 
It is worth noticing that when $135^{\circ}<\Theta<150^{\circ}$, \(\alpha_{LR}^*>2\) although beyond \(\Theta>150^{\circ}\), the unit chosen for NN sites is violated.   
Furthermore, studying the pattern of GME generated with variable-range interaction turns out to be an efficient method for detecting transition points in the fall-off rate.

\subsection{Replicating time-averaged GGM of an entire lattice with a smaller system size}
\label{sec:nsat}
%We have calculate the average GGM only for the integer value of $\alpha$. Which shows that for a particular integer value of $\alpha$ $(\alpha\geq 1)$, $\mathcal{Z}=\mathcal{N}-1$ give the best average GGM value.

%From now on we will concentrate only on the $1$D lattice. We successfully distinguish the long-range and quasi-local region around $\alpha=1$ boundary through the variation of $\frac{d\mathcal{G}}{dt}$ against $\alpha$. 
%In this section, our aim is to investigate the presence of a critical value concerning the total number of qubits, at which the multiparty entanglement, $\mathcal{G}$, exhibits a consistent behavior despite the further augmentation of qubit count.

%To achieve this objective let us define the average GGM $\langle G \rangle _{T}$ as the time-averaged value of GGM upto time $t=T$ as 
%\begin{eqnarray}
 %   \langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_T &=& \frac{\int_0^{T}\mathcal{G}(t)dt}{T}
%\end{eqnarray}
%In Fig. \ref{fig:avg_ggm} we show that the average value of GGM at $T=3\pi$, $\langle G \rangle_{T=3\pi}$ is decreasing drastically with increasing value of $\alpha$. The fall is extremely rapid in the LR and quasi-local region than the local region. For $\alpha\gtrsim 2$ the value of time-averaged GGM saturates to $\langle \mathcal{G}\rangle_{T=3\pi}\approx 0.18$. For $\alpha \to \infty$ which corresponds to nearest neighbor interaction we have $\langle \mathcal{G}\rangle_{T=3\pi}\approx 0.18$. As the interaction range is increased  by decreasing $\alpha$, $\langle \mathcal{G}\rangle_{T=3\pi}$ is increased significantly from $\alpha \sim 2$ and reaches maximum value $\langle \mathcal{G}\rangle_{T=3\pi}\approx 0.5$ for $\alpha \sim 0$ corresponding to all-to-all connection with equal weightage $r=1$. Thus we demonstrate the advantage of increasing the interaction range over NN interactions.

We now concentrate on the reduction of resource or the depth of the circuit. Specifically we wish to investigate the presence of a critical value concerning the total number of qubits at which the time-averaged multiparty entanglement saturates despite the further augmentation of qubit count. It can be achieved by minimizing the total number of qubits for all-connected weighted graph states with large number of qubits such that its time-averaged GGM  is emulated. To address this question mathematically, we define a saturation value in the total number of qubits, denoted as 
 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \nonumber \Delta\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle\equiv \text{min}_{N}| \langle\mathcal{G}(N+1,\alpha)\rangle_T - \langle\mathcal{G}(N,\alpha)\rangle_T |<\epsilon, \\
\end{eqnarray}
for an infinitesimal number $\epsilon$ and the corresponding $N$ represent $N_{sat}$. Here $\epsilon$ is fixed from the accuracy reached in the computation.

Let us illustrate that $N_{sat}$ also carries signature of transition point in $\alpha$. For examination, we fix  $\epsilon =10^{-2},10^{-3},5\times 10^{-3},10^{-4}$ with $T=3\pi$.
%% Figure environment removed
%In Fig. \ref{fig:Nsat-semilocal}  we plot the saturation value of the number of qubits $N_{sat}$ for quasi-local $(1<\alpha<2)$ and local $(\alpha>2)$ region respectively for different values of $\epsilon =10^{-2},10^{-3},5\times 10^{-3},10^{-4}$ with $T=3\pi$.
For $1<\alpha\lesssim 2$, the variation of $N_{sat}$ is extremely rapid which is not the case for $\alpha>>2$. For example, with $\epsilon=10^{-4}$ in the LR model with $\alpha=1$, we obtain $N_{sat}=4521$, which decreases drastically to $N_{sat}=29$ for $\alpha = 2$. It declines further with the increase of $\alpha$ and $N_{sat}|_{\alpha = 3}=9$ and  $N_{sat}|_{\alpha = 5}=5$ in the local regime. Therefore, $N_{sat}$ becomes single-digit when only short-range interactions are involved in the evolving Hamiltonian while it is moderate in the quasi-local regime and posses a very high value in the LR system.

With the decrease of $\epsilon$, the saturation value $N_{sat}$ grows rapidly in the region $1\lesssim\alpha\lesssim 2$, although beyond this region, the rate of increase is much low, i.e., the value of $N_{sat}$ remains unaltered as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Nsat-semilocal} for $\alpha\gtrsim2$. Let us ask the question -- ``What is the minimum number of qubits required so that the time-averaged GGM, $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_{T=3\pi}$  saturates for a given $\alpha$?" As shown in Fig.  \ref{fig:avg_ggm},  with the model having $N=10^6$ sites, $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_{T=3\pi}=0.331971$ at $\alpha=1.5$. By careful analysis, we find that with $\epsilon=10^{-4}$ and with $ N_{sat}=117$ which is the moderate number of qubits, achievable even with current technologies, we can obtain $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_{T=3\pi}=0.331961$. However, in the presence of long range interactions,  the error has a drastic effect on $\Delta\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle$ and it is nearly impossible to find $N_{sat}<<N$ in this domain.

%whereas below that it is rapidly varying. It is quite an impossible task to find $N_{sat}$ value in long range region that is $\alpha\lesssim 1$ for a significant error $\epsilon<0.001$. For example one can check that for a particular value $\alpha=0.9$ if we decrease our error from $0.01$ to $0.001$ the $N_{sat}$ value change from $83$ to $1438$.

%Furthermore, we show that according to the accuracy required we can reduce the number of qubits with all-to-all connection when the genuine multipartite entanglement content and $\alpha$ is given. As an illustration we find $\langle \mathcal{G} \rangle_{T=3\pi}=0.331971$ at $\alpha = 1.5$ as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:avg_ggm} for $N=10^6$ number of qubits which can be mimicked  by lower number of qubits as evident from Fig. \ref{fig:Nsat-semilocal}. The end-to-end connected $N=N_{sat}=117$-qubit state contain $\langle \mathcal{G}\rangle_{T=3\pi}=0.331961$ with $\epsilon=10^{-4}$.




\section{Mimicking  GGM from long-range with short-range model}
\label{sec:mimick}
% In the  plot we can see that there is different saturation value of the no of qubit $\mathcal{N}$ for different value of $\alpha$. Actually the saturation point is decrasing with increasing value of $\alpha$. \\
The emergence of exquisite traits in LR models that are often missing in few body interactive systems has attracted lots of interests. Apart from the physical systems like trapped ions in which long range model arises naturally \cite{HAFFNER2008155}, there exist other physical systems including superconducting circuits where one requires two-qubit gates to generate interactions between distant sites \cite{ying23, PRXQuantumsuper}. With the increase of range of interaction, the number of two-qubit gates increases and hence the decoherence effects become prominent. Without compromising the production of GME, our objective is to decrease the range of interactions, i.e., $z$, which can mimic the entanglement properties of LR.
%\ph{Due to the presence of some specific tools, many aspects of various SR models, both in the case of a finite size system and the thermodynamic limit, may be analytically computed which is impossible for LR models. Although recently due to PEPS, MPS, tensor network formalism,  the LR models can also be tracked efficiently \cite{koffel2012,coffman2000,scha2013,Buyskikh2016,tommaso2017,zhu2018,osborne2006,Dhar2017,vodola2014}. In the realm of quantum networks which require long-range  interactions between nodes in order to carry out information processing tasks, the necessity of LR many-body systems becomes readily apparent. However, the implementation of these interactions poses considerable challenges, as it necessitates a staggering number of two-qubit gates of the order of $O(N!)$, thereby introducing substantial noise into the system. The inquiry naturally arises as to whether it is feasible to achieve certain attributes of LR models with a reduced number of finite interactions, consequently, a lesser quantity of two-qubit gates. Such a reduction would have the benefit of mitigating noise and facilitating computational tasks.}
%\ph{Apply this para into introduction.}
Specifically, for a fixed value of $N$,  we ask "what is the minimum coordination number required to produce GGM that can be obtained with fully connected model?" We study the trade off between genuine multiparty entanglement content of a fully connected model and the same created by evolving Hamiltonian with the finite range of interactions. 

Let us define the minimum coordination number. For a fixed $N$, and $\alpha$, if the difference of the time-averaged GGM with the variation of $z$ remains constant, we call the minimum $z$ in which $\langle \mathcal{G}\rangle$ saturates as $z_c$. Mathematically, we compute 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \Tilde{\Delta}\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_{z_c} \equiv \min_{z}| \langle\mathcal{G}(z=N-1)\rangle_T - \langle\mathcal{G}(z)\rangle_T|<\epsilon.
    \label{eq_zc}
\end{eqnarray}
with $\epsilon$ being the infinitesimal number which leads to $z_c$. Like in the previous case for all values of $\alpha$, we set $T=3\pi$, $\epsilon\approx10^-3$ in the quasi-local and local regions. In the quasi-local and local regions, we observe that it is indeed possible to find $z_c$, i.e., there exist $z_c$ for a fixed $\alpha$ and $N$, above which $\langle \mathcal{G}\rangle_{T}$ is constant. For example, with $\alpha=1.82$, and $N=120$, the time-averaged GGM obtained with LR model ($z=N-1$) can be attained with $z_c=41$. For different $\alpha<2$ values, such $z_c$ emerges for a fixed $N$ from $\langle \mathcal{G}\rangle_{3\pi}$ as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:Z_critical}. Furthermore, the variation of $z_c$ with $\alpha$ can determine the critical point, $\alpha_{SR}^*$. Specifically, in the local regime, $z_c$ remains almost unaltered with $\alpha$ while its increase is drastic when $1\lesssim\alpha\lesssim 2$ (comparing Figs. \ref{fig:Nsat-semilocal}(a) and \ref{fig:Nsat-semilocal}(b)).


%We see that long-range $\mathcal{G}$ is mimicked by finite range connectivity $z$. For example, with $\alpha=1.82$ and $N=120$ qubits which are all-to-all connected, i.e., $z=N-1$, the behavior of $\langle \mathcal{G}\rangle_{T=3\pi}$ can be mimicked by $z=41$.

%Notice that $N_{sat}=44$ corresponding to $\alpha=1.46$ in Fig. \ref{fig:GGM-Nsat}(a) with all-to-all connection have $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_{3\pi}=\frac{3.18717}{3\pi}=0.338169$ although to evaluate $z_c$ we observe that for $N=44$ with $z_c=31$ we have $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_{3\pi}=\frac{3.18627}{3\pi}=0.338074$. However, $\langle G \rangle_{3\pi}$ keeps on increasing with increasing $N$ and connectivity $z$ until $N=125$ alongwith $z_c=41$ when it matches with $\langle\mathcal{G}\rangle_{3\pi}=\frac{3.18717}{3\pi}=0.338169$. This difference is due to the two error windows we are allowing in calculating both $N_{sat}$ and $z_c$. Although this error is vanishingly small with increasing $\alpha$.

%As a result, we demonstrate that the GGM of a long-range multiqubit state with a large number of parties can be replicated with lower connectivity and a smaller number of parties. 


% Now we can show that this kind of WGS obey the universality class depending on the value of the $\alpha$. There is a phase transition at $\alpha=1$ and $\alpha=2$. The region, $\alpha<1$ is called long-range region, $1<\alpha<2$ is called semi-local, and $\alpha>2$ is called local region.\\

\section{ Strategy of disconnecting subgraphs in WGS}
%Measurement in weighted graph state}
\label{sec:measurement_effect}
Let us now move our attention to the effects of single qubit projective measurement on the weighted graph states, thereby disconnecting the part from the entire lattice that is not required for information processing tasks. At the same time, one of our objectives is to design the measurement strategy in such a way that the remaining unmeasured parties share the WGS. Such scheme diminish the qubit count from $N$ to $(N-m)$ while preserving an $(N-m)$-qubit WGS, all the while maintaining the original inter-qubit separation. Fig. \ref{fig:local_measurement} illustrates the schematic diagram  to achieve the same for $N=5$ and $m=3$ on which the local measurement operators act. Notice that the strategy presented below is valid for both 1D and 2D lattices. 

%We further investigate the impact of these local measurements on the multipartite entanglement content.

{\bf Towards qubit number reduction in WGS.} Let us perform a single-qubit projective measurement, $\{M_k^{j}|j=1,2\}$ on the qubit $k$ of the $N$-qubit WGS. Therefore, when the outcome $j$ occurs, the normalised  output state after tracing out the $k$th qubit can be presented as 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \nonumber &&\ket{\Psi(t)}_{N-1\{12\ldots {(k-1)} {(k+1)}\ldots N \}}^{j_k} \\ &&=\frac{M_k^{j}\ket{\Psi(t)}_{N\{1\ldots N\}}}{\sqrt{_{N\{1\ldots N\}}\bra{\Psi(t)}M_k^{j}\ket{\Psi(t)}_{N\{1\ldots N\}}}}.
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{theorem}
    Single qubit measurements in $\sigma_z$ basis on $m$ number of qubits situated in arbitrary position on all-to-all connected $N$-qubit weighted graph state provide local unitarily equivalent $(N-m)$-qubit weighted graph state with modified weights where initial qubit position remains fixed.
    \label{th:2}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let us rewrite an $N$-qubit weighted graph state in Eq. (\ref{eq:wgs}), following the power law as
\begin{eqnarray}
   \nonumber &&\ket{G(t)}_{N\{1,2,\ldots,k,\ldots,N\}} \\
   &&=\frac{1}{2^{N/2}}\sum_{\eta=0}^{2^N-1}\exp\Big(-i\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j>i}^{N} g_{i j}(t)\delta_{a_i}^1\delta_{a_j}^1\Big)\ket{\eta},
\end{eqnarray}
which consists of all possible states in the computational basis of $N$ qubits with $\ket{\eta}$ being the decimal equivalent of binary values. Performing measurement in  the $\sigma_z$ basis on the $k$th qubit and selecting the outcome $M^0_k=\ket{0}_k\bra{0}$, the output state takes the form as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \nonumber &&\ket{G(t)}_{N\{1,2,\ldots,k,\ldots,N\}}^{0_k} \\ \nonumber
    &&=\frac{1}{2^{N/2}}\sum_{\substack{r=2\mathbb{Z}\\r<2^k}}\sum_{\eta=r2^{N-k}}^{(1+r)2^{N-k}-1}\exp\Big(-i\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j>i}^{N} g_{i j}(t)\delta_{a_i}^1\delta_{a_j}^1\Big)\ket{\eta}.\\
\end{eqnarray}
Tracing out the $k$th qubit reduces the binary value of each basis to $(\eta'-r2^{N-k})\forall r$ by which we write the corresponding state as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \nonumber &&\ket{G(t)}_{(N-1)\{1,2,\ldots,k-1,k+1,\ldots,N\}}^{0_k} \\ \nonumber
    &&=\frac{1}{2^{(N-1)/2}}\sum_{\substack{r=2\mathbb{Z}\\r<2^k}}\sum_{\eta=r2^{N-k}}^{(1+r)2^{N-k}-1}\exp\Big(-i\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j>i}^{N} g_{i j}(t)\delta_{a_i}^1\delta_{a_j}^1\Big)\\ \nonumber &&\ket{\eta-r2^{N-k}}.\\
    \label{eq:eta-r2nk}
\end{eqnarray}
Eventually for each possible value of $\eta$ and $r<2^k$, all possible terms in Eq. (\ref{eq:eta-r2nk}) forms a basis of $(N-1)$-qubit WGS state. Therefore, we can write 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \nonumber &&\ket{G(t)}_{(N-1)\{1,2,\ldots,k-1,k+1,\ldots,N\}}^{0_k} \\ \nonumber&&=\frac{1}{2^{(N-1)/2}}\sum_{\zeta=0}^{2^{N-1}-1}\exp\Big(-i\sum_{\substack{i=1\\i\neq k}}^{N-1}\sum_{\substack{j>i\\j\neq k}}^{N} g_{i j}(t)\delta_{a_i}^1\delta_{a_j}^1\Big)\ket{\zeta}\\ \nonumber &&=\prod_{\substack{i=1\\i\neq k}}^{N-1} \prod_{\substack{j>i\\j\neq k}}^{N}U_{ij} \ket{+}_1\ket{+}_2\otimes\ldots\otimes\ket{+}_{k-1}\ket{+}_{k+1}\otimes\ldots\otimes\ket{+}_N \\ \nonumber &&=\ket{{G}(t)}_{(N-1)\{1,2,\ldots,k-1,k+1,\ldots,N\}},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\ket{\zeta}\equiv\ket{a_1 a_2 \ldots a_{k-1} a_{k+1}\ldots a_N}$. Similarly, measuring and tracing out site $l$ on $(N-1)$-qubit WGS state in the computational basis leads to $(N-2)$-qubit WGS state when the outcome is $M_l^0$ and so on. After $m$ number of such measurements, we obtain $(N-m)$-qubit WGS state, when $M^0$ clicks in all the $m$ sites. Specifically, measuring on $k_1,\ldots,k_m$ sites, the resulting state is $(N-m)$-qubit WGS, denoted as $\ket{{G}(t)}^{0_{k_1}\ldots 0_{k_m}}_{(N-m)\{k\}_{k=1;k\neq k_1,\ldots, k_m }^N}\equiv\ket{{G}(t)}_{(N-m)\{k\}_{k=1;k\neq k_1,\ldots, k_m }^N}$. The single-site density matrix corresponding to the site $l$ as
%of $\ket{G(t)}_{(N-1)\{1,2,\ldots,k-1,k+1,\ldots,l,\ldots,N\}}^{0_k}$, the $M_l^0$ outcome state is $\ket{G(t)}_{(N-2)\{1,2,\ldots,k-1,k+1,\ldots,l-1,l+1,\ldots,N\}}^{0_k0_l}$ and so on. Therefore, initially starting from $\ket{G(t)}_{N\{k\}_{k=1}^N}$ and measuring on $m$ number of qubits and selecting $\ket{0}\bra{0}$ outcome in all measurements we get $\ket{G(t)}^{0_{k_1}\ldots 0_{k_m}}_{(N-m)\{k\}_{k=1;k\neq k_1,\ldots, k_m }^N}$ which is exactly the state of $(N-m)$ qubits of  $N$-party state where except $k_1,\ldots,k_m$ qubits all the qubits are connected to each other, i.e., have the following state $\ket{{G}(t)}_{(N-m)\{k\}_{k=1;k\neq k_1,\ldots, k_m }^N}$ having single site density matrix corresponding to $l$th site as
\begin{eqnarray}
   \rho_l^0(k_1,\ldots,k_m) &=&\begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{1}{2} & x\\
    x^* & \frac{1}{2}
  \end{pmatrix} \equiv \rho_l,
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
    x=\frac{1}{2^{N-m}}\prod_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq l, k_1,\ldots,k_m}}^N(1+e^{i \phi_{lj}}),
\end{eqnarray}
and $\rho_l^0(k_1,\ldots,k_m)$ denotes the $l$th side density matrix with the measurement outcome on $k_1,\ldots,k_m$ qubits being $M^0$.

Let us consider the situation when $M^1$ clicks. The single-site density matrix changes to $\rho_l^1(k_1,\ldots,k_m)$ with different off diagonal entries modified by a phase factor as
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \rho_l^1(k_1,\ldots,k_m)=\begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{1}{2} & y\\
    y^* & \frac{1}{2}
  \end{pmatrix},
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
    y=\frac{1}{2^{N-m}}e^{i\sum_{r=1}^m \phi_{lk_r}}\prod_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq l, k_1,\ldots,k_m}}^N(1+e^{i \phi_{lj}}).
\end{eqnarray}
The eigenvalues of $\rho_l^1(k_1,\ldots,k_m)$ and $\rho_l^0(k_1,\ldots,k_m)\equiv\rho_l$ are same due to fact that off diagonal entries differ only by a phase factor. Therefore, the output state obtained with the outcome $M^1$ is local unitarily connected with the state having $M^0$ outcome. Here the local unitary at each site is given by 
%$\ket{G(t)}^{1_{k_1},\ldots,1_{k_m}}_{(N-m)\{k\}_{k=1;k\neq k_1,\ldots, k_m }^N}$ is local unitarily connected to $\ket{G(t)}^{0_{k_1},\ldots,0_{k_m}}_{(N-m)\{k\}_{k=1;k\neq k_1,\ldots, k_m }^N}$ where local unitary at each site has the following form
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mathbb{U}_l=\begin{pmatrix}
    e^{i\sum_{r=1}^m \phi_{lk_r}} & 0 \\
    0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix},
\end{eqnarray}
i.e., 
\begin{eqnarray}
   \nonumber &&\ket{G(t)}^{0_{k_1},\ldots,0_{k_m}}_{(N-m)\{k\}_{k=1;k\neq k_1,\ldots, k_m }^N}\\&&= \bigotimes_{l\in k}\mathbb{U}_l\ket{G(t)}^{1_{k_1},\ldots,1_{k_m}}_{(N-m)\{k\}_{k=1;k\neq k_1,\ldots, k_m }^N}.
\end{eqnarray} 
Notice that $\mathbb{U}_l \in SU(2)$, in general, although for some particular values of $\sum_{r=1}^m \phi_{lk_r}=2n\pi,(4n+3)\frac{\pi}{2},(4n+1)\frac{\pi}{2}$, the local unitary $\mathbb{U}_l$ becomes Clifford unitary \cite{nielsen_chuang_2010} as it preserves the single-qubit Pauli group. Finally, it is clear that for total $m$ number of measurements on arbitrary  qubits, $k_1,\ldots,k_m$, we have to apply local unitary on each qubits depending on the outcome at every step of the measurement  except $k_1,\ldots,k_m$, i.e., 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \nonumber &&\ket{G(t)}_{(N-m)\{k\}_{k=1;k\neq k_1,\ldots, k_m }^N}\\ \nonumber&&= \prod_{j=1}^{m}\bigg(\bigotimes_{\substack{l_j=1 \\ l_j\neq k_1,\ldots, k_m}}^N(\delta_{a_{k_j}}^0 \mathbb{I_{l_j}}+\delta_{a_{k_j}}^1\mathbb{U}_{l_j})\bigg)\ket{G(t)}^{a_{k_1},\ldots,a_{k_m}}_{(N-m)\{k\}_{k=1;k\neq k_1,\ldots, k_m }^N}.\\
\end{eqnarray}
\end{proof}
%Here, the presence of an arrow above the products indicate that the operators are to be applied to the products in a sequential manner, moving from left to right, $\prod_{j=1}^{\overleftarrow{m}}X_j=X_m X_{m-1}\ldots X_2 X_1$.

Let us illustrate Theorem \ref{th:2} with an example. For $N=3$, after measuring and tracing out the $2$nd qubit, the output state becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
    \ket{G(t)}_{2\{1 3\}}^{0_2} =\frac{1}{2}(\ket{00}+\ket{01}+\ket{10}+e^{-i g_{1 3}}\ket{11}),
    \label{eq:3qubit_0}
\end{eqnarray}
when $\ket{0}$ clicks which  is equivalent to $\ket{G(t)}_{2\{1 3\}} = U_{1 3}\ket{+}_{1}\ket{+}_{3}$ where the qubits at position $1$ and $3$ are connected. The output state of the outcome, $M^1=\ket{1}\bra{1}$ can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \nonumber \ket{G(t)}_{2\{13\}}^{1_2}&=&\frac{1}{2}(\ket{00}+e^{-ig_{23}}\ket{01}+e^{-ig_{12}}\ket{10}\\ &+&e^{-i(g_{12}+g_{13}+g_{23})}\ket{11}),
\end{eqnarray}
which is equivalent to $\ket{G(t)}_{2\{13\}}$ upto local unitary, $\mathbb{U}_1\otimes \mathbb{U}_3 = \text{diag}(e^{i\phi_{21}},1)_1\otimes \text{diag}(e^{i\phi_{23}},1)_3   $. Similarly, starting from $\ket{G(t)}_{5\{12345\}}$, we can generate $\ket{G(t)}_{4\{1345\}}$, $\ket{G(t)}_{3\{135\}}$ and $\ket{G(t)}_{2\{13\}}$ successively by measuring $\sigma_z$ on the second, fourth and fifth qubits respectively as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:local_measurement}.


% {\bf Impact of local measurement on multiparty entanglement.} Let us now investigate the genuine multipartite entanglement content (quantified by GGM, $\mathcal{G}$) of the measured states which can be useful for different computational tasks. The $\mathcal{G}$ of the $N$ party all-to-all connected reaches its maximum value of $\mathcal{G}=0.5$ at time $t=\pi$. Therefore, we fix the time at $t=\pi$ and analyze the Genuine entanglement content with increasing the number of local measurements on the qubits.

% Measuring in the $\sigma_z$ basis in the $1$st or (and) $N$th qubit of the $N$-qubit state generates an $N-1 (N-2)$-qubit weighted graph state where all the nearest neighbor lattice sides are filled up having $\mathcal{G}=0.5$.



% Now we move our position of measurement on the $2$nd qubit in both $\sigma_z$ basis and along the optimized direction such that the resulting $(N-1)$-party state generates maximum $\mathcal{G}$ at $t=\pi$. In Fig. \ref{fig:GGM_N_meas_2} we plot the average $\mathcal{G}_{\text{avg}}=\sum_{i=0}^1p_i\mathcal{G}_i$ of the $(N-1)$-party state for different $N$ for both $\sigma_z$ basis and the optimized basis. We show that $\mathcal{G}_{\max}=0.43$ is invariant with $N$ if we choose the optimized basis although in case of $\sigma_z$ basis $\mathcal{G}$ increases with increasing number of qubits $N$.

% We now increase the number of measurements to two, i.e., alongwith the $2$nd qubit we perform the $2$nd measurement in different qubit positions $r=3,4,\ldots$. In Fig. \ref{fig:GGM_N_meas_2_r} for $N=10$ we plot $\mathcal{G}_{\text{avg}}=\sum_i p_i \mathcal{G}_i$ for the same which shows an increasing behavior starting from $\mathcal{G}_{\text{avg}}=0.155$ for $r=3$ to $\mathcal{G}_{\text{avg}}=0.25$ for $r=9$. Therefore, as the distance between the two measurements are increasing the average value of GGM also increases.

%  % We are able to write the generalized $N$ party  weighted cluster state. Now we will shift our attention to make  weighted cluster state of size $(N-r)$ from $N$ party state. For this we are considering the fully connected weighted cluster state. More specifically the weight is such that $\alpha=1$ (that is algebraic decay in the weight). The protocol is as follows:

%  % \subsubsection{Measurement strategy for open chain}
 
%  % \begin{itemize}
%  %     \item Prepare the state as $\ket{\psi(t=0)}=\ket{+}^{\otimes N}$.
%  %     \item Now entangled the state with the help of the unitary stated above.
%  %     \item Measure in the basis $\ket{0}, \ket{1}$ 
%  %     in  the last or first qubit
%  %     \item Consider the ouput state of $\ket{0}$
   
%  % \end{itemize}
 

 
%  \subsection*{Situation for periodic boundary}

% \ph{Due to the similarity of Hamiltonian $H_{ij}$ in interchange of its index $i$, $j$ measurement procedure in periodic boundary  is less complex than open boundary condition. It is possible to generate a fully connect $(N-1)$-party WGS, from a $N$-party WGS, with the help of projective measurement in $\sigma_z$ basis in any single qubit of that $N$-party WGS. Both the states has GGM $\mathcal{G}=0.5$ at $t=\pi$.}

% %So by successive measurement on the respective qubit at the corner we can come to (any) desire system of size $\Tilde{N}<<N$.

% % \subsubsection{Single measurement strategy for the qubit except edge}
% % \begin{itemize}
% %      \item Prepare the state as $\ket{\psi(t=0)}=\ket{+}^{\otimes N}$.
% %      \item Now entangled the state with the help of the unitary stated above.
% %      \item Measure in the basis $\ket{0}, \ket{1}$ 
% %      in  any qubit except 2nd and $(N-1)$th qubit.
% %      \item Consider the ouput state of $\ket{0}$
% %  \end{itemize}
% % Now for this situation the output state will also be a $(N-1)$ party  weighted graph state, which has maximum GGM, but this $(N-1)$ party state is not same what we are getting after the measurement at the edge that the weights are not consistent what we have considered. We can say this is a weighted graph state with the random weight.

% % \subsubsection{Measurement  for 2nd or $(N-1)$th qubit }
% % For any $N$ party weighted cluster state we can come to the $N-1$ party weighted graph state (whether the weight is random or consistent  what we have considered) but this is no more valid for the situation when we are measuring in the 2nd or $(N-1)$th qubit with the measurement basis $\ket{0}, \ket{1}$. Though the output state is not that much close to the maximally entangled, we can less the gap between the output state and a maximally entangled state by optimizing over our measurement basis.



% % We can see the average GGM is 0.43 if choose the optimize measurement basis.

% % \subsubsection{More than single measurement strategy for the qubit except edge}


% % The GGM is increasing with the position of the qubit.



\section{Conclusion}
	\label{sec:conclu}
 
Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a promising candidate to implement quantum circuits in laboratories and hence it is crucial to identify the ingredient, known as cluster state, which belongs to the set of stabilizer states required for performing MBQC perfectly. They are typically produced by using the nearest-neighbor Ising Hamiltonian from a product state. Instead of nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions, if the product state is evolved with variable-range interactions, weighted graph states possessing exquisite characteristics can be produced, exhibiting some features of the evolving Hamiltonian that NN interactions cannot reveal. We argued the exact expression of generalized geometric measure (GGM) as a function of fall-off rate, range of interactions and time for any system size, in both one- and two-dimensions with varied geometries.
It is worth noting that producing GGM for an arbitrary number of sites is computationally demanding since it necessitates calculating the maximum eigenvalues of all possible reduced density matrices and hence with the increase of system size, the computational complexity grows exponentially.
 In this case, we proved that the maximum eigenvalue obtained only from the single-site reduced density matrix contributes to the GGM.
 We demonstrated that the time-derivative of GGM in one- and two-dimensions, including lattices formed after deformation from square one, can identify transitions in fall-off rates from long-range to quasi-local regions. On the other hand, we found that the saturation of time-averaged GGM  with system size as well as fall-off rates can be employed to predict transitions from quasi-local to local regimes in the evolving Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we observed that, for a certain system size, GGM generated from a finite-range Hamiltonian resembles the behavior of GGM in the long-range models under the quasi-local and local regimes.



 
    % The weighted graph states are non-Clifford states which have exquisite properties, typically absent in the Clifford states. They show richer entanglement behavior based on the weight distribution of the graph and can be used to prepare states which can have high multipartite entanglement for longer times.

    % We used the multipartite entanglement of the weighted graph state as a detector of the long range Ising model in both one- and two-dimensions with various geometries. We had shown that the genuine multipartite entanglement (GGM) succesfully captures the difference between the non-local and quasi-local behavior of the long range models, both for one dimensional chains and the square lattices. We used this detector to distorted two-dimensional lattices, and propose transition in decay rate in these lattices. We find that honeycomb lattice does not show the transition between non-local and quasi-local regimes. For one dimensional chains we show that non-local and quasi-local regimes can be determined by whether the system can reach a limit where the multipartite entanglement dynamics of a large system are essentially the same for a smaller system. In the non-local regime, such a limit is not achieved whereas in quasi-local and local regimes, such a limit achieved with smaller systems for large decay rate effectively describing the dynamical entanglement of the large system. In the quasi-local and local regimes, the smaller system have the properties of a finite range Hamiltonian, with the same entanglement profile.

    We also investigated the effect of measurement along a certain direction on the weighted graph state. We showed that the resultant weighted graph state is local unitarily equivalent to another weighted graph state with fewer qubits, and obtained the relationship between the weights of the pre- and the post-measured states. 
   The present findings demonstrate the potential of WGS as a resource for quantum communication and computation taks. 
    
    %Our analysis builds up on the use of the weighted graph states as a resource for measurement-based quantum computation.

\section{Calculation of reduced density matrices of WGS form PEPS description}
\label{sec:WGS_PEPS}
Going to the PEPS description \cite{verstraete_pra_2004, dur_hartmann_prl_2005, hartmann_briegel_2007} of $\ket{\Psi^\prime}$ in Eq. (\ref{eq:psi_reduced}) based on $G^\prime$, each qubit in $B$ is replaced by $n$ virtual qubits (one for each site in $A$), and similarly, each qubit in $A$ is replaced by $N-n$ virtual qubits (one for each site in $B$). The  $\ket{\Psi^\prime}$ in terms of the virtual qubits can be represented as
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\bar{\Psi}^\prime}=\bigotimes_{k\in A,l\in B}U_{k,l}\ket{+}_{\bar{k}_l}\ket{+}_{\bar{l}_k}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Action of projection on virtual qubits in $B$}
For simplicity, consider $N=3$ with $A=\{1,2\}$ and $B=\{3\}$. Denoting the virtual qubits of $1$ as $\bar{1}_3$, of $2$ as $\bar{2}_3$ and of $3$ as $\bar{3}_1$ and $\bar{3}_2$, in the PEPS form, the state is
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \ket{\bar{\Psi}^\prime}_{N=3} &=&\left(U_{13}\ket{+}_{\bar{1}_3}\ket{+}_{\bar{3}_1}\right) \left(U_{23}\ket{+}_{\bar{2}_3}\ket{+}_{\bar{3}_2}\right)\\
    &=&\ket{+}_{\bar{1}_3}\ket{+}_{\bar{2}_3}\ket{0}_{\bar{3}_1}\ket{0}_{\bar{3}_2} + \ket{\zeta_1}_{\bar{1}_3}\ket{\zeta_2}_{\bar{2}_3}\ket{1}_{\bar{3}_1}\ket{1}_{\bar{3}_2} + \dots
\end{eqnarray*}
with $\ket{\zeta_k}_{\bar{k}_3}=(\ket{0}_{\bar{k}_3}+e^{-ig_{k3}}\ket{1}_{\bar{k}_3})/\sqrt{2}$ for $k=1,2$ and only the terms surviving in the projections are shown after the action of unitaries. After projection from virtual to physical qubit in position $3$, we get
\begin{eqnarray*}
    P_3\ket{\bar{\Psi}^\prime}_{N=3} &=&\Big(\ket{0_3}\bra{0_{\bar{3}_1}0_{\bar{3}_2}}+\ket{1_3}\bra{1_{\bar{3}_1}1_{\bar{3}_2}}\Big)\ket{\bar{\Psi}^\prime}_{N=3}\\
    &=&\ket{++}_{\bar{1}_3\bar{2}_3}\ket{0}_3 + \ket{\zeta_1\zeta_2}_{\bar{1}_3\bar{2}_3}\ket{1}_3\\
    &=&U_{13}U_{23}\ket{+}_{\bar{1}_3}\ket{+}_{\bar{2}_3}\ket{+}_3,
\end{eqnarray*}
which is not normalized. Therefore, for $N$-qubit state, the action of projections $P_l$
% =\ket{0_l}\bra{0_{l_1}0_{l_2}\dots0_{l_n}}+\ket{1_l}\bra{1_{l_1}1_{l_2}\dots1_{l_n}}
on qubits in B gives a state (upto normalization) of the form $\ket{\Psi^P}=\bigotimes\limits_{l\in B}^{}\left[\prod_{k\in A}U_{kl} \ket{+}_{\bar{k}_l}\ket{+}_l\right]$ that is a tensor product of $N-n$ states. This allows us to individually trace out each qubit in B.

\subsection{Partial trace over $B$}
Let us consider again $N=3$ case with $A=\{1\}$ (virtual qubits $\bar{1}_2, \bar{1}_3$) and $B=\{2,3\}$. Then from the previous discussion, $\ket{\Psi^P}=\Big(U_{12}\ket{+}_{\bar{1}_2}\ket{+}_2\Big)\bigotimes\Big(U_{13}\ket{+}_{\bar{1}_3}\ket{+}_3\Big)$ and the partial trace over $\{2,3\}$ can be done independently, by which we obtain $\bar{\rho}_1=\bar{\rho}_1(2)\bigotimes\bar{\rho}_1(3)$, where $\bar{\rho}_1(l)=\ket{+}_{\bar{1}_l}\bra{+}+\ket{\zeta_l}_{\bar{1}_l}\bra{\zeta_l}$, with $\ket{\zeta_l}_{\bar{1}_l}=(\ket{0}_{\bar{1}_l}+e^{-ig_{1l}}\ket{1}_{\bar{1}_l})/\sqrt{2}$ for $l=1,2$.

It is important to note that although not normalized, each $\bar{\rho}_1(l)$ is a positive semi-definite matrix with all diagonal values as $1$. Generalizing this effect to $N$-qubit WGS, with bipartition $A$ of $n$ sites, the reduced density matrix is
\begin{equation}
     \bar{\rho}_A = \bigotimes_{l\in B}\bar{\rho}_A(l) = \bigotimes_{l\in B}2^{n-1}\Big( \ket{+}_{\bar{1}_l\bar{2}_l\dots\bar{n}_l}\bra{+}+\ket{\zeta_l}_{\bar{1}_l\bar{2}_l\dots\bar{n}_l}\bra{\zeta_l}\Big),
     \label{eq:rho_l}
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\zeta_l}_{\bar{1}_l\bar{2}_l\dots\bar{n}_l}=(\ket{0}_{\bar{1}_l\bar{2}_l\dots\bar{n}_l}+\left(\prod\limits_{k\in A}^{}e^{-ig_{kl}}\right)\ket{1}_{\bar{1}_l\bar{2}_l\dots\bar{n}_l})/\sqrt{2}$ for $l\in B$ and each $\bar{\rho}_A(l)$ is a $2^n\times2^n$ positive semi-definite matrix, scaled by $2^{n-1}$ so that all the diagonal values of each $\bar{\rho}_A(l)$ is unity. Note that the weights are encoded in the off-diagonal terms as phases. Proper normalization of $\bar{\rho}_A$ is done only at the end after the projection on virtual qubits in $A$.

\subsection{Action of projection on virtual qubits in $A$}
For the above case of $N=3$ with $A=\{1\}$ (virtual qubits $\bar{1}_2, \bar{1}_3$) and $B=\{2,3\}$,  $\bar{\rho}_1(l)=\ket{0}_{\bar{1}_l}\bra{0}+x_{1l}\ket{1}_{\bar{1}_l}\bra{0}+x^*_{1l}\ket{0}_{\bar{1}_l}\bra{1}+\ket{1}_{\bar{1}_l}\bra{1}$, where $x_{1l}=\frac{1+e^{-ig_{1l}}}{2}$ for $l=2,3$. From the form of the inevitable projection $P_k$ for $k\in A$, the only terms in the tensor product of virtual qubits that will contribute are ones formed only via $\ket{00}_{\bar{1}_2\bar{1}_3}, \ket{11}_{\bar{1}_2\bar{1}_3}$ and their dual vectors. After applying $P_k$, we finally get
\begin{equation}
    \rho^\prime_1=
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1                & x_{12}x_{13}\\
        x^*_{12}x^*_{13} & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
    = \bar{\rho}(2)\ostar\bar{\rho}(3),
\end{equation}
where $\ostar$ is the Hadamard product. This can be generalized for $A$ with $n$ sites, as $\rho^\prime_A=\underset{l\in B}{\ostar}\bar{\rho}_A(l)$, where $\bar{\rho}_A(l)$ is represented as in Eq. (\ref{eq:rho_l}) scaled all diagonal entries to unity.




\end{document}




\subsection{Introduce Hamiltonian}
We introduce the Hamiltonian of $\mathcal{N}$ spin-1/2 qubits here with, not only the nearest-neighbor interaction, all possible interaction. Also this long range Hamiltonian has different interaction strength between different lattice site which make this model very realistic rather than equal weight for every interaction. We are dealing with the situation where the coupling strength between two spins follow certain kinds of distance law (basically power law decay) which make the model more realistic. So this long range fully connected weighted Hamiltonian is of the form
\begin{eqnarray}
     H &=& \sum_{k=1}^{\mathcal{N}-1}\sum_{l>k}^\mathcal{N} g(k,l)\Big(\frac{1-\sigma_z^{(k)}}{2}\Big)\Big(\frac{1-\sigma_z^{(l)}}{2}\Big) \nonumber \\
     & = &  \sum_{k=1}^{\mathcal{N}-1}\sum_{l>k}^\mathcal{N} H_{kl}
     \label{eq:Hmain}
\end{eqnarray}

   The coupling strength $g(k,l,t)$ can be time dependent or time independent. We take this to be time independent as $g(k,l,t)=g(k,l)$. And also it is only depends on the the distance between two spins $r_{kl}$ as $g(k,l)=g(r_{kl})$. So the arbitrary distance dependence(coupling strength) is

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For periodic boundary 
    \begin{eqnarray}
   g(k,l)&=&[\text{min}(r_{kl},N-r_{kl})]^{-\alpha}
    \end{eqnarray}
    \item For open boundary 
    \begin{eqnarray}
    g(k,l)&=&r_{kl}^{-\alpha}
    \end{eqnarray}
\end{enumerate}
for $r_{kl}=|k-l|$. The parameter $\alpha$ has some physical significance. Depending on $\alpha$ the nature of the Hamiltonian can change. For large value of $\alpha$ this long range Hamiltonian convert into the Nearest neighbor Ising type Hamiltonian.








%\subsection{Properties other than GGM}

\subsection{$\mathcal{N}$ party Weighted Graph State }
In this section we show how to write the expression of an arbitrary $\mathcal{N}$ party Weighted Graph State (WGS) along with the range of interaction which can be only nearest neighbor or next nearest neighbor or can be fully connected.The graph state consisting of vertices $V$ and the edges $E$ 
\begin{eqnarray}
    G&=&G(E,V)
\end{eqnarray}


We can relate this graph state with any physical system of quantum mechanics. The vertices corresponding to the physical particle or local quantum system $k$ and $l$ (qubits in spin 1/2 system in our case) and the edges corresponding to the interaction (unitary transformation) between the $k$th and $l$th particle as 
\begin{eqnarray}
U_{kl}&=&
    \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0&0\\
0 & 1 & 0&0\\
0&0&1&0\\
0&0&0& e^{-i \phi_{kl}}
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{eqnarray}

Irrespective of the dimensionality $d$ the spins are so arranged that initially they are completely ploarized in the $x$ direction. So we have taken the initial state as $\ket{\psi(t=0)}=\ket{+}^{\otimes \mathcal{N}}$. This class of state are very important in quantum computing.\\
Here $H_{kl}$ is the Hamiltonian what we  consider. Also $\phi_{kl}=g(k,l)t$ as our Hamiltonian is time independent.
Now to make life simple we are considering the uni directed graph $U_{kl}=U_{lk}$. Where the unitary remains similar after the interchange of the vertices. So we can define our weighted graph state as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \ket{G}&=&\prod_{k,l} U_{kl} \ket{+}^{\otimes \mathcal{N}}
\end{eqnarray}

We consider the unitary as $U_{kl}=\text{diag}(1, 1, 1, e^{-i \phi_{kl}})$ (for $\phi_{kl}=\pi$ this is CNOT gate). So the state can be written as 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \ket{\psi(t)}&=&\sum_{\eta=0}^{2^N-1}\exp\Big(-i\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\sum_{l>k}^{N}\phi_{kl}\delta_{a_k}^1\delta_{a_l}^1\Big)\ket{\eta}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\eta$ is decimal equivalent of the state that is $\ket{\eta}=\ket{a_1a_2a_3\dots }$ for all $i$, $a_i=0,1$ and $k,l$ are the position of the qubits.\\

\textcolor{red}{How to find eq. (2) -- detailed discussion to be added}

% We can construct the recursion relation between the $N$ party state and the $N+1$ party state. 
% \begin{align}
%     \ket{N+1}=\ket{N}\otimes\ket{\psi_1}_{N+1}
% \end{align}
% where 
% \begin{align}
%     \ket{\psi_1}_{N+1}=\sum_{\Bar{\eta}=0}^{1}\exp\Big(-i\sum_{\Bar{k}=1}^{N}\phi_{\Bar{k}{r}}\delta_{\Bar{k}p}\delta_{rq}\Big)\ket{\Bar{\eta}}
% \end{align}

% Similarly here $\Bar{\eta}$ is the decimal equivalent of the state. $r$ is the position of the $(N+1)$th qubit.
