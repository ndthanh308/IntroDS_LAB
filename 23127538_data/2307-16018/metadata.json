  "abstract": "The discrete data encoded in the power moments of a positive measure, fast decaying at infinity on euclidean space, is incomplete for recovery, leading to the concept of moment indeterminateness. On the other hand, classical integral transforms (Fourier-Laplace, Fantappiè, Poisson) of such measures are complete, often invertible via an effective inverse operation. The gap between the two non-uniqueness/ uniqueness phenomena is manifest in the dual picture, when trying to extend the measure, regarded as a positive linear functional, from the polynomial algebra to the full space of continuous functions. This point of view was advocated by Marcel Riesz a century ago, in the single real variable setting. Notable advances in functional analysis have root in Riesz' celebrated four notes devoted to the moment problem. A key technical ingredient being there the monotone approximation by polynomials of kernels of integral transforms. With inherent new obstacles we reappraise in the context of several real variables M. Riesz' variational principle. The result is an array of necessary and sufficient moment indeterminateness criteria, some raising real algebra questions, others involving intriguing analytic problems, all gravitating around the concept of moment separating function.",
