Mocking is an essential unit testing technique for isolating the class under test (CUT) from its dependencies.
Developers often leverage mocking frameworks to develop stub code that specifies the behaviors of mock objects.
However, developing and maintaining stub code is labor-intensive and error-prone.
In this paper, we present \tool{} to automatically generate and repair stub code for regression testing.
\tool{} implements a novel evolutionary algorithm that synthesizes test-passing stub code guided by the runtime behavior of test cases. 
We evaluated our proposed approach on \numOfBenchmarkEntries{} test cases from \numOfBenchmarkProjects{} open-source projects.
Our evaluation results show that \tool{} can effectively generate stub code for incomplete test cases without stub code and repair obsolete test cases with broken stub code.
