In this paper, we proved a generation theorem for bosonic Sobolev preserving quantum dynamical semigroups, which we also extended to time-dependent evolutions on bosonic multi-mode systems. The property of Sobolev preservation allowed all-time perturbation bounds, which we later applied to bosonic Gaussian semigroups, the quantum Ornstein Uhlenbeck semigroup, and CAT dissipations. As a consequence, we also established convergence results for the adherent points in the limit of large times. For this, we only required two physical assumptions on the generator (i) that it is in GKSL form with a Hamiltonian and jump-operators defined by polynomials in the annihilation and creation operators; and (ii) a bound on the output moments of the generator in terms of its input-moments. An interesting question for further work would be to further generalize the result by allowing different Sobolev spaces on which the semigroups are defined, and by this enlarge the class of generators covered by the generation theorem. In this line of research, a more detailed consideration of the Toffoli gate would be interesting.
