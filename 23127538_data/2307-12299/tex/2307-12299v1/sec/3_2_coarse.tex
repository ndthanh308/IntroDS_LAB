\subsection{Coarse Mesh Deformation}
\label{sec:coarse_deform}

As is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:framework}, the coarse mesh deformation module takes template meshes $\mathcal{M}_T=\left(\mathcal{V}_T, \mathcal{E}_T\right)$ as input and deforms them into $\mathcal{M}_c=\left(\mathcal{V}_c, \mathcal{E}_T\right)$ given the image features extracted from the voxel-based neural network. Our coarse mesh deformation module follows the design from Vox2Cortex \cite{bongratz2022vox2cortex}, using the same mesh templates, residual Unet-based segmentation branch \cite{zhang2018road, isensee2018nnu}, GCN-based mesh deformation branch \cite{ravi2020accelerating, bronstein2021geometric}, feature sampling, as well as training losses. However, we deform the template meshes only twice, in contrast to the four steps in Vox2Cortex. Coarse mesh deformation enables a good initialization for the subsequent oriented point cloud estimation, resulting in fewer outlier points. In our experiments, we utilize smaller templates ($\approx 42000$ vertices per surface) VoxCortex provides with their official implementation for both training and inference.
