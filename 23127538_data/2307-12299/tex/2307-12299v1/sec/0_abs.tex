%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   We present Hybrid-CSR, a geometric deep-learning model that combines explicit and implicit shape representations for cortical surface reconstruction. 
   %%
   Specifically, Hybrid-CSR begins with explicit deformations of template meshes to obtain coarsely reconstructed cortical surfaces, based on which the oriented point clouds are estimated for the subsequent differentiable poisson surface reconstruction. 
   %%
   By doing so, our method unifies explicit (oriented point clouds) and implicit (indicator function) cortical surface reconstruction. Compared to explicit representation-based methods, our hybrid approach is more friendly to capture detailed structures, and when compared with implicit representation-based methods, our method can be topology aware because of end-to-end training with a mesh-based deformation module.
   %%
   In order to address topology defects, we propose a new topology correction pipeline that relies on optimization-based diffeomorphic surface registration.
   %%
   Experimental results on three brain datasets show that our approach surpasses existing implicit and explicit cortical surface reconstruction methods in numeric metrics in terms of accuracy, regularity, and consistency.
