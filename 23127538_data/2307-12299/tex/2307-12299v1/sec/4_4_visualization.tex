\subsection{Results Visualization}
\label{sec:vis}
\input{fig/Vis}

The cortical surface reconstruction results generated by Hybrid-CSR are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:vis}, where $\hat{\mathcal{M}}$ denotes the surfaces reconstructed from PSR that are already well-aligned to the ground truth. After topology correction, $\hat{\mathcal{M}}_{tc}$ is smoother and topologically correct, and the surface refinement procedure further completes the details in the cortical reconstruction, as shown in $\hat{\mathcal{M}}_f$. More visualization of Hybrid-CSR with competing methods would be presented in supplementary material.
