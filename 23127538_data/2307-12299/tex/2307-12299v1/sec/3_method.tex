\section{Method}

\input{fig/framework}

In this section, we will provide a comprehensive description of our proposed method, Hybrid-CSR, which aims to couple explicit and implicit surface representations to enable accurate cortical surface reconstruction from 3D MRI. The pipeline of Hybrid-CSR consists of three main parts, including coarse mesh deformation (Sec.~\ref{sec:coarse_deform}), oriented point cloud estimation (Sec.~\ref{sec:opcl_est}), topology correction (Sec.~\ref{sec:tc}) and surface refinement (Sec.~\ref{sec:refine}). 
Prior to delving into the specifics of our method, we will first describe the methods of reconstructing surfaces from oriented point clouds using differentiable Poisson surface reconstruction (Sec.~\ref{sec:dpsr}) and modelling continuous deformations using diffeomorphic flow (Sec.~\ref{sec:cdf}).
