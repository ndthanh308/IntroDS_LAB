\section{Limitations and Further Directions}

Our proposed method for cortical surface reconstruction has some limitations that need to be considered. One issue is the running time, as our method uses neural fields-based diffeomorphic surface registration to correct topology, which takes about 2 minutes for 75-iteration optimizations. This makes it slower than methods \cite{lebrat2021corticalflow, santa2022corticalflow++, bongratz2022vox2cortex, hoopes2021topofit} relying on explicit surface reconstruction. To address this issue, a persistent homology prior can be imposed on the reconstructed indicator field to further eliminate the need for topology correction procedures in our proposed method. Additionally, memory consumption can be reduced by handling anatomical structures separately or sequentially. CorticalFlow++ has shown that reconstructing the gray matter surface starting from the white matter surface can be beneficial. These improvements will help us achieve even more accurate and efficient cortical surface reconstruction.

Another limitation lies in the data sources, where we used pseudo labels generated from Freesurfer without manually removing faulty labels from our training and test set. This may lead to inaccurate evaluation results and potentially overfitting to some noisy labels. Additionally, our method is not designed to handle MRI scans with significant domain shifts. That is, Hybrid-CSR may generate undesired results when applied to brain MRI scans with tumors or other morphological changes.
