\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduces Hybrid-CSR, a novel cortical surface reconstruction framework that leverages both explicit and implicit shape representations through differentiable Poisson surface reconstruction. The proposed method includes a new topology correction pipeline that employs continuous diffeomorphic flow optimization. The effectiveness of Hybrid-CSR is evaluated on multiple brain datasets, and it shows competitive performance in terms of accuracy, regularity and consistency. Moreover, the versatility of our method extends beyond the cortical surface reconstruction problem and has the potential for wide application in a variety of surface reconstruction scenarios.
