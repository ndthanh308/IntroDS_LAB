  "abstract": "We extend Moonen's definition of Ekedahl-Oort types of smooth curves in terms of Hasse-Witt triples to all stable curves and show that it matches Ekedahl and van der Geer's definition of Ekedahl-Oort types of their generalized Jacobians as semi-abelian varieties. Using this intrinsic insight, we can compute the dimensions of certain Ekedahl-Oort loci of curves and generalize some previously known results about the dimensions of the $p$-rank and $a$-number loci of curves.",
