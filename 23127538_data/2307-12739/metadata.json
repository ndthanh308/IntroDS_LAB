  "abstract": "In this paper we consider structures of complex Poisson brackets on the space of smooth functions in a $n$-dimensional complex manifold generated by the $(1,1)$-form $d=\\partial+\\overline{\\partial}$-closed and non-degenerate (with non-holomorphic and non-antiholomorphic coefficients). In this case, we have view the compatibility between complex Poisson and Riemannian structures and an example is giving in $\\C^\\ast$.",
