\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
Generalized implicit FTRL as a flexible framework, allows the design of new algorithms and immediate theoretical analysis. By proving that IWA is a concrete instantiation of this new framework, we prove that IWA updates have a regret bound that is \emph{better} than the one of plain OGD, and provide a perspective to interpret IWA updates as approximate implicit/proximal updates.
