  "abstract": "Since existing mobile communication networks may not be able to meet the low latency and high-efficiency requirements of emerging technologies and applications, novel network architectures need to be investigated to support these new requirements. As a new network architecture that integrates satellite systems, air networks and ground communication, Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) has attracted extensive attention in recent years. This paper summarizes the recent research work on SAGIN from several aspects, with the basic information of SAGIN first introduced, followed by the physical characteristics. Then the drive and prospects of the current SAGIN architecture in supporting new requirements are deeply analyzed. On this basis, the requirements and challenges are analyzed. Finally, it summarizes the existing solutions and prospects the future research directions.",
