Figure~\ref{fig:inc_accuracy} shows the evolution of average accuracy of different methods on (a) BloodMNIST, (b) PathMNIST and (c) OrganaMNIST datasets with 200 memory samples. We observe that our proposed method consistently outperforms other baseline methods in consecitive tasks throughout the learning experience.
