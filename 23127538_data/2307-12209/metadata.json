  "abstract": "As is well known, we can average the eigenfunction $y^s$ of the hyperbolic Laplacian on the hyperbolic plane by $Γ$ a lattice in $\\mathbf{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ to obtain an automorphic form, the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series $E_\\mathfrak{a} (z,s)$.\n  In this note, we choose a particular eigenfunction $y^s dx$ of the Hodge-Laplace operator for 1-forms on the hyperbolic plane. Then, we average by $Γ$ to define a 1-form $E_\\mathfrak{a}^1 \\big( (z,v), s \\big)$.\n  We see that $E_\\mathfrak{a}^1$ admits a Fourier expansion and calculates the corresponding coefficients. Also, we evaluate the integral $\\int_γ E_\\mathfrak{a}^1$ for when $γ$ is a lifting of horocycles and closed geodesics in the unit tangent bundle. Finally, we will obtain an analog to the Rankin-Selberg method for $E_\\mathfrak{a}^1$.",
