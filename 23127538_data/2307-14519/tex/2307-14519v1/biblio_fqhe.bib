title = {Stability of the k = 3 Read–Rezayi state in chiral two-dimensional systems with tunable interactions},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {The k = 3 Read–Rezayi (RR) parafermion quantum Hall state hosts non-Abelian excitations which provide a platform for universal topological quantum computation. Although the RR state may be realized at the filling factor ν = 12/5 in GaAs-based two-dimensional electron systems, the corresponding quantum Hall state is weak and at present nearly impossible to study experimentally. Here we argue that the RR state can alternatively be realized in a class of chiral materials with massless and massive Dirac-like band structure. This family of materials encompasses monolayer and bilayer graphene, as well as topological insulators. We show that, compared to GaAs, these systems provide several important advantages in realizing and studying the RR state. Most importantly, the effective interactions can be tuned in situ by varying the external magnetic field, and by designing the dielectric environment of the sample. This tunability enables the realization of RR state with controllable energy gaps in different Landau levels. It also allows one to probe the quantum phase transitions to other compressible and incompressible phases.}

@article{Alicea12,
	abstract = {The 1937 theoretical discovery of Majorana fermions---whose defining property is that they are their own anti-particles---has since impacted diverse problems ranging from neutrino physics and dark matter searches to the fractional quantum Hall effect and superconductivity. Despite this long history the unambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an outstanding goal. This review paper highlights recent advances in the condensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe that this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail exotic `topological' one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support Majorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one of the key insights that arose during the past few years; namely, that it is possible to `engineer' such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by forming appropriate heterostructures with ordinary s-wave superconductors. Numerous proposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as topological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals and many others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects Majorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes of measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling, Josephson effects and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable properties of condensed matter Majorana fermions---the non-Abelian exchange statistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum computation.},

	abstract = {The emergence of non-Abelian anyons from large collections of interacting elementary particles is a conceptually beautiful phenomenon with important ramifications for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Over the last few decades the field has evolved from a highly theoretical subject to an active experimental area, particularly following proposals for trapping non-Abelian anyons in `engineered' structures built from well-understood components. In this short overview we briefly tour the impressive progress that has taken place in the quest for the simplest type of non-Abelian anyon---defects binding Majorana zero modes---and then turn to similar strategies for pursuing more exotic excitations. Specifically, we describe how interfacing simple quantum Hall systems with conventional superconductors yields `parafermionic' generalizations of Majorana modes and even Fibonacci anyons---the latter enabling fully fault tolerant universal quantum computation. We structure our treatment in a manner that unifies these topics in a coherent way. The ideas synthesized here spotlight largely uncharted experimental territory in the field of quantum Hall physics that appears ripe for discovery.},

First we generalize the intimate connection between the -symmetric Ising quantum spin chain and Majorana fermions to -symmetric chains and parafermions. In particular, we highlight how parafermion chains host a topological phase featuring protected edge zero modes. We then tour several blueprints for the laboratory realization of parafermion zero modes---focusing on quantum Hall/superconductor hybrids, quantum Hall bilayers, and two-dimensional topological insulators---and describe striking experimental fingerprints that they provide. Finally, we discuss how coupled parafermion arrays in quantum Hall architectures yield topological phases that potentially furnish hardware for a universal, intrinsically decoherence-free quantum computer.},

@article{Amet16,
	abstract = {In superconductors, the electrical current is carried by {\textquotedblleft}Cooper pairs,{\textquotedblright} formed out of an electron and a hole. This supercurrent will happily cross a thin barrier between two superconductors. But what if a strong magnetic field were applied at the barrier, forcing charge carriers to travel only along the edge of the barrier? Amet et al. explored this regime in a sample consisting of two superconducting electrodes and a graphene barrier under magnetic fields of up to 2 tesla (see the Perspective by Mason). Their transport measurements were consistent with a model in which the supercurrent was carried by the edge states in graphene.Science, this issue p. 966; see also p. 891A promising route for creating topological states and excitations is to combine superconductivity and the quantum Hall (QH) effect. Despite this potential, signatures of superconductivity in the QH regime remain scarce, and a superconducting current through a QH weak link has been challenging to observe. We demonstrate the existence of a distinct supercurrent mechanism in encapsulated graphene samples contacted by superconducting electrodes, in magnetic fields as high as 2 tesla. The observation of a supercurrent in the QH regime marks an important step in the quest for exotic topological excitations, such as Majorana fermions and parafermions, which may find applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Novel systems of layered graphene are attracting interest for theories and applications. The stability, band structures of few-layer graphite films, and their dependence on electric field applied along the c-axis are examined within the density functional theory. We predict that those of Bernal type and also rhombohedral type tri- and tetra-layer graphite films exhibit stability. Rhombohedral-type systems, including AB-bilayer, show variable band gap induced by perpendicular electric fields, whereas the other systems, such as the Bernal-type films, stay semi-metallic.},

@article{Balram16d,
	abstract = {The multitude of excitations of the fractional quantum Hall state are very accurately understood, microscopically, as excitations of composite fermions across their Landau-like $\Lambda$ levels. In particular, the dispersion of the composite fermion exciton, which is the lowest energy spin conserving neutral excitation, displays filling-factor-specific minima called ``magnetoroton'' minima. Simon and Halperin employed the Chern-Simons field theory of composite fermions [Phys. Rev. B 48, 17368 (1993)] to predict the magnetoroton minima positions. Recently, Golkar et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 216403 (2016)] have modeled the neutral excitations as deformations of the composite fermion Fermi sea, which results in a prediction for the positions of the magnetoroton minima. Using methods of the microscopic composite fermion theory we calculate the positions of the roton minima for filling factors up to 5/11 along the sequence s/ (2s + 1) and find them to be in reasonably good agreement with both the Chern-Simons field theory of composite fermions and Golkar et al.'s theory. We also find that the positions of the roton minima are insensitive to the microscopic interaction in agreement with Golkar et al.'s theory. As a byproduct of our calculations, we obtain the charge and neutral gaps for the fully spin polarized states along the sequence s/ (2s {\textpm} 1) in the lowest Landau level and the n = 1 Landau level of graphene.},

	abstract = {The fractional quantum Hall effect has inspired searches for exotic emergent topological particles, such as fractionally charged excitations, composite fermions, abelian and nonabelian anyons and Majorana fermions. Fractionally charged skyrmions, which support both topological charge and topological vortex-like spin structure, have also been predicted to occur in the vicinity of 1/3 filling of the lowest Landau level. The fractional skyrmions, however, are anticipated to be exceedingly fragile, suppressed by very small Zeeman energies. Here we show that, slightly away from 1/3 filling, the smallest manifestations of the fractional skyrmion exist in the excitation spectrum for a broad range of Zeeman energies, and appear in resonant inelastic light scattering experiments as well-defined resonances slightly below the long wavelength spin wave mode. The spectroscopy of these exotic bound states serves as a sensitive tool for investigating the residual interaction between composite fermions, responsible for delicate new fractional quantum Hall states in this filling factor region.},

	abstract = {Topological states of matter are characterized by topological invariants, which are physical quantities whose values are quantized and do not depend on the details?of the system (such as its shape, size and impurities). Of these?quantities, the easiest to probe is the electrical Hall conductance, and fractional values (in units of e2/h, where e is the electronic charge and h is the Planck constant) of this quantity attest to topologically ordered states, which carry quasiparticles with fractional charge and anyonic statistics. Another topological invariant is the thermal Hall conductance, which is harder to measure. For the quantized thermal Hall conductance, a fractional value in units of k0?(k0?=?p2kB2/(3h), where kB is the Boltzmann constant) proves that the state of matter is non-Abelian. Such non-Abelian states lead to ground-state degeneracy and perform topological unitary transformations when braided, which can be useful for topological quantum computation. Here we report measurements of the thermal Hall conductance of several quantum Hall states in the first excited Landau level and find that the thermal Hall conductance of the 5/2 state is compatible with a half-integer value of 2.5k0, demonstrating its non-Abelian nature.},

@phdthesis{Barkeshli10a,
	abstract = {This thesis is focused on the theoretical characterization of topological order in non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. The first part of the thesis is concerned with the ideal wave function approach to FQH states, where the idea is to try to obtain model wave functions and model Hamiltonians for all possible FQH states and to have a physical way of characterizing their topological order. I will explain recent attempts to do this through the so-called pattern of zeros framework and its relation to conformal field theory. The first chapter about the pattern of zeros introduces the basic concepts for single-component FQH states, how it relates to the conformal field theory approach to FQH wave functions, and how it can be used to derive various topological properties of FQH states. The second chapter extends the pattern of zeros framework to multi-component non-Abelian FQH states; this is an attempt at a full classification of possible topological orders in FQH states. Aside from the ideal wave function methods. the other known general method of constructing non-Abelian FQH states is through the parton construction. Here the idea is to break apart the electron into other fermions, called partons. and assume that they form integer quantum Hall states. This method allows us to describe all known FQH states. After reviewing the parton construction, I will demonstrate how it can be used to derive the low energy effective field theories for some of the most well-known non-Abelian FQH states, the Zk parafermion (Laughlin/Moore-Read/Read-Rezayi) states. The parton construction will motivate yet another topological field theory, the U(1) x U(1) x Z2 Chern-Simons (CS) theory. I will demonstrate how to calculate many highly non-trivial topological properties of the U(1) x U(1) x Z2 CS theory, such as ground state degeneracy on genus g surfaces and various fusion properties of the quasiparticles. Using the U(1) x U(1) x Z2 CS theory, we will study phase transitions between bilayer Abelian states and non-Abelian states. The non-Abelian ones contain a series of new states, which we call the orbifold FQH states. These orbifold FQH states turn out to be important for the conceptual foundations of the pattern of zeros/vertex algebra approach to ideal FQH wave functions. We also find a series of non-Abelian topological phases - which are not FQH states and do not have protected gapless edge modes - that are separated from the deconfined phase of ZN gauge theories by a continuous phase transition. We give a preliminary analysis of these Z2 "twisted" ZN topological phases.},

	abstract = {In this article we review the quantum Hall physics of graphene-based two-dimensional electron systems, with a special focus on recent experimental and theoretical developments. We explain why graphene and bilayer graphene can be viewed respectively as J = 1 and 2 chiral two-dimensional electron gases (C2DEGs), and why this property frames their quantum Hall physics. The current status of experimental and theoretical work on the role of electron--electron interactions is reviewed at length with an emphasis on unresolved issues in the field, including the role of disorder in current experiments. Special attention is given to the interesting low magnetic field limit, and to the relationship between quantum Hall effects and the spontaneous anomalous Hall effects that might occur in bilayer graphene systems in the absence of a magnetic field.},

	abstract = {Elementary particles in three dimensions are either bosons or fermions, depending on their spin. In two dimensions, it is in principle possible to have particles that lie somewhere in between, but detecting the statistics of these so-called anyons directly is tricky. Bartolomei et al. built a collider of anyons in a two-dimensional electron gas of GaAs/AlGaAs (see the Perspective by Feldman). Two beams of anyons collided at a beam splitter and then exited the device at two outputs. The researchers studied the correlations of current fluctuations at the outputs, which revealed signatures of anyonic statistics.Science, this issue p. 173; see also p. 131Two-dimensional systems can host exotic particles called anyons whose quantum statistics are neither bosonic nor fermionic. For example, the elementary excitations of the fractional quantum Hall effect at filling factor ν = 1/m (where m is an odd integer) have been predicted to obey Abelian fractional statistics, with a phase ϕ associated with the exchange of two particles equal to π/m. However, despite numerous experimental attempts, clear signatures of fractional statistics have remained elusive. We experimentally demonstrate Abelian fractional statistics at filling factor ν =  1/3 by measuring the current correlations resulting from the collision between anyons at a beamsplitter. By analyzing their dependence on the anyon current impinging on the splitter and comparing with recent theoretical models, we extract ϕ = π/3, in agreement with predictions.},

	abstract = { Majorana fermions (particles that are their own antiparticle) may or may not exist in nature as elementary building blocks, but in condensed matter they can be constructed out of electron and hole excitations. What is needed is a superconductor to hide the charge difference and a topological (Berry) phase to eliminate the energy difference from zero-point motion. A pair of widely separated Majorana fermions, bound to magnetic or electrostatic defects, has non-Abelian exchange statistics. A qubit encoded in this Majorana pair is expected to have an unusually long coherence time. I discuss strategies to detect Majorana fermions in a topological superconductor, as well as possible applications in a quantum computer. The status of the experimental search is reviewed. },

Two groups studied the nature of this hydrodynamic flow in different regimes (see the Perspective by Lucas). Gallagher et al. measured optical conductivity using a waveguide-based setup, revealing signatures of quantum criticality near the charge neutrality point. Berdyugin et al. focused on electron transport in the presence of a magnetic field and measured a counterintuitive contribution to the Hall response that stems from hydrodynamic flow.Science, this issue p. 158, p. 162; see also p. 125An electrical conductor subjected to a magnetic field exhibits the Hall effect in the presence of current flow. Here, we report a qualitative deviation from the standard behavior in electron systems with high viscosity. We found that the viscous electron fluid in graphene responds to nonquantizing magnetic fields by producing an electric field opposite to that generated by the ordinary Hall effect. The viscous contribution is substantial and identified by studying local voltages that arise in the vicinity of current-injecting contacts. We analyzed the anomaly over a wide range of temperatures and carrier densities and extracted the Hall viscosity, a dissipationless transport coefficient that was long identified theoretically but remained elusive in experiments.},

Their microscopic Hamiltonian description, however, strongly depends on geometrical details. Recent work has shown how this dependence can be exploited to generate effective models that are both interesting in their own right and also provide further insight into the quantum Hall system. We review and expand on recent efforts to understand the FQH system close to the solvable thin-torus limit in terms of effective spin chains. In particular, we clarify how the difference between the bosonic and fermionic FQH states, which is not apparent in the thin-torus limit, can be seen at this level. Additionally, we discuss the relation of the Haldane--Shastry chain to the so-called QH circle limit and comment on its significance to recent entanglement studies.},

@article{Berdyugin18,
	abstract = {Electrons can move through graphene in a manner reminiscent of fluids, if the conditions are right. Two groups studied the nature of this hydrodynamic flow in different regimes (see the Perspective by Lucas). Gallagher et al. measured optical conductivity using a waveguide-based setup, revealing signatures of quantum criticality near the charge neutrality point. Berdyugin et al. focused on electron transport in the presence of a magnetic field and measured a counterintuitive contribution to the Hall response that stems from hydrodynamic flow.Science, this issue p. 158, p. 162; see also p. 125An electrical conductor subjected to a magnetic field exhibits the Hall effect in the presence of current flow. Here, we report a qualitative deviation from the standard behavior in electron systems with high viscosity. We found that the viscous electron fluid in graphene responds to nonquantizing magnetic fields by producing an electric field opposite to that generated by the ordinary Hall effect. The viscous contribution is substantial and identified by studying local voltages that arise in the vicinity of current-injecting contacts. We analyzed the anomaly over a wide range of temperatures and carrier densities and extracted the Hall viscosity, a dissipationless transport coefficient that was long identified theoretically but remained elusive in experiments.},

@article{Bhatt21,
	abstract = {We discuss the problem of localization in two dimensional electron systems in the quantum Hall (single Landau level) regime. After briefly summarizing the well-studied problem of Anderson localization in the non-interacting case, we concentrate on the problem of disorder induced many-body localization (MBL) in the presence of electron--electron interactions using numerical exact diagonalization and eigenvalue spacing statistics as a function of system size. We provide evidence showing that MBL is not attainable in a single Landau level with short range (white noise) disorder in the thermodynamic limit. We then study the interplay of topology and localization, by contrasting the behavior of topological and nontopological subbands arising from a single Landau level in two models --- (i) a pair of extremely flat Hofstadter bands with an optimally chosen periodic potential, and (ii) a Landau level with a split-off nontopological impurity band. Both models provide convincing evidence for the strong effect of topology on the feasibility of many-body localization as well as slow dynamics starting from a nonequilibrium state with charge imbalance.},

	abstract = {Chiral conformal field theories are characterized by a ground-state current at finite temperature, that could be observed, e.g., in the edge excitations of the quantum Hall effect. We show that the corresponding thermal conductance is directly proportional to the gravitational anomaly of the conformal theory, upon extending the well-known relation between specific heat and conformal anomaly. The thermal current could signal the elusive neutral edge modes that are expected in the hierarchical Hall states. We then compute the thermal conductance for the Abelian multi-component theory and the W1+∞ minimal model, two conformal theories that are good candidates for describing the hierarchical states. Their conductances agree to leading order but differ in the first, universal finite-size correction, that could be used as a selective experimental signature.},

@article{Cappelli01,
	abstract = {The Zk-parafermion Hall state is an incompressible fluid of k-electron clusters generalizing the Pfaffian state of paired electrons. Extending our earlier analysis of the Pfaffian, we introduce two ``parent'' abelian Hall states which reduce to the parafermion state by projecting out some neutral degrees of freedom. The first abelian state is a generalized (331) state which describes clustering of k distinguishable electrons and reproduces the parafermion state upon symmetrization over the electron coordinates. This description yields simple expressions for the quasi-particle wave functions of the parafermion state. The second abelian state is realized by a conformal theory with a (2k−1)-dimensional chiral charge lattice and it reduces to the Zk-parafermion state via the coset construction su(k)1̂⊕su(k)1̂/su(k)2̂. The detailed study of this construction provides us with a complete account of the excitations of the parafermion Hall state, including the field identifications, the Zk symmetry and the partition function.},

@article{Cappelli93,
	abstract = {Free planar electrons in a uniform magnetic field are shown to possess the dynamical symmetry of area-preserving diffeomorphisms (W-infinity algebra). Intuitively, this is a consequence of gauge invariance, which forces dynamics to depend only on the flux. The infinity of generators of this symmetry act within each Landau level, which is infinite dimensional in the thermodynamic limit. The incompressible ground states corresponding to completely filled Landau levels (integer quantum Hall effect) possess a dynamical symmetry, since they are left invariant by an infinite subset of generators. This geometrical characterization of incompressibility also holds for fractional fillings of the lowest level (simplest fractional Hall effect) in the presence of Haldane's effective two-body interactions. Although these modify the symmetry algebra, the corresponding incompressible ground states proposed by Laughlin are again symmetric with respect to the modified infinite algebra.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of finite-frequency noise for the ν = 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state in a quantum point contact geometry. The results were obtained within the Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian models. We show that the behaviour of the coloured noise allows us to unambiguously discriminate among tunnelling excitations with different charges. Optimal values of the external bias are found in order to emphasize the visibility of the noise peak associated with the tunnelling of a 2-agglomerate, namely an excitation with charge that is double the fundamental one. These correspond to the regime in which the bias is larger than the neutral modes cut-off frequency. The dependence on temperature is also investigated to discriminate between the considered models.},

	abstract = {We construct the wavefunctions for the Moore--Read ν = 5/2 quantum Hall state on a torus in the presence of two quasiholes. These explicit wavefunctions allow us to compute the monodromy matrix that describes the effect of quasihole motion on the space of degenerate ground states. The result agrees with the recent discussion by Oshikawa et al (Ann. Phys.at press). Our calculation provides a conformal field theory explanation of why certain transitions between ground states are forbidden. It is because taking a quasihole around a generator of the torus can change the fusion channel of the two quasiholes, and this requires a change of parity of the electron number in some of the ground states.},

@article{Chung21,
	abstract = {Two-dimensional electrons confined to GaAs quantum wells are hallmark platforms for probing electron--electron interactions. Many key observations have been made in these systems as sample quality has improved over the years. Here, we present a breakthrough in sample quality via source-material purification and innovation in GaAs molecular beam epitaxy vacuum chamber design. Our samples display an ultra-high mobility of 44{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}106{\thinspace}cm2{\thinspace}V--1{\thinspace}s--1 at an electron density of 2.0{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}1011{\thinspace}cm--2. These results imply only 1 residual impurity for every 1010 Ga/As atoms. The impact of such low impurity concentration is manifold. Robust stripe and bubble phases are observed, and several new fractional quantum Hall states emerge. Furthermore, the activation gap ($\Delta$) of the fractional quantum Hall state at the Landau-level filling ($\nu$) = 5/2, which is widely believed to be non-Abelian and of potential use for topological quantum computing, reaches $\Delta$ ≈ 820{\thinspace}mK. We expect that our results will stimulate further research on interaction-driven physics in a two-dimensional setting and substantially advance the field.},

	abstract = {The integer quantum Hall transition (IQHT) is one of the most mysterious members of the family of Anderson transitions. Since the 1980s, the scaling behavior near the IQHT has been vigorously studied in experiments and numerical simulations. Despite all efforts, it is notoriously difficult to pin down the precise values of critical exponents, which seem to vary with model details and thus challenge the principle of universality. Recently, M. Zirnbauer (2019) has conjectured a conformal field theory for the transition, in which linear terms in the beta-functions vanish, leading to a very slow flow in the fixed point's vicinity which we term marginal scaling. In this work, we provide numerical evidence for such a scenario by using extensive simulations of various network models of the IQHT at unprecedented length scales. At criticality, we show that the finite-size scaling of the disorder averaged longitudinal Landauer conductance is consistent with its recently predicted fixed-point value and a third-order expansion of RG beta functions. In the future, our numerical findings can be checked with analytical results from the conformal field theory. Away from criticality we describe a mechanism that could account for the emergence of an effective critical exponents νeff, which is necessarily dependent on the parameters of the model. We further support this idea by numerical determination of νeff in suitably chosen models.},

@article{Drichko19,
	abstract = {Using acoustic method we study dependences of transverse AC conductance, σ(ω), on magnetic field, temperature and the amplitude of AC electric field in a wide (75 nm) quantum well (QW) structure focusing on the vicinity of the filling factor ν = 1/2. Measurements are performed in the frequency domain 30--307 MHz and in the temperature domain 20--500 mK. Usually, in wide QW structures closely to ν = 1/2 the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) regime is realized at some parameters of the sample. However, in our structure, at ν = 1/2 it is a compressible state corresponding to gas of composite fermions which is observed. This is confirmed by apparent frequency independence and weakly decreasing temperature dependence of Re σ(ω). Comparing the dependences of this quantity on temperature and power of the acoustic wave we conclude that the observed nonlinear behavior of the conductance is compatible with heating of the composite fermions by the acoustic wave. For comparison, we also study the vicinity of ν = 3/2 where the FQHE regime is clearly observed.},

Specifically, the maximum value of dpxydB and the width of pxx show the same power law dependence on T, i.e. ~T−K. The critical exponent K=0.43 $\pm$ 0.02.This power law dependence is the same as that obtained in the integral quantum Hall effect (IQHE) [Wei et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 61 (1988) 1294], in analogy to which our result indicates the existence of a divergent correlation length for the wavefunction of the quasi-particles in the FQHE for 13 < v <25. The localization to delocalization transition can be characterized by a universal critical exponent, k, in both the IQHE and the FQHE.},

    abstract={Interacting electrons in flat bands give rise to a variety of quantum phases. One fundamental aspect of such states is the ordering of the various flavours---such as spin or valley---that the electrons can possess and the excitation spectrum of the broken-symmetry states that they form. These properties cannot be probed directly with electrical transport measurements. The zeroth Landau level of monolayer graphene with fourfold spin--valley degeneracy is a model system for such investigations, but the nature of its broken-symmetry states---particularly at partial fillings---is still not understood. Here we demonstrate a non-invasive spectroscopic technique with a scanning tunneling microscope and use it to perform measurements of the valley polarization of the electronic wavefunctions and their excitation spectrum in the partially filled zeroth Landau level of graphene. We can extract information such as the strength of the Haldane pseudopotentials that characterize the repulsive interactions underlying the fractional quantum states. Our experiments also demonstrate that fractional quantum Hall phases are built upon broken-symmetry states that persist at partial filling. Our experimental approach quantifies the valley phase diagram of the partially filled Landau level as a model flat-band platform, which is applicable to other graphene-based electronic systems.},

	abstract = {The electronic system in a strongly correlated material can sometimes be less symmetrical than the underlying crystal lattice. This loss of symmetry, caused by interactions and dubbed electronic nematicity, has been observed in a number of exotic materials. However, establishing a direct connection between the interactions and nematicity is tricky. Feldman et al. used scanning tunneling microscopy to image the wave functions of electrons on the surface of bismuth placed in an external magnetic field. The exchange interactions in the material caused a loss of symmetry, which was reflected in the orientations of the electrons{\textquoteright} elliptical orbits.Science, this issue p. 316Nematic quantum fluids with wave functions that break the underlying crystalline symmetry can form in interacting electronic systems. We examined the quantum Hall states that arise in high magnetic fields from anisotropic hole pockets on the Bi(111) surface. Spectroscopy performed with a scanning tunneling microscope showed that a combination of single-particle effects and many-body Coulomb interactions lift the six-fold Landau level (LL) degeneracy to form three valley-polarized quantum Hall states. We imaged the resulting anisotropic LL wave functions and found that they have a different orientation for each broken-symmetry state. The wave functions correspond to those expected from pairs of hole valleys and provide a direct spatial signature of a nematic electronic phase.},

	abstract = {We study two alternative definitions of localized states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) on a torus. One definition is to construct localized states, as the projection of the coordinate delta function onto the LLL. Another definition, proposed by Haldane, is to consider the set of functions which have all their zeros at a single point. Since a LLL wave function on a torus, supporting N ϕ magnetic flux quanta, is uniquely defined by the position of its N ϕ zeros, this defines a set of functions that are expected to be localized around the point maximally far away from the zeros. These two families of localized states have many properties in common with the coherent states on the plane and on the sphere, viz a resolution of unity and a self-reproducing kernel. However, we show that only the projected delta function is maximally localized. Additionally, we show how to project onto the LLL, functions that contain holomorphic derivatives and/or anti-holomorphic polynomials, and apply our methods in the description of hierarchical quantum Hall liquids.},

	abstract = {The entanglement entropy of the incompressible states of a realistic quantum Hall system in the second Landau level is studied by direct diagonalization. The subdominant term of the area law, the topological entanglement entropy, which is believed to carry information about topological order in the ground state, was extracted for filling factors ν = 12/5 and ν = 7/3. While it is difficult to make strong conclusions about ν = 12/5, the ν = 7/3 state appears to be very consistent with the topological entanglement entropy for the k = 4 Read--Rezayi state. The effect of finite thickness corrections to the Coulomb potential used in the direct diagonalization is also systematically studied.},

@article{Fu16,
	abstract = {The 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state has captured the fascination of the scientific and nonscientific community, because of proposals to use it for quantum computation. These proposals have been based on the premise that the quasiparticles in this state have non-Abelian statistics. Experiments supporting both Abelian 5/2 state and non-Abelian 5/2 state have been reported, and no consensus has been reached. Using measurements of tunneling between edge states, we suggest that both the Abelian and non-Abelian states can be stable in the same device but under different conditions. Our discovery resolves the inconsistencies between existing experiments. More importantly, the knowledge of the competition between ground states is important for maintaining non-Abelian statistics in application to topological quantum computation.Some theories predict that the filling factor 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state can exhibit non-Abelian statistics, which makes it a candidate for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Although the non-Abelian Pfaffian state and its particle-hole conjugate, the anti-Pfaffian state, are the most plausible wave functions for the 5/2 state, there are a number of alternatives with either Abelian or non-Abelian statistics. Recent experiments suggest that the tunneling exponents are more consistent with an Abelian state rather than a non-Abelian state. Here, we present edge-current{\textendash}tunneling experiments in geometrically confined quantum point contacts, which indicate that Abelian and non-Abelian states compete at filling factor 5/2. Our results are consistent with a transition from an Abelian state to a non-Abelian state in a single quantum point contact when the confinement is tuned. Our observation suggests that there is an intrinsic non-Abelian 5/2 ground state but that the appropriate confinement is necessary to maintain it. This observation is important not only for understanding the physics of the 5/2 state but also for the design of future topological quantum computation devices.},

@article{Geraedts16,
	abstract = {In an external magnetic field, the energy of an electron in a two-dimensional system takes discrete values, called Landau levels. At high enough fields, all electrons in a solid can fit in the lowest Landau level. If exactly half of that level is filled with electrons, standard theory predicts that a special fermion liquid phase will form that makes a distinction between the filled and empty states (particles and holes). A recent conjecture, in contrast, predicted a liquid consisting of massless Dirac particles that respects the symmetry between particles and holes. Geraedts et al. used sophisticated numerical methods to provide strong evidence for this conjecture.Science, this issue p. 197In a two-dimensional electron gas under a strong magnetic field, correlations generate emergent excitations distinct from electrons. It has been predicted that {\textquotedblleft}composite fermions{\textquotedblright}{\textemdash}bound states of an electron with two magnetic flux quanta{\textemdash}can experience zero net magnetic field and form a Fermi sea. Using infinite-cylinder density matrix renormalization group numerical simulations, we verify the existence of this exotic Fermi sea, but find that the phase exhibits particle-hole symmetry. This is self-consistent only if composite fermions are massless Dirac particles, similar to the surface of a topological insulator. Exploiting this analogy, we observe the suppression of 2kF backscattering, a characteristic of Dirac particles. Thus, the phenomenology of Dirac fermions is also relevant to two-dimensional electron gases in the quantum Hall regime.},

This classification, and a criterion for the validity of the mean-field approximation in the charge-density-wave phase, is based on scaling arguments concerning the effective interaction potential of electrons restricted to an arbitrary Landau level. Finite-temperature effects are investigated within the same formalism, and a good agreement with recent experiments is obtained.}

	abstract = {We consider gapped fractional quantum Hall states on the lowest Landau level when the Coulomb energy is much smaller than the cyclotron energy. We introduce two spectral densities, $\rho$T($\omega$) and {\$}{\$} {\{}{\backslash}overline{\{}{\backslash}rho{\}}{\}}{\_}T{\backslash}left({\backslash}omega {\backslash}right) {\$}{\$}, which are proportional to the probabilities of absorption of circularly polarized gravitons by the quantum Hall system. We prove three sum rules relating these spectral densities with the shift {\$}{\$} {\backslash}mathcal{\{}S{\}} {\$}{\$}, the q4 coefficient of the static structure factor S4, and the high-frequency shear modulus of the ground state $\mu$∞, which is precisely defined. We confirm an inequality, first suggested by Haldane, that S4 is bounded from below by {\$}{\$} {\backslash}left|{\backslash}mathcal{\{}S{\}} - 1{\backslash}right|/8 {\$}{\$}. The Laughlin wavefunction saturates this bound, which we argue to imply that systems with ground state wavefunctions close to Laughlin's absorb gravitons of predominantly one circular polarization. We consider a nonlinear model where the sum rules are saturated by a single magneto-roton mode. In this model, the magneto-roton arises from the mixing between oscillations of an internal metric and the hydrodynamic motion. Implications for experiments are briefly discussed.},

@article{Greiter92a,
	abstract = {The principle that perturbation in quantum statistics should be accompanied by application of an appropriate magnetic field has been successful in giving a simple understanding of major qualitative features of the fractional quantized Hall states and related anyon superconducting states. In these applications, the starting point is one or more filled Landau levels. Here we consider the question of perturbation around free fermions. We argue that very near this point the statistical interactions are weak and their effects calculable; nevertheless they have the important qualitative consequence that a p-wave BCS pairing instability is triggered. The result is a new line of incompressible states in the (inverse) filling-fraction-statistics plane. This line extrapolates to a state obeying Fermi statistics at filling fractio 12, which is a candidate to describe electron states. A variety of techniques is then employed to elucidate the properties of this state and the unusual quasiparticles it supports. We believe the state is in the same universality class as one Halperin proposed based on grouping electrons into pairs of tightly bound bosonic molecules, which form a correlated state of the Laughlin type. We report the results of extensive numerical work which establishes firmly the existence of an incompressible state with the properties we predict, including the very unusual quasiparticles, for simple model potentials. We also investigate the situation for realistic potentials, and conclude that a paired Hall state of the type investigated here is a good candidate to describe real 2d electron gases, especially for thick samples and higher Landau levels, quite possibly including the state at filling fraction 52 that has already been observed.},

For our purposes here, however, we will view it primarily as an exact model, that is, a ground state which supports fractionally quantized excitations, and a model Hamiltonian for which this ground state is exact.},

The Fock space of the anyons is discussed, and the theory is related to that of edge excitations of an anyon droplet in a harmonic-oscillator well.},

	abstract = {We report a systematic study of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method on two different geometries: the sphere and the cylinder. We provide convergence benchmarks based on model Hamiltonians known to possess exact zero-energy ground states, as well as an analysis of the number of sweeps and basis elements that need to be kept in order to achieve the desired accuracy. The ground state energies of the Coulomb Hamiltonian at ν=1/3 and ν=5/2 filling are extracted and compared with the results obtained by previous DMRG implementations in the literature. A remarkably rapid convergence in the cylinder geometry is noted and suggests that this boundary condition is particularly suited for the application of the DMRG method to the FQHE.},

	abstract = {The high magnetic field electronic structure of bilayer graphene is enhanced by the spin, valley isospin, and an accidental orbital degeneracy, leading to a complex phase diagram of broken symmetry states. Here, we present a technique for measuring the layer-resolved charge density, from which we directly determine the valley and orbital polarization within the zero energy Landau level. Layer polarization evolves in discrete steps across 32 electric field-tuned phase transitions between states of different valley, spin, and orbital order, including previously unobserved orbitally polarized states stabilized by skew interlayer hopping. We fit our data to a model that captures both single-particle and interaction-induced anisotropies, providing a complete picture of this correlated electron system. The resulting roadmap to symmetry breaking paves the way for deterministic engineering of fractional quantum Hall states, while our layer-resolved technique is readily extendable to other two-dimensional materials where layer polarization maps to the valley or spin quantum numbers.},

@article{Hunt13,
	abstract = {The remarkable transport properties of graphene, such as the high electron mobility, make it a promising material for electronics. However, unlike semiconductors such as silicon, graphene{\textquoteright}s electronic structure lacks a band gap, and a transistor made out of graphene would not have an {\textquotedblleft}off{\textquotedblright} state. Hunt et al. (p. 1427, published online 16 May; see the Perspective by Fuhrer) modulated the electronic properties of graphene by building a heterostructure consisting of a graphene flake resting on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which has the same honeycomb structure as graphene, but consists of alternating boron and nitrogen atoms instead of carbons. The natural mismatch between the graphene and hBN lattices led to a moire pattern with a large wavelength, causing the opening of a band gap, the formation of an elusive fractional quantum Hall state, and, at high magnetic fields, a fractal phenomenon in the electronic structure called the Hofstadter butterfly. van der Waals heterostructures constitute a new class of artificial materials formed by stacking atomically thin planar crystals. We demonstrated band structure engineering in a van der Waals heterostructure composed of a monolayer graphene flake coupled to a rotationally aligned hexagonal boron nitride substrate. The spatially varying interlayer atomic registry results in both a local breaking of the carbon sublattice symmetry and a long-range moir{\'e} superlattice potential in the graphene. In our samples, this interplay between short- and long-wavelength effects resulted in a band structure described by isolated superlattice minibands and an unexpectedly large band gap at charge neutrality. This picture is confirmed by our observation of fractional quantum Hall states at {\textpm}53 filling and features associated with the Hofstadter butterfly at ultrahigh magnetic fields.},

The mean-field model of composite fermions is unsatisfactory for the qualitative physics at high angular momenta.Extensive numerical calculations demonstrate that the microscopic CF theory, which incorporates interactions between composite fermions, provides an excellent qualitative and quantitative account of the quantum dot ground state down to the largest angular momenta studied, and allows systematic improvements by inclusion of mixing between composite fermion Landau levels (called $\Lambda$ levels).},

	abstract = {It has recently been pointed out that phases of matter with intrinsic topological order, like the fractional quantum Hall states, have an extra dynamical degree of freedom that corresponds to quantum geometry.

We perturb the system by a smooth, spatially dependent metric deformation and measure the response of the Hall fluid, finding it to be proportional to the Gaussian curvature of the metric. Further, we generalize the concept of coherent states to formulate the bulk off-diagonal long range order for the Laughlin state, and compute the deformations of the metric in the vicinity of the edge of the system. We introduce a `pair amplitude' operator and show that it can be used to numerically determine the intrinsic metric of the Laughlin state. These various probes are applied to several experimentally relevant settings that can expose the quantum geometry of the Laughlin state, in particular to systems with mass anisotropy and in the presence of an electric field gradient.},

@article{Kapfer19,
	abstract = {Anyons occur in two-dimensional electron systems as excitations with fractional charge in the topologically ordered states of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). Their dynamics are of utmost importance for topological quantum phases and possible decoherence free quantum information approaches, but observing these dynamics experimentally is challenging. Here we report on a dynamical property of anyons: the long predicted Josephson relation fJ=e*V/h for charges e*=e/3 and e/5, where e is the charge of the electron and h is Planck{\textquoteright}s constant. The relation manifests itself as marked signatures in the dependence of Photo Assisted Shot Noise (PASN) on voltage V when irradiating contacts at microwaves frequency fJ. The validation of FQHE PASN models indicates a path toward realizing time-resolved anyon sources based on levitons.},

@article{Kim19,
	abstract = {An important development in the field of the fractional quantum Hall effect was the proposal that the 5/2 state observed in the Landau level with orbital index n = 1 of two-dimensional electrons in a GaAs quantum well1 originates from a chiral p-wave paired state of composite fermions that are topological bound states of electrons and quantized vortices. The excitations of this state, which is theoretically described by a 'Pfaffian' wavefunction2 or its hole partner called the anti-Pfaffian3,4, are neither fermions nor bosons but Majorana quasiparticles obeying non-Abelian braid statistics5. This has inspired ideas for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation6 and has also instigated a search for other states with exotic quasiparticles. Here we report experiments on monolayer graphene that show clear evidence for unexpected even denominator fractional quantum Hall physics in the n = 3 Landau level. We numerically investigate the known candidate states for the even denominator fractional quantum Hall effect, including the Pfaffian, the particle-hole symmetric Pfaffian and the 221-parton states, and conclude that, among these, the 221-parton appears a potentially suitable candidate to describe the experimentally observed state. Like the Pfaffian, this state is believed to harbour quasi-particles with non-Abelian braid statistics7.},

@article{Kitaev01,
	abstract = {Certain one-dimensional Fermi systems have an
energy gap in the bulk spectrum while boundary states are
described by one Majorana operator per boundary point. A
finite system of length  L possesses two ground states with an
energy difference proportional to exp(-L/l0) and different
fermionic parities. Such systems can be used as qubits since
they are intrinsically immune to decoherence. The property of a
system to have boundary Majorana fermions is expressed as a
condition on the bulk electron spectrum. The condition is
satisfied in the presence of an arbitrary small energy gap
induced by proximity of a three-dimensional p-wave superconductor, provided that the normal spectrum has an odd
number of Fermi points in each half of the Brillouin zone (each
spin component counts separately).},

	abstract = {The interplay between strong Coulomb interactions and randomness has been a long-standing problem in condensed matter physics. According to the scaling theory of localization in two-dimensional systems of non-interacting or weakly interacting electrons, the ever-present randomness causes the resistance to rise as the temperature is decreased, leading to an insulating ground state. However, new evidence has emerged within the past decade indicating a transition from the insulating to metallic phase in two-dimensional systems of strongly interacting electrons. We review earlier experiments that demonstrate the unexpected presence of a metallic phase in two dimensions, and present an overview of recent experiments with emphasis on the anomalous magnetic properties that have been observed in the vicinity of the transition.},

	abstract = {Competition between liquid and solid states in two-dimensional electron systems is an intriguing problem in condensed matter physics. We have investigated competing Wigner crystal and fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid phases in atomically thin suspended graphene devices in Corbino geometry. Low-temperature magnetoconductance and transconductance measurements along with IV characteristics all indicate strong charge density dependent modulation of electron transport. Our results show unconventional FQH phases which do not fit the standard Jain's series for conventional FQH states, instead they appear to originate from residual interactions of composite fermions in partially filled Landau levels. Also at very low charge density with filling factors {\$}{\$}{\backslash}nu {\backslash},{\backslash}lesssim{\backslash}, 1/5{\$}{\$}, electrons crystallize into an ordered Wigner solid which eventually transforms into an incompressible Hall liquid at filling factors around $\nu${\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}1/7. Building on the unique Corbino sample structure, our experiments pave the way for enhanced understanding of the ordered phases of interacting electrons.},

@article{Leijnse12,
	abstract = {This short review paper provides a pedagogical introduction to the rapidly growing research field of Majorana fermions in topological superconductors. We first discuss in some detail the simplest `toy model' in which Majoranas appear, namely a one-dimensional tight-binding representation of a p-wave superconductor, introduced more than 10 years ago by Kitaev. We then give a general introduction to the remarkable properties of Majorana fermions in condensed matter systems, such as their intrinsically non-local nature and exotic exchange statistics, and explain why these quasiparticles are suspected to be especially well suited for low-decoherence quantum information processing. We also discuss the experimentally promising (and perhaps already successfully realized) possibility of creating topological superconductors using semiconductors with strong spin--orbit coupling, proximity-coupled to standard s-wave superconductors and exposed to a magnetic field. The goal is to provide an introduction to the subject for experimentalists or theorists who are new to the field, focusing on the aspects which are most important for understanding the basic physics. The text should be accessible for readers with a basic understanding of quantum mechanics and second quantization, and does not require knowledge of quantum field theory or topological states of matter.},

@article{Li17,
	abstract = {The unique Landau level spectrum of bilayer graphene (BLG) is predicted to support a non-Abelian even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state (FQHE) similar to the state first identified in GaAs. However, the nature of this state has remained difficult to characterize. Here we report transport measurements of a robust sequence of even denominator FQHE in dual gated BLG devices. Parallel field measurement confirms the spin-polarized nature of the ground state, consistent with the Pfaffian/anti-Pfaffian description. The sensitivity of the even denominator states to both filling fraction and transverse displacement field, provides new opportunities for tunability. Our results suggest that BLG is a platform where topological ground states with possible non-Abelian excitations can be manipulated and controlled.},

@article{Li19,
	abstract = {Heterostructures of vertically stacked graphene double layers, separated by a thin tunnel barrier, provide a highly tunable system to explore strongly interacting electron states. This is because the interlayer Coulomb interactions can be sensitively tuned simply by varying the barrier thickness. Recent studies of double-layer graphene have shown that, in the quantum Hall effect regime, strong interlayer coupling can induce electron-hole pairing across the two layers, resulting in a superfluid phase of interlayer excitons1-3. Here, we report a series of emergent fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states appearing under similar conditions. We find excellent agreement between the sequence of observable FQHE states and the theoretically proposed two-component composite-fermion (CF) model, where the CF quasiparticle construction results from both interlayer and intralayer interactions4,5. Most remarkably, we observe an additional series of incompressible states at fractional filling that do not fit within either the single- or two-component CF models. We interpret these states to result from residual pairing interactions between CFs, representing a new type of correlated ground state that is unique to graphene double-layer structures and not described by the conventional CF model.},

Three decades later, the field of {FQHE} is still active with new discoveries and new technical developments. A significant portion of attention in {FQHE} has been dedicated to filling factor 5/2 state, for its unusual even denominator and possible application in topological quantum computation. Traditionally, {FQHE} has been observed in high-mobility {GaAs} heterostructure, but new materials such as graphene also open up a new area for {FQHE}.

@article{Liu19,
	abstract = {When a strong magnetic field is applied to a two-dimensional electron system, interactions between the electrons can cause fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effects1,2. Bringing two two-dimensional conductors close to each other, a new set of correlated states can emerge due to interactions between electrons in the same and opposite layers3-6. Here we report interlayer-correlated FQH states in a device consisting of two parallel graphene layers separated by a thin insulator. Current flow in one layer generates different quantized Hall signals in the two layers. This result is interpreted using composite fermion (CF) theory7 with different intralayer and interlayer Chern-Simons gauge-field couplings. We observe FQH states corresponding to integer values of CF Landau level (LL) filling in both layers, as well as 'semiquantized' states, where a full CF LL couples to a continuously varying partially filled CF LL. We also find a quantized state between two coupled half-filled CF LLs and attribute it to an interlayer CF exciton condensate.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter explains the physics of noise, which in nanostructures is now one of the most exciting fields of mesoscopic physics. A motivation for this is the fact that as compared to a current measurement; additional information can be extracted from the noise. Noise has been computed and measured experimentally in a variety of systems, which are not all described in the chapter. The few examples of noise calculations presented in the chapter apply to situations where noise can either be characterized via the scattering theory or, for the case of a Luttinger liquid, via the perturbation theory in the tunneling Hamiltonian. Although this is a rather restrictive framework, these two situations can apply to a variety of nanodevices, possibly containing hybrid ferromagnetic or superconducting components. There exists a connection between noise and the dynamical Coulomb blockade, which has been established using the Keldysh formalism. It is well understood that when an electron tunnels through a single junction, the electromagnetic environment surrounding the junction has to be reorganized.},

	abstract = {We review the electronic properties of bilayer graphene, beginning with a description of the tight-binding model of bilayer graphene and the derivation of the effective Hamiltonian describing massive chiral quasiparticles in two parabolic bands at low energies. We take into account five tight-binding parameters of the Slonczewski--Weiss--McClure model of bulk graphite plus intra- and interlayer asymmetry between atomic sites which induce band gaps in the low-energy spectrum. The Hartree model of screening and band-gap opening due to interlayer asymmetry in the presence of external gates is presented. The tight-binding model is used to describe optical and transport properties including the integer quantum Hall effect, and we also discuss orbital magnetism, phonons and the influence of strain on electronic properties. We conclude with an overview of electronic interaction effects.},

@article{Meyer16,
	abstract = {The formalism of composite fermions (CFs) has been one of the most prominent and successful approaches to describing the fractional quantum Hall effect, in terms of trial many-body wave functions. Testing the accuracy of the latter typically involves rather heavy numerical comparison to exact diagonalization results. Thus, optimizing computational efficiency has been an important technical issue in this field. One generic (and not yet fully understood) property of the CF approach is that it tends to overcount the number of linearly independent candidate states for fixed sets of quantum numbers. Technically speaking, CF Slater determinants that are orthogonal before projection to the lowest Landau level, may lead to wave functions that are identical, or possess linear dependencies, after projection. This leads to unnecessary computations, and has been pointed out in the literature both for fermionic and bosonic systems. We here present a systematic approach that enables us to reveal all linear dependencies between bosonic compact states in the lowest CF `cyclotron energy' sub-band, and almost all dependencies in higher sub-bands, at the level of the CF Slater determinants, i.e. before projection, which implies a major computational simplification. Our approach is introduced for so-called simple states of two-species rotating bosons, and then generalized to generic compact bosonic states, both one- and two-species. Some perspectives also apply to fermionic systems. The identities and linear dependencies we find, are analytically exact for `brute force' projection in the disk geometry.},

@article{Mulay16,
	abstract = {A trial wave function Ψ(1, 2,..., N ) of an N electron system can always be written as the product of an antisymmetric Fermion factor F { z ij } = Π i<j z ij , and a symmetric correlation factor G { z ij }. F results from the Pauli principle, and G is caused by Coulomb interactions. One can represent G diagrammatically [1] by distributing N points on the circumference of a circle, and drawing appropriate lines representing correlation factors (cfs) z ij between pairs. Here, of course, z ij = z i -- z j , where z i is the complex coordinate of the i th electron. Laughlin correlations for the ν = 1/3 filled incompressible quantum liquid (IQL) state contain two cfs connecting each pair ( i,j ). For the Moore-Read state of the half-filled excited Landau level (LL), with ν = 2 + 1/2, the even value of N for the half-filled LL is partitioned into two subsets A and B , each containing N /2 electrons [2]. For any one partition ( A,B ), the contribution to G is given by G AB = Π i<j∈A z ij 2 Π k<ι∈B z kι 2 . The full G is equal to the symmetric sum of contributions G AB over all possible partitions of N into two subsets of equal size. For Jain states at filling factor ν = p/q < 1/2, the value of the single particle angular momentum ι satisfies the equation 2 ι = ν -1 N - C ν , with C ν = q + 1 - p . The values of (2 ι, N ) define the function space of G { z ij } , which must satisfy a number of conditions. For example, the highest power of any z i cannot exceed 2 ι + 1 - N . In addition, the value of the total angular momentum L of the lowest correlated state must satisfy the equation L = ( N /2)(2 ι +1 - N ) - K G , where K G is the degree of the homogeneous polynomial generated by G . Knowing the values of L for IQL states (and for states containing a few quasielectrons or a few quasiholes) from Jain's mean field CF picture allows one to determine K G . The dependence of the pair pseudopotential V(L 2 ) on pair angular momentum L 2 suggests a small number of correlation diagrams for a given value of the total angular momentum L . Correlation diagrams and correlation functions for the Jain state at ν = 2/5 and for the Moore-Read states will be presented as examples. The generalizations of the method of selecting G from small to larger systems will be discussed.},

The Laughlin fluid becomes unstable to these states in quantum wells whose thickness exceeds a critical value which depends on the electron density. The order parameter at 1/3 reduced density resembles that of a nematic liquid crystal, in that a residual twofold rotation axis is present in the low-symmetry phase. At filling factors 1/5 and 1/7, there are states with fourfold and sixfold axes, as well. We discuss the experimental detection of these phases.},

We report on the creation of an ultracold dense gas of potassium-rubidium (40K87Rb) polar molecules. Using a single step of STIRAP (stimulated Raman adiabatic passage) with two-frequency laser irradiation, we coherently transfer extremely weakly bound KRb molecules to the rovibrational ground state of either the triplet or the singlet electronic ground molecular potential. The polar molecular gas has a peak density of 1012 per cubic centimeter and an expansion-determined translational temperature of 350 nanokelvin. The polar molecules have a permanent electric dipole moment, which we measure with Stark spectroscopy to be 0.052(2) Debye (1 Debye = 3.336 × 10--30 coulomb-meters) for the triplet rovibrational ground state and 0.566(17) Debye for the singlet rovibrational ground state.},

@article{Ofek10,
	abstract = {Interference of edge channels is expected to be a prominent tool for studying statistics of charged quasiparticles in the quantum Hall effect (QHE). We present here a detailed study of an electronic Fabry--Perot interferometer (FPI) operating in the QHE regime [C. Chamon, et al. (1997) Phys Rev B 55:2331--2334], with the phase of the interfering quasiparticles controlled by the Aharonov--Bohm effect. Our main finding is that Coulomb interactions among the electrons dominate the interference, even in a relatively large area FPI, leading to a strong dependence of the area enclosed by the interference loop on the magnetic field. In particular, for a composite edge structure, with a few independent edge channels propagating along the edge, interference of the outmost edge channel (belonging to the lowest Landau level) was insensitive to magnetic field---suggesting a constant enclosed flux. However, when any of the inner edge channels interfered, the enclosed flux decreased when the magnetic field increased. By intentionally varying the enclosed area with a biased metallic gate and observing the periodicity of the interference pattern, charges e (for integer filling factors) and e/3 (for a fractional filling factor) were found to be expelled from the FPI. Moreover, these observations provided also a novel way of detecting the charge of the interfering quasiparticles.},

The construction is given by a generalization of the recent argument [M.O., T. Senthil, Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 (2006) 060601] which relates fractionalization and topological order. The nontrivial groundstate degeneracy obtained by Read and Green [Phys. Rev. B 61 (2000) 10267] based on differential geometry is reproduced exactly. Some restrictions on the statistics, due to the fractional charge of the quasiparticle are also discussed. Furthermore, the groundstate degeneracy of the p+ip superconductor in two dimensions, which is closely related to the Pfaffian states, is discussed with a similar construction.},

The electron density can be tuned from n=0--7.6×1011cm−2 with a peak mobility μ=5.5×106cm2Vs−1. The ν=5/2 state shows a strong minimum in diagonal resistance and a developing Hall plateau at magnetic fields (B) as high as 12.6T. The strength of the energy gap varies smoothly with B-field.

	abstract = {Charged excitons of composite fermions (CFs) are considered in the fractional quantum Hall effect. Energies of the charged \{CF\} excitons are computed at ν=1/3 as a function of the size of exciton. Our study suggests that the charged \{CF\} exciton with the size of a roton is lower in energy than the unbound state of a neutral roton and a lone charge. Therefore, we propose that the lowest-energy excitation of the fractional quantum Hall effect is in fact due to the charged excitons of composite fermions composed of two CF-particles and one CF-hole. The experimental relevance of the charged excitons of composite fermions is explored in the context of the resonant inelastic light scattering experiments.},

	abstract = {We review some theoretical progress towards understanding the origin of the fractional quantum Hall effect at filling factor 5/2 using numerical techniques. The leading candidate thought to describe the physics is the Moore-Read Pfaffian state which supports non-abelian anyonic excitations. Interestingly, these excitations have possible applications in topologically protected quantum information processing. Specifically, we discuss how the finite-thickness of realistic quasi-two-dimensional systems stabilizes the Moore-Read Pfaffian in the fractional quantum Hall effect at 5/2 and the use of bilayer systems in the second Landau level to investigate the possible quantum phase transition between abelian and non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states.},

In experiments at finite light scattering wave vectors |k|=k⩽0.15 l0−1, where l0 is the magnetic length, we find strong light scattering by the collective gap mode of the fractional quantum Hall liquid. Long wavelength spin waves also become allowed in the tilted-field configuration of the present experiments. Such measurements enable the exploration of dispersive charge- and spin-excitations. The energies of the long wavelength collective gap mode at ν=13 display a square-root dependence on perpendicular magnetic field in agreement with current theories of the incompressible quantum fluid. We also consider weaker spectra assigned to light scattering by large wave vector spin wave and collective gap excitation modes. These features are associated with breakdown of wave vector conservation in resonant inelastic light scattering.},

	abstract = {We present a theory of the metal-insulator transition in a disordered two-dimensional electron gas. A quantum critical point, separating the metallic phase, which is stabilized by electronic interactions, from the insulating phase, where disorder prevails over the electronic interactions, has been identified. The existence of the quantum critical point leads to a divergence in the density of states of the underlying collective modes at the transition, causing the thermodynamic properties to behave critically as the transition is approached. We show that the interplay of electron-electron interactions and disorder can explain the observed transport properties and the anomalous enhancement of the spin susceptibility near the metal-insulator transition.},

@article{Quinn09,
	abstract = {The correlations that give rise to incompressible quantum liquid (IQL) states in fractional quantum Hall systems are determined by the pseudopotential V ( R ) describing the interaction of a pair of Fermions in a degenerate Landau level (LL) as a function of relative pair angular momentum R . V ( R ) is known for a number of different Fermion systems, e.g. electrons in the lowest Landau level (LL0) or the first excited Landau level (LL1), and for quasiparticles of Laughlin--Jain \{IQL\} states. Laughlin correlations, the avoidance of pair states with the smallest values of R , occur only when V ( R ) satisfies certain conditions. We show that Jain's composite Fermion (CF) picture is valid only if the conditions necessary for Laughlin correlations are satisfied, and we present a rigorous justification of the \{CF\} picture without the need of introducing an ``irrelevant'' mean-field energy scale. Electrons in \{LL1\} and quasielectrons in \{IQL\} states (e.g. QEs in \{CF\} LL1) do not necessarily support Laughlin correlations. Numerical diagonalization studies for small systems of Fermions (electrons in \{LL0\} or in LL1, and \{QEs\} in \{CF\} LL1), with the use of appropriate pseudopotentials V ( R ) , show clear evidence for different types of correlations. The relation between \{LL\} degeneracy g = 2 ℓ + 1 and number of Fermions N at which \{IQL\} states are found is known for a limited range of N values. However, no simple intuitive models that we have tried satisfactorily describe all of the systems we have studied. Successes and shortcomings of some simple models are discussed, and suggestions for further investigation are made.},

The next topic that we will study is a specific exactly solvable model, called the toric code model, whose excitations have (mutual) anyon statistics. Then we will go on to discuss non-abelian anyons, where we will use the one dimensional Kitaev model as a prototypical example to produce Majorana modes at the edge. We will then explicitly derive the non-abelian unitary matrices under exchange of these Majorana modes.},

	abstract = {The fractional quantized Hall state at the filling factor $\ensuremath{\nu}=5/2$ is of special interest due to its possible application for quantum computing. Here we report on the optimization of growth parameters that allowed us to produce two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) with a 5/2 gap energy up to 135 mK. We concentrated on optimizing the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth to provide high 5/2 gap energies in `as-grown' samples, without the need to enhance the 2DEGs properties by illumination or gating techniques. Our findings allow us to analyse the impact of doping in narrow quantum wells with respect to conventional DX-doping in AlxGa1−xAs. The impact of the setback distance between doping layer and 2DEG was investigated as well. Additionally, we found a considerable increase in gap energy by reducing the amount of background impurities. To this end growth techniques like temperature reductions for substrate and effusion cells and the reduction of the Al mole fraction in the 2DEG region were applied.},

	abstract = {We study a system of anyons on a torus, which are defined as nonrelativistic particles, and can be either bosons or fermions, coupled to a U(1) Chern-Simons field representing the dynamics of an intermediate statistics superposed to the original one. In the case of bosons we find the exact ground state for given total momentum, in the case of fermions we succeed in finding all the momentum and energy eigenstates of a translationally invariant mean field hamiltonian, which approximates the exact one for high densities. In the latter case we find particular momentum eigenstates, for which the energy has a sharp minimum, representing macroscopically quantized motions of the anyon fluid along a handle, which have the features of supercurrents. We also compute the corresponding magnetic field.},

Since the distinction between the modular S-matrix S and −S has both topological and physical significance, so in our convention there are a total of 70 UMTCs of rank ≤ 4. In particular, there are two trivial UMTCs with S = ({\textpm}1). Each such UMTC can be obtained from 10 non-trivial prime UMTCs by direct product, and some symmetry operations. Explicit data of the 10 non-trivial prime UMTCs are given in Sect. 5. Relevance of UMTCs to topological quantum computation and various conjectures are given in Sect. 6.},

	abstract = {The proposals for realizing exotic particles through coupling of quantum Hall effect to superconductivity involve spatially non-uniform magnetic fields. As a step toward that goal, we study, both theoretically and experimentally, a system of Dirac electrons exposed to an Abrikosov flux lattice. We theoretically find that the non-uniform magnetic field causes a carrier-density--dependent reduction of the Hall conductivity. Our studies show that this reduction originates from a rather subtle effect: a levitation of the Berry curvature within Landau levels broadened by the non-uniform magnetic field. Experimentally, we measure the magneto-transport in a monolayer graphene-hexagonal boron nitride-niobium diselenide (NbSe2) heterostructure, and find a density-dependent reduction of the Hall resistivity of graphene as the temperature is lowered from above the superconducting critical temperature of NbSe2, when the magnetic field is uniform, to below, where the magnetic field bunches into an Abrikosov flux lattice.},

@article{Shi19,
	abstract = {Monolayer semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent a unique class of two-dimensional (2D) electron systems. Their atomically thin structure facilitates gate tunability just like graphene does, but unlike graphene, TMDs have the advantage of a sizable band gap and strong spin--orbit coupling. Measurements under large magnetic fields have revealed an unusual Landau level (LL) structure1--3, distinct from other 2D electron systems. However, owing to the limited sample quality and poor electrical contact, probing the lowest LLs has been challenging, and observation of electron correlations within the fractionally filled LL regime has not been possible. Here, through bulk electronic compressibility measurements, we investigate the LL structure of monolayer WSe2 in the extreme quantum limit, and observe fractional quantum Hall states in the lowest three LLs. The odd-denominator fractional quantum Hall sequences demonstrate a systematic evolution with the LL orbital index, consistent with generic theoretical expectations. In addition, we observe an even-denominator state in the second LL that is expected to host non-Abelian statistics. Our results suggest that the 2D semiconductors can provide an experimental platform that closely resembles idealized theoretical models in the quantum Hall regime.},

abstract={Strong interactions and topology drive a wide variety of correlated ground states. Some of the most interesting of these ground states, such as fractional quantum Hall states and fractional Chern insulators, have fractionally charged quasiparticles. Correlations in these phases are captured by the binding of electrons and vortices into emergent particles called composite fermions. Composite fermion quasiparticles are randomly localized at high levels of disorder and may exhibit charge order when there is not too much disorder in the system. However, more complex correlations are predicted when composite fermion quasiparticles cluster into a bubble, and then these bubbles order on a lattice. Such a highly correlated ground state is termed the bubble phase of composite fermions. Here we report the observation of such a bubble phase of composite fermions, evidenced by the re-entrance of the fractional quantum Hall effect. We associate this re-entrance with a bubble phase with two composite fermion quasiparticles per bubble. Our results demonstrate the existence of a new class of strongly correlated topological phases driven by clustering and charge ordering of emergent quasiparticles.},

	abstract = {The universal quantization of thermal conductance provides information on a state{\textquoteright}s topological order. Recent measurements revealed that the observed value of thermal conductance of the 52 state is inconsistent with either Pfaffian or anti-Pfaffian model, motivating several theoretical articles. Analysis has been made complicated by the presence of counter-propagating edge channels arising from edge reconstruction, an inevitable consequence of separating the dopant layer from the GaAs quantum well and the resulting soft confining potential. Here, we measured thermal conductance in graphene with atomically sharp confining potential by using sensitive noise thermometry on hexagonal boron-nitride encapsulated graphene devices, gated by either SiO2/Si or graphite back gate. We find the quantization of thermal conductance within 5\% accuracy for ν = 1;43;2 and 6 plateaus, emphasizing the universality of flow of information. These graphene quantum Hall thermal transport measurements will allow new insight into exotic systems like even-denominator quantum Hall fractions in graphene.},

@article{Stanescu13,
	abstract = {After a recent series of rapid and exciting developments, the long  search for the Majorana fermion---the elusive quantum entity at the border between particles and antiparticles---has produced the first positive experimental results, but is not over yet. Originally proposed by E Majorana in the context of particle physics, Majorana fermions have a condensed matter analogue in the zero-energy bound states emerging in topological superconductors. A promising route to engineering topological superconductors capable of hosting Majorana zero modes consists of proximity coupling semiconductor thin films or nanowires with strong spin--orbit interaction to conventional s-wave superconductors in the presence of an external Zeeman field. The Majorana zero mode is predicted to emerge above a certain critical Zeeman field as a zero-energy state localized near the order parameter defects, namely, vortices for thin films and wire ends for the nanowire. These Majorana bound states are expected to manifest non-Abelian quantum statistics, which makes them ideal building blocks for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. This review provides an update on the current status of the search for Majorana fermions in semiconductor nanowires by focusing on the recent developments, in particular the period following the first reports of experimental signatures consistent with the realization of Majorana bound states in semiconductor nanowire--superconductor hybrid structures. We start with a discussion of the fundamental aspects of the subject, followed by considerations on the realistic modeling, which is a critical bridge between theoretical predictions based on idealized conditions and the real world, as probed experimentally. The last part is dedicated to a few intriguing issues that were brought to the fore by the recent encouraging experimental advances.},

	abstract = {The dichotomy between fermions and bosons is at the root of many physical phenomena, from metallic conduction of electricity to super-fluidity, and from the periodic table to coherent propagation of light. The dichotomy originates from the symmetry of the quantum mechanical wave function to the interchange of two identical particles. In systems that are confined to two spatial dimensions particles that are neither fermions nor bosons, coined ``anyons'', may exist. The fractional quantum Hall effect offers an experimental system where this possibility is realized. In this paper we present the concept of anyons, we explain why the observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect almost forces the notion of anyons upon us, and we review several possible ways for a direct observation of the physics of anyons. Furthermore, we devote a large part of the paper to non-abelian anyons, motivating their existence from the point of view of trial wave functions, giving a simple exposition of their relation to conformal field theories, and reviewing several proposals for their direct observation.},

The general results of Hohenberg-Kohn-Mermin are confirmed by using local-scale point transformations. We show how to obtain a constructive and fully practical procedure for building up approximate functionals of the local density ϱ(r). The explicit form of these functionals and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are derived without assuming any particular form of the two-body forces. It is shown that the kinetic energy density contains only two terms: the original Weizs{\"a}cker term and nonlocality term. Special attention is paid to a formulation of the local density approach, whereby the temperature-dependent Hartree-Fock results are exactly reproduced.},

	abstract = {The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect at filling factor ? = 5/2 has recently come under close scrutiny, as its ground state may possess quasi-particle excitations obeying nonabelian statistics, a property sought for topologically protected quantum operations. However, its microscopic origin remains unknown, and candidate model wave functions include those with undesirable abelian statistics. We report direct measurements of the electron spin polarization of the ? = 5/2 FQH state using resistively detected nuclear magnetic resonance. We find the system to be fully polarized, which unambiguously rules out the most likely abelian contender and lends strong support for the ? = 5/2 state being nonabelian. Our measurements reveal an intrinsically different nature of interaction in the first excited Landau level underlying the physics at ? = 5/2.},

	abstract = {Computing the Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric matrix is a problem that arises in various fields of physics. Both computing the Pfaffian and a related problem, computing the canonical form of a skew-symmetric matrix under unitary congruence, can be solved easily once the skew-symmetric matrix has been reduced to skew-symmetric tridiagonal form. We develop efficient numerical methods for computing this tridiagonal form based on Gaussian elimination, using a skew-symmetric, blocked form of the Parlett-Reid algorithm, or based on unitary transformations, using block Householder transformations and Givens rotations, that are applicable to dense and banded matrices, respectively. We also give a complete and fully optimized implementation of these algorithms in Fortran (including a C interface), and also provide Python, Matlab and Mathematica implementations for convenience. Finally, we apply these methods to compute the topological charge of a class D nanowire, and show numerically the equivalence of definitions based on the Hamiltonian and the scattering matrix.},

We present evidence that the polarized Fermi sea of essentially non-interacting composite fermions remains stable against a pairing transition in both lowest Landau levels of graphene. However, it undergoes spontaneous depolarization, which in (ideal) graphene is unprotected for the lack of a single-particle pseudospin splitting. These results point to the absence of the non-Abelian Pfaffian phase in graphene.},

@article{Wang13,
	abstract = {Electrical contact to graphene is normally done with metal contacts on its flat face, where there are few strong bonding sites for the metal. Wang et al. (p. 614) encapsulated graphene with hexagonal boron nitride sheets and made metal contacts along its edge, where bonding orbitals are exposed. The resulting heterostructures had high electronic performance, with room-temperature carrier mobilities near the theoretical phonon-scattering limit.Heterostructures based on layering of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride represent a new class of electronic devices. Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary 2D materials.},

@article{Weniger08,
	abstract = {The transformation of a Laguerre series f ( z ) = ∑ ∞ n =0 λ (α) n L (α) n ( z ) to a power series f ( z ) = ∑ ∞ n =0 γ n z n is discussed. Since many nonanalytic functions can be expanded in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials, success is not guaranteed and such a transformation can easily lead to a mathematically meaningless expansion containing power series coefficients that are infinite in magnitude. Simple sufficient conditions based on the decay rates and sign patterns of the Laguerre series coefficients λ (α) n as n → ∞ can be formulated which guarantee that the resulting power series represents an analytic function. The transformation produces a mathematically meaningful result if the coefficients λ (α) n either decay exponentially or factorially as n → ∞. The situation is much more complicated---but also much more interesting---if the λ (α) n decay only algebraically as n → ∞. If the λ (α) n ultimately have the same sign, the series expansions for the power series coefficients diverge, and the corresponding function is not analytic at the origin. If the λ (α) n ultimately have strictly alternating signs, the series expansions for the power series coefficients still diverge, but are summable to something finite, and the resulting power series represents an analytic function. If algebraically decaying and ultimately alternating Laguerre series coefficients λ (α) n possess sufficiently simple explicit analytical expressions, the summation of the divergent series for the power series coefficients can often be accomplished with the help of analytic continuation formulae for hypergeometric series p +1 F p , but if the λ (α) n have a complicated structure or if only their numerical values are available, numerical summation techniques have to be employed. It is shown that certain nonlinear sequence transformations---in particular the so-called delta transformation (Weniger 1989 Comput. Phys. Rep. 10 189--371 (equation (8.4-4)))---are able to sum the divergent series occurring in this context effectively. As a physical application of the results of this paper, the legitimacy of the rearrangement of certain one-range addition theorems for Slater-type functions (Guseinov 1980 Phy. Rev. A 22 369--71, Guseinov 2001 Int. J. Quantum Chem. 81 126--29, Guseinov 2002 Int. J. Quantum Chem. 90 114--8) is investigated.},

@article{Willett09,
	abstract = {A standing problem in low-dimensional electron systems is the nature of the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state: Its elementary excitations are a focus for both elucidating the state's properties and as candidates in methods to perform topological quantum computation. Interferometric devices may be used to manipulate and measure quantum Hall edge excitations. Here we use a small-area edge state interferometer designed to observe quasiparticle interference effects. Oscillations consistent in detail with the Aharonov--Bohm effect are observed for integer quantum Hall and FQH states (filling factors ν = 2, 5/3, and 7/3) with periods corresponding to their respective charges and magnetic field positions. With these factors as charge calibrations, periodic transmission through the device consistent with quasiparticle charge e/4 is observed at ν = 5/2 and at lowest temperatures. The principal finding of this work is that, in addition to these e/4 oscillations, periodic structures corresponding to e/2 are also observed at 5/2 ν and at lowest temperatures. Properties of the e/4 and e/2 oscillations are examined with the device sensitivity sufficient to observe temperature evolution of the 5/2 quasiparticle interference. In the model of quasiparticle interference, this presence of an effective e/2 period may empirically reflect an e/2 quasiparticle charge or may reflect multiple passes of the e/4 quasiparticle around the interferometer. These results are discussed within a picture of e/4 quasiparticle excitations potentially possessing non-Abelian statistics. These studies demonstrate the capacity to perform interferometry on 5/2 excitations and reveal properties important for understanding this state and its excitations.},

@article{Xu14,
	abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator (TI) is a quantum state of matter with a gapped insulating bulk yet a conducting surface hosting topologically protected gapless surface states. One of the most distinct electronic transport signatures predicted for such topological surface states (TSS) is a well-defined half-integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) in a magnetic field, where the surface Hall conductivities become quantized in units of (1/2)e2/h (e being the electron charge, h the Planck constant) concomitant with vanishing resistance. Here, we observe a well-developed QHE arising from TSS in an intrinsic TI of BiSbTeSe2. Our samples exhibit surface-dominated conduction even close to room temperature, whereas the bulk conduction is negligible. At low temperatures and high magnetic fields perpendicular to the top and bottom surfaces, we observe well-developed integer quantized Hall plateaux, where the two parallel surfaces each contribute a half-integer e2/h quantized Hall conductance, accompanied by vanishing longitudinal resistance. When the bottom surface is gated to match the top surface in carrier density, only odd integer QH plateaux are observed, representing a half-integer QHE of two degenerate Dirac gases. This system provides an excellent platform to pursue a plethora of exotic physics and novel device applications predicted for TIs, ranging from magnetic monopoles and Majorana particles to dissipationless electronics and fault-tolerant quantum computers.},

	abstract = {Classical constraints on the reduced density matrix of quantum fluids in a single Landau level termed as local exclusion conditions (LECs) (Yang 2019 Phys. Rev. B 100 241302), have recently been shown to characterize the ground state of many fractional quantum Hall (FQH) phases. In this work, we extend the LEC construction to build the elementary excitations, namely quasiholes and quasielectrons, of these FQH phases. In particular, we elucidate the quasihole counting, categorize various types of quasielectrons, and construct their microscopic wave functions. Our extensive numerical calculations indicate that the undressed quasielectron excitations of the Laughlin state obtained from LECs are topologically equivalent to those obtained from the composite fermion theory. Intriguingly, the LEC construction unveils interesting connections between different FQH phases and offers a novel perspective on exotic states such as the Gaffnian and the Fibonacci state.},

@article{Yoo19,
	abstract = {Measurement of the ground-state spin polarization of quantum systems offers great potential for the discovery and characterization of correlated electronic states. However, spin polarization measurements have mainly involved optical1--3 and NMR4,5 techniques that perturb the delicate ground states and, for quantum Hall systems, have provided conflicting results1,4,6. Here we present spin-resolved pulsed tunnelling (SRPT) that precisely determines the phase diagram of the ground-state spin polarization as a function of magnetic field and Landau level (LL) filling factor ($\nu$) with negligible perturbation to the system. Our phase diagram shows a variety of polarized, unpolarized and topological spin states in the lowest (N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0) LL, which can largely be described by a weakly interacting composite fermion (CF) model7. However, the phase diagram shows unexpected behaviour in the N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}1 LL. We observe fully polarized $\nu${\thinspace}={\thinspace}5/2 and 8/3 states but a partially depolarized $\nu${\thinspace}={\thinspace}7/3 state. This behaviour deviates from the conventional theoretical picture7,8 of weakly interacting fractional quasiparticles, but instead suggests unusual electronic correlations and the possibility of new non-Abelian phases9--11. The results establish SRPT as a powerful technique for investigating correlated electron phenomena.},

But a new system makes it possible to detect spin directly, allowing NMR measurements on a nanoscale sample on a semiconductor chip. It also provides tighter control over nuclei than conventional NMR, so can probe nuclei containing multiple spin levels, one of the systems that can be used in quantum computing.},

	abstract = {We construct a density functional theory for two-dimensional electron (hole) gases subjected to both strong magnetic fields and external potentials. In particular, we are focused on regimes near even-denominator filling factors, in which the systems form composite fermion liquids. Our theory provides a systematic and rigorous approach to determine the properties of ground states in a fractional quantum {Hall} regime that is modified by artificial structures. We also propose a practical way to construct an approximated functional.},

@article{Zibrov17,
	abstract = {In monolayer graphene, the two inequivalent sublattices of carbon atoms combine with the electron spin to give electrons a nearly fourfold degenerate internal isospin. At high magnetic fields, the isospin degeneracy increases the already large intrinsic degeneracy of the two-dimensional Landau levels, making low-disorder graphene systems a versatile platform for studying multicomponent quantum magnetism. Here, we describe magnetocapacitance experiments of ultraclean monolayer graphene devices in which a hexagonal boron nitride substrate breaks the symmetry between carbon sublattices. We observe a phase transition in the isospin system, which is marked by unusual transitions in odd-denominator fractional quantum Hall states for filling factors n near charge neutrality and by the unexpected appearance of incompressible even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states at n = {\textpm}1/2 and n = {\textpm}1/4. We propose a scenario in which the observed states are multicomponent fractional quantum Hall states incorporating correlations between electrons on different carbon sublattices, associated with a quantum Hall analogue of the N{\'e}el-to-valence bond solid transition that occurs at charge neutrality.},
