\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose \texttt{ArtiFusion}, the first attempt at a diffusion-based artifact restoration framework for histology images. 
% 
With a novel Swin-Transformer denoising backbone, \texttt{ArtiFusion} is able to restore regional artifacts using the context information, while preserving the tissue structures in artifact-free regions as well as the stain style. 
% 
Experimental results on a public histological dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art GAN counterpart. 
% 
Consequently, we believe that our proposed method has the potential to benefit the medical community by enabling more accurate diagnosis or treatment planning as a pre-processing method for histology analysis. 
% 
Future work includes investigating the extension of \texttt{ArtiFusion} to more advanced diffusion models such as score-based or score-SDE models~\cite{yang2022diffusion}.
