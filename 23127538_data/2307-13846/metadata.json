  "abstract": "The ``ugly duckling'' of the Segré-Plebański-Hawking-Ellis classification of stress-energy tensors is believed to be either impossible or extremely difficult to realise in Einstein gravity. Effective stress-energy tensors in alternative gravity offer a wider range of possibilities. We report a class of type III realisations in ``first-generation'' scalar-tensor and in Horndeski gravity, and their physical interpretation. The ugly duckling may be a freak of nature of limited importance but it is not physically impossible.",
