  "abstract": "The NV$^-$ color center in diamond has been extensively investigated for quantum sensing, computation, and communication applications. Nonetheless, charge-state decay from the NV$^-$ to its neutral counterpart the NV$^0$ detrimentally affects the robustness of the NV$^-$ center and remains to be fully overcome. In this work, we provide an $ab~initio$ formalism for accurately estimating the rate of charge-state decay of color centers in wide-bandgap semiconductors. Our formalism employs density functional theory calculations in the context of thermal equilibrium. We illustrate the method using the transition of NV$^-$ to NV$^0$ in the presence of substitutional N [see Z. Yuan $et~al$., PRR 2, 033263 (2020)].",
