  "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the influence of perfect fluid dark matter and quantum corrections on the thermodynamics of non-linear magnetic-charged black hole. We consider the metric of the static non-linear magnetic-charged black hole in the background of perfect fluid dark matter. Starting with the black hole temperature and the corrected entropy, we use the event horizon propriety in order to find the temperature, and based on the surface gravity definition, we find the uncorrected entropy. However, using the definition of the corrected entropy due to thermal fluctuation, we find and plot the entropy of the black hole. We find that the entropy is highly affected for smaller non-linear magnetic-charged black holes. Afterwards, we study the thermodynamic stability of the black hole by computing and plotting the evolution of heat capacity. The results show that second-order phase transition occurs, which appears more later as the dark matter parameter decreases, and leads the black hole to move from the stable phase to the unstable phase. Furthermore, we show that the heat capacity for smaller black holes are also affected, since it appears not being only an increasing function.",
