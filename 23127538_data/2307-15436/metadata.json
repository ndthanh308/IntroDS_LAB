  "abstract": "Safety-critical systems such as those in automotive, avionics and space, require appropriate safety measures to avoid silent data corruption upon random hardware errors such as those caused by radiation and other types of electromagnetic interference. Those safety measures must be able to prevent faults from causing the so-called common cause failures (CCFs), which occur when a fault produces identical errors in redundant elements so that comparison fails to detect the errors and a failure arises. The usual solution to avoid CCFs in CPU cores is using lockstep cores, so that two cores execute the same flow of instructions, but with some time staggering so that their state is never identical and faults can only lead to different errors, which are then detectable by means of comparison. This paper extends Gaisler's RISC-V NOEL-V core with lockstep; and presents future prospects for its use and distribution.",
