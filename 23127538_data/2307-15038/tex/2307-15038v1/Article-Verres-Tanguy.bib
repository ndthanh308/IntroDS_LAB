observed in densified silica},

abstract = {Spectroscopic results on low-frequency excitations of densified silica are presented and related to characteristic thermal properties of glasses. The end of the longitudinal acoustic branch is marked by a rapid increase of the Brillouin linewidth with the scattering vector. This rapid growth saturates at a crossover frequency Ωco which nearly coincides with the centre of the boson peak. The latter is clearly due to additional optic-like excitations related to nearly rigid SiO4 librations as indicated by hyper-Raman scattering. Whether the onset of strong scattering is best described as resulting from hybridization of acoustic modes with these librations, from their elastic scattering (Rayleigh scattering) on the local excitations, or from soft potentials remains to be established.},

abstract = {According to the shoving model the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of supercooled liquids' relaxation time (or viscosity) derives from the fact that the high-frequency shear modulus is temperature dependent in the supercooled phase, often increasing a factor of three or four in the temperature interval over which the relaxation time increases by ten to fifteen decades. In this paper we have compiled all tests of the shoving model known to us. These involve rheological data obtained by different techniques, high-frequency sound-wave data, neutron scattering data for the vibrational mean-square displacement, data obtained at or below the glass transition, as well as data testing the model under out-of-equilibrium conditions, i.e., during aging. Most data confirm the model, some do not. We conclude that more work is needed to precisely characterize the model's range of applicability.},

abstract = {An overview of relaxational phenomenology is given in a manner intended to highlight a number of the important problems which, notwithstanding much recent sophisticated investigation, continue to confront the field. The rapidly lengthening timescale for diffusional and/or reorientational motion, which provokes the glass transition, is examined within the framework of the ‘strong’ and ‘fragile’ classification of both liquids and plastic crystals. The behavior patterns observed are related to the topological features of the potential energy hypersurfaces which may characterize each extreme. In view of the implication that the observed glass transition is the kinetically obscured reflection of an underlying higher order thermodynamic transition which could be associated with a diverging length scale (at least for fragile systems), the problem of the basic diffusional length scale at the glass transition, using a probe molecule approach, is considered. Then, details of the kinetics of relaxation under isothermal conditions are reviewed to decide on the range of deviations from Debye behavior which may be encountered. A correlation with fragility is strongly indicated. The phenomena of serial decoupling of relaxational modes from the main structural relaxation as Tg is approached is outlined and, finally, the additional phenomena that may be encountered in experiments that explore the state-dependence (or non-linearity) of relaxation are briefly examined.},

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {Density fluctuations in supercooled liquids near the glass transition relax in multiple steps. The short time relaxation is known as β-relaxation and the final long time relaxation is called α-relaxation. It is believed that the long time α-relaxation is a cooperative phenomena associated with a growing length scales, whereas the short-time β-relaxation is often attributed to spatially local processes involving the rattling motion of a particle in the transient cage formed by its neighbors. Using molecular dynamics simulations of few model glass-forming liquids, we show that the β-relaxation is also cooperative in nature and the length scale extracted from the detailed finite-size scaling analysis of β-relaxation is found to be the same as that of the length scale that describes the spatial heterogeneity of local dynamics in the long-time α-relaxation regime. These results provide a clear connection between short-time dynamics and long-time structural relaxation in glass-forming liquids.},

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {We derived a new method for direct calculation of the modal contributions to thermal conductivity, which is termed Green–Kubo modal analysis (GKMA). The GKMA method combines the lattice dynamics formalism with the Green–Kubo formula for thermal conductivity, such that the thermal conductivity becomes a direct summation of modal contributions, where one need not define the phonon velocity. As a result, the GKMA method can be applied to any material/group of atoms, where the atoms vibrate around stable equilibrium positions, which includes non-stoichiometric compounds, random alloys, amorphous materials and even rigid molecules. By using molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the time history of each mode’s contribution to the heat current, one naturally includes anharmonicity to full order and can obtain insight into the interactions between different modes through the cross-correlations. As an example, we applied the GMKA method to crystalline and amorphous silicon. The modal contributions at each frequency result from the analysis and thereby allow one to apply a quantum correction to the mode heat capacity to determine the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity. The predicted temperature dependent thermal conductivity for amorphous silicon shows the best agreement with experiments to date. The GKMA method provides new insight into the nature of phonon transport, as it casts the problem in terms of mode–mode correlation instead of scattering, and provides a general unified formalism that can be used to understand phonon–phonon interactions in essentially any class of materials or structures where the atoms vibrate around stable equilibrium sites.},

title = {The fluctuation-dissipation theorem},
journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
abstract = {The linear response theory has given a general proof of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem which states that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium. This theorem may be represented by a stochastic equation describing the fluctuation, which is a generalization of the familiar Langevin equation in the classical theory of Brownian motion. In this generalized equation the friction force becomes retarded or frequency-dependent and the random force is no more white. They are related to each other by a generalized Nyquist theorem which is in fact another expression of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This point of view can be applied to a wide class of irreversible process including collective modes in many-particle systems as has already been shown by Mori. As an illustrative example, the density response problem is briefly discussed.},

We consider simulations at different length scale and time scale. At the nanometer scale, we review studies based on atomistic simulations, with a particular emphasis on the role of the potential energy landscape and of the temperature. At the micrometer scale, we present the different mesoscopic models of amorphous plasticity and show the relation between shear banding and the type of disorder and correlations (e.g. elastic) included in the models. At the macroscopic range, we review the different constitutive laws used in finite-element simulations. We end with a critical discussion on the opportunities and challenges offered by multiscale modeling and information transfer between scales to study amorphous plasticity.},

abstract = {Structured metamaterials are at the core of extensive research, promising for acoustic and thermal engineering. Nevertheless, the computational cost required for correctly simulating large systems imposes to use a continuous model to describe the effective behavior without knowing the atomistic details. Crucially, a correct description needs to describe both the extrinsic interface-induced and the intrinsic atomic scale-originated phonon scattering, especially when the component material is made of glass, a highly dissipative material in which wave attenuation is strongly dependent on frequency as well as on temperature. In amorphous systems, the effective acoustic attenuation triggered by multiple mechanisms is now well characterized and exhibits a nontrivial frequency dependence with a double crossover of power laws. In this work, we propose a continuum viscoelastic model based on the hierarchical strategy multi-scale approach, able to reproduce well the phonon attenuation in a large frequency range, spanning three orders of magnitude from GHz to THz with a ω2−ω4−ω2 dependence, including the influence of temperature.},

ABSTRACT = {In this article, the effect on the vibrational and thermal properties of gradually interconnected nanoinclusions embedded in an amorphous silicon matrix is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The nanoinclusion arrangement ranges from an aligned sphere array to an interconnected mesh of nanowires. Wave-packet simulations scanning different polarizations and frequencies reveal that the interconnection of the nanoinclusions at constant volume fraction induces a strong increase of the mean free path of high frequency phonons, but does not affect the energy diffusivity. The mean free path and energy diffusivity are then used to estimate the thermal conductivity, showing an enhancement of the effective thermal conductivity due to the existence of crystalline structural interconnections. This enhancement is dominated by the ballistic transport of phonons. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations confirm the tendency, although less markedly. This leads to the observation that coherent energy propagation with a moderate increase of the thermal conductivity is possible. These findings could be useful for energy harvesting applications, thermal management or for mechanical information processing.},
