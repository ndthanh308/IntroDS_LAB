  "abstract": "Let $Ω^d$ be the $d$-dimensional Drinfeld symmetric space for a finite extension $F$ of $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. Let $Σ^1$ be a geometrically connected component of the first Drinfeld covering of $Ω^d$ and let $\\mathbb{F}$ be the residue field of the unique degree $d+1$ unramified extension of $F$. We show that the natural homomorphism determined by the second Drinfeld covering from the group of characters of $(\\mathbb{F}, +)$ to $\\text{Pic}(Σ^1)[p]$ is injective. In particular, $\\text{Pic}(Σ^1)[p] \\neq 0$. We also show that all vector bundles on $Ω^1$ are trivial, which extends the classical result that $\\text{Pic}(Ω^1) = 0$.",
