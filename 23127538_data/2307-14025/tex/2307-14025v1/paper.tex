\begin{abstract}
Diagnosing rare anemia disorders using microscopic images is challenging for skilled specialists and machine-learning methods alike.  
Due to thousands of disease-relevant cells in a single blood sample, this constitutes a complex multiple-instance learning (MIL) problem. 
While the spatial neighborhood of red blood cells is not meaningful per se, the topology, i.e., the geometry of blood samples as a whole, contains informative features to remedy typical MIL issues, such as vanishing gradients and overfitting when training on limited data. 

We thus develop a topology-based approach that extracts multi-scale topological features from bags of single red blood cell images.
The topological features are used to regularize the model, enforcing the preservation of characteristic topological properties of the data.
Applied to a dataset of 71 patients suffering from rare anemia disorders with 521 microscopic images of red blood cells, our experiments show that topological regularization is an effective method that leads to more than 3\% performance improvements for automated classification of rare anemia disorders based on  single-cell images. 
This is the first approach that uses topological properties for regularizing the MIL process.
