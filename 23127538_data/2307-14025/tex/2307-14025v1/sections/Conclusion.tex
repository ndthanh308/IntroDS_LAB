\section{Conclusion}
Our work introduces the first approach for preserving topological characteristics in image space while learning latent representations using deep neural networks for MIL. 
Our topologically-regularized loss, as measured by persistent homology, enhances the performance of data-hungry MIL models, especially when dealing with limited training data. 
This is demonstrated through our evaluation of the technique for classifying rare anemia disorders, which showed that preserving topological features significantly improves performance.

For future work, we will investigate other ways to describe image geometry and topology, using cubical complexes that can operate directly on images. We also plan to analyze the geometrical and topological properties of the spaces of bags, drawing on recent developments in metric geometry, such as the Gromov--Hausdorff distance used to characterize shapes in previous studies~\cite{Chazal09a}.
