\section{Conclusion}
%
We present TR-MIL, a novel approach to MIL frameworks, that leverages geometrical-topological properties of bags.
%
This is achieved by employing a topological regularization loss term within the MIL objective function. 
%
Our method ensures that intrinsic geometrical-topological characteristics of bags in the input space are consistently maintained in their latent projections.
%
Testing our approach on numerous datasets, We showed that this preservation leads to substantial improvements in terms of predictive performance and generalization performance, especially when dealing with scarce training data. 

As for future research directions, we plan to explore alternative methods for describing image geometry and topology, with a particular focus on cubical complexes that can directly operate on images. 
%
Additionally, we aim to investigate the geometrical and topological properties of bag spaces, leveraging recent advances in metric geometry, including the Gromov--Hausdorff distance, which has previously been utilized to characterize shapes in related studies~\cite{Chazal09a}.
