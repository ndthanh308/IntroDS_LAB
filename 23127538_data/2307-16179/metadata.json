  "abstract": "Since wearable technology was first conceptualized in 1960, it has become a crucial aspect of our daily life. People's daily lives have been made better and their health and well-being have improved because of its convenience, real-time, and efficiency, among other things. Haptic feedback and haptic-based cues are crucial tools to improve interaction when trying to improve user experience. An essential component of human-computer interface design that can be used to improve user experience is haptic feedback. By offering a more immersive interface, haptic feedback can improve the user experience. This paper attempts to better understand \"The role of haptic feedback in enhancing the user experience of wearable devices\" and the effects of haptic feedback on user engagement and interaction. The findings of this study are relevant to the developing fields of wearable technology and human-computer interaction. Wearable technologies can be made more intuitive, user-friendly, and immersive by considering how haptic feedback affects the user experience.",
