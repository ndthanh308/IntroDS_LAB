\section*{Ethical Considerations}
\paragraph{Privacy sensitive datasets.} Both the MIMIC-CXR dataset~\cite{Johnson:2019:SciData}, and the OpenI dataset~\cite{Demner-Fushman:2015:JAMIA} were fully de-identified by the dataset authors in compliance with applicable privacy laws (HIPAA).
This includes the removal of any protected health information that may directly or indirectly identify a patient.
Nevertheless, the data is still privacy sensitive, and special care was taken to only process it within secured computing infrastructure.

\paragraph{Intended use.} We believe that the proposed methods can improve the workflow of clinicians both by reducing the documentation effort and encouraging higher-quality reporting, and thereby improving patient care.
However, as our results and discussion show, state-of-the-art summarization methods may not have the desired level of quality that is needed in high-stakes domains such as the clinical context.
Therefore, our work is not to be understood in the context of a system that can be deployed, but rather as a step toward a better understanding of the shortcomings of current text summarization methods and providing insight into how these can solved.
