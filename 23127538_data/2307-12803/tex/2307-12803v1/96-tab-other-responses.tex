\midrule

\multicolumn{4}{l}{\emph{1. Incorrect findings: the finding in the reference is replaced with a different and incorrect finding.}} & 29 \\ \midrule

Finding &
incorrectness affects the main finding. &
no acute \textcolor{Orange}{intrathoracic} process. &
The reference uses ``\textcolor{Orange}{cardiopulmonary} process'' instead of ``\textcolor{Orange}{intrathoracic} process''. &
21 \\

Past state &
incorrectness affects a past state of the patient. &
\textcolor{Orange}{increased} opacity in the right lung.. &
The reference mentions that the opacity is \textcolor{Orange}{new} and did not exist before.  &
7 \\

Other &
incorrectness affects other aspects.  &
bilateral pleural \textcolor{Orange}{effusions},..., slightly improved... &
The \textcolor{Orange}{improvement} is used to describe a second finding in the reference.   &
1 \\\midrule

\multicolumn{4}{l}{\emph{2. Imprecise findings: the description of the finding or some of its aspects is imprecise compared to the reference.}} & 73 \\ \midrule

Finding &
the description of the finding itself is imprecise compared to the reference.  &
...no \textcolor{Orange}{displaced} fractures are seen. &
The reference uses ``\textcolor{Orange}{acute} fractures'' instead of ``\textcolor{Orange}{displaced} fractures'' (the reference is more general). &
21 \\

Location &
the location of the finding is imprecise.  &
retrocardiac opacity compatible with pneumonia... &
The references specifies the exact location: ``\textcolor{Orange}{Left lower lobe pneumonia}''. &
21 \\

Certainty &
the summary is presented with a different degree of certainty.  &
bilateral middle lobe opacities \textcolor{Orange}{could represent} atelectasis or pneumonia. &
The reference is certain about the finding.  &
9 \\

Repetition &
some findings are repeated. &
unchanged \textcolor{Orange}{bibasilar bronchiectasis} and \textcolor{Orange}{bibasilar bronchiectasis}. &
\textcolor{Orange}{bibasilar bronchiectasis} is mentioned twice. &
6 \\

Count &
the count in the finding is imprise. &
right pleural \textcolor{Orange}{effusion}. &
The reference adds ``Multiloculated'', i.e.,  ``\textcolor{Orange}{Multiloculated} right pleural effusion'' &
2 \\

Size &
the size of the finding is added/omitted/different. &
multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules \textcolor{Orange}{measuring up to 2. 5 cm}. &
The reference omits the size. &
1 \\

Other &
other aspects about the finding are imprecise. &
interval resolution of large right pleural effusion... &
The reference includes other clinical information. &
13 \\\midrule

\multicolumn{4}{l}{\emph{3. Minor/secondary: errors that do not affect the finding.}} & 21 \\\midrule

Limitation &
some limitations of the examination are (not) mentioned.  &
no definite acute cardiopulmonary process. &
The reference adds \textcolor{Orange}{``based on this limited, portable examination''}. &
15 \\

Phone calls &
The time of a telephone call is different.   &
...these findings were discussed with dr. \_ by \_ via \textcolor{Orange}{telephone on \_ at 4 : 45 pm}. &
The reference mentions a different time for the phone call. &
4 \\

Recommendation &
errors related to recommendations.  &
short radiographic follow up is recommended \textcolor{Orange}{within \_ weeks} to document resolution. &
The reference omits \textcolor{Orange}{``within \_ weeks''}.  &
2 \\
