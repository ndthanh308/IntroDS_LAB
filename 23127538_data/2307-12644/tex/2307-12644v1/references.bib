abstract = {Facial expression is central to human experience. Its efficiency and valid measurement are challenges that automated facial image analysis seeks to address. Most publically available databases are limited to 2D static images or video of posed facial behavior. Because posed and un-posed (aka “spontaneous”) facial expressions differ along several dimensions including complexity and timing, well-annotated video of un-posed facial behavior is needed. Moreover, because the face is a three-dimensional deformable object, 2D video may be insufficient, and therefore 3D video archives are required. We present a newly developed 3D video database of spontaneous facial expressions in a diverse group of young adults. Well-validated emotion inductions were used to elicit expressions of emotion and paralinguistic communication. Frame-level ground-truth for facial actions was obtained using the Facial Action Coding System. Facial features were tracked in both 2D and 3D domains. To the best of our knowledge, this new database is the first of its kind for the public. The work promotes the exploration of 3D spatiotemporal features in subtle facial expression, better understanding of the relation between pose and motion dynamics in facial action units, and deeper understanding of naturally occurring facial action.}

  abstract  = "Photoplethysmography imaging (PPGI) sensors have attracted a
               significant amount of attention as they enable the remote
               monitoring of heart rates (HRs) and thus do not require any
               additional devices to be worn on fingers or wrists. In this
               study, we mounted PPGI sensors on a robot for active and
               autonomous HR (R-AAH) estimation. We proposed an algorithm that
               provides accurate HR estimation, which can be performed in real
               time using vision and robot manipulation algorithms. By
               simplifying the extraction of facial skin images using
               saturation (S) values in the HSV color space, and selecting
               pixels based on the most frequent S value within the face image,
               we achieved a reliable HR assessment. The results of the
               proposed algorithm using the R-AAH method were evaluated by
               rigorous comparison with the results of existing algorithms on
               the UBFC-RPPG dataset (n = 42). The proposed algorithm yielded
               an average absolute error (AAE) of 0.71 beats per minute (bpm).
               The developed algorithm is simple, with a processing time of
               less than 1 s (275 ms for an 8-s window). The algorithm was
               further validated on our own dataset (BAMI-RPPG dataset [n =
               14]) with an AAE of 0.82 bpm.",

ABSTRACT = {UV radiation (UV) is classified as a “complete carcinogen” because it is both a mutagen and a non-specific damaging agent and has properties of both a tumor initiator and a tumor promoter. In environmental abundance, UV is the most important modifiable risk factor for skin cancer and many other environmentally-influenced skin disorders. However, UV also benefits human health by mediating natural synthesis of vitamin D and endorphins in the skin, therefore UV has complex and mixed effects on human health. Nonetheless, excessive exposure to UV carries profound health risks, including atrophy, pigmentary changes, wrinkling and malignancy. UV is epidemiologically and molecularly linked to the three most common types of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma, which together affect more than a million Americans annually. Genetic factors also influence risk of UV-mediated skin disease. Polymorphisms of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene, in particular, correlate with fairness of skin, UV sensitivity, and enhanced cancer risk. We are interested in developing UV-protective approaches based on a detailed understanding of molecular events that occur after UV exposure, focusing particularly on epidermal melanization and the role of the MC1R in genome maintenance.},
