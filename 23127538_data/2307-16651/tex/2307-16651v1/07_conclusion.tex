\section{Discussion}
While deep learning has strong potential in numerous healthcare applications, the quality and size of labeled datasets remain a significant problem due to the high cost and labor-intensive nature of data collection. Consequently, the majority of high-quality datasets with gold-standard labels are small-scale, making it challenging to train efficient and generalizable models. Using large-scale wearable sensing datasets with inaccurate labeling could enhance the performance of such tiny datasets' models. However, distribution shifts, such as cohort and task shifts, may also contribute to performance degradation during model generalization and validation.
In this work, we proposed the unlabeled domain adaptation via multi-discriminator adversarial training framework (\systemname{}) to address the problem by leveraging a large-scale noisy silver-standard dataset. Our proposed method alleviates the domain shift problem and improves the performance of the challenging CRF prediction task. 
Moreover, our method has substantial potential to be applied to various other healthcare scenarios that demonstrate similar characteristics. While we have not specifically explored these applications due to limited benchmark datasets, the robust performance of our method under various distribution shifts using diverse datasets, containing both real and semi-synthetic data between gold-standard and noisy labels, shows the proposed method has the ability to generalize. We believe that the proposed method is applicable to a multitude of healthcare domains such as sleep monitoring, continuous monitoring of chronic diseases, and mental health research
% Future work includes generalizing \systemname{} to other healthcare applications, especially regression tasks involving high-dimensional time series or wearable-sourced data.
