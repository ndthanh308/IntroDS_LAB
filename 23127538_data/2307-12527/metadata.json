  "abstract": "Liquid droplets hanging from solid surfaces are commonplace, but their physics is complex. Examples include dew or raindrops hanging onto wires or droplets accumulating onto a cover placed over warm food or windshields. In these scenarios, determining the force of detachment is crucial to rationally design technologies. Despite much research, a quantitative theoretical framework for detachment force remains elusive. In response, we interrogated the elemental droplet surface system via comprehensive laboratory and computational experiments. The results reveal that the Young Laplace equation can be utilized to accurately predict the droplet detachment force. When challenged against experiments with liquids of varying properties and droplet sizes, detaching from smooth and microtextured surfaces of wetting and non wetting chemical makeups, the predictions were in an excellent quantitative agreement. This study advances the current understanding of droplet physics and will contribute to the rational development of technologies.",
