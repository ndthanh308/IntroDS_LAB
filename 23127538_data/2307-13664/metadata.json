  "abstract": "For a symmetric Lie algebra $\\mathfrak g=\\mathfrak k\\oplus\\mathfrak p$ we consider a class of bilinear or more general control-affine systems on $\\mathfrak p$ defined by a drift vector field $X$ and control vector fields $\\mathrm{ad}_{k_i}$ for $k_i\\in\\mathfrak k$ such that one has fast and full control on the corresponding compact group $\\mathbf K$. We show that under quite general assumptions on $X$ such a control system is essentially equivalent to a natural reduced system on a maximal Abelian subspace $\\mathfrak a\\subseteq\\mathfrak p$, and likewise to related differential inclusions defined on $\\mathfrak a$. We derive a number of general results for such systems and as an application we prove a simulation result with respect to the preorder induced by the Weyl group action.",
