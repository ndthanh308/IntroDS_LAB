  "abstract": "A theorem of Gutt-Hutchings-Ramos asserts that all normalized symplectic capacities give the same value for monotone four-dimensional toric domains. We generalize this theorem to arbitrary dimension. The new ingredient in our proof is the construction of symplectic embeddings of \"$L$-shaped\" domains in any dimension into corresponding infinite cylinders; this resolves a conjecture of Gutt-Pereira-Ramos in the affirmative.",
