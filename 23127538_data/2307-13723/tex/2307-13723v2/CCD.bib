abstract = {Summary
The central engines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are powered by accreting supermassive black holes, and while AGNs are known to play an important role in galaxy evolution, the key physical processes occur on scales that are too small to be resolved spatially (aside from a few exceptional cases). Reverberation mapping is a powerful technique that overcomes this limitation by using echoes of light to determine the geometry and kinematics of the central regions. Variable ionizing radiation from close to the black hole drives correlated variability in surrounding gas/dust but with a time delay due to the light travel time between the regions, allowing reverberation mapping to effectively replace spatial resolution with time resolution. Reverberation mapping is used to measure black hole masses and to probe the innermost X-ray emitting region, the UV/optical accretion disk, the broad emission line region, and the dusty torus. In this article, we provide an overview of the technique and its varied applications.}

    abstract = { The discovery of pulsars opened a new research field that allows studying a wide range of physics under extreme conditions. More than 3,000 pulsars are currently known, including especially more than 200 of them studied at gamma-ray frequencies. By putting recent insights into the pulsar magnetosphere in a historical context and by comparing them to key observational features at radio and high-energy frequencies, we show the following: ▪ Magnetospheric structure of young energetic pulsars is now understood. Limitations still exist for old nonrecycled and millisecond pulsars. ▪ The observed high-energy radiation is likely produced in the magnetospheric current sheet beyond the light cylinder. ▪ There are at least two different radio emission mechanisms. One operates in the inner magnetosphere, whereas the other one works near the light cylinder and is specific to pulsars with the high magnetic field strength in that region. ▪ Radio emission from the inner magnetosphere is intrinsically connected to the process of pair production, and its observed properties contain the imprint of both the geometry and propagation effects through the magnetospheric plasma. We discuss the limitations of our understanding and identify a range of observed phenomena and physical processes that still await explanation in thefuture. This includes connecting the magnetospheric processes to spin-down properties to explain braking and possible evolution of spin orientation, building a first-principles model of radio emission and quantitative connections with observations. }

abstract="A variety of statistical methods for understanding variability in the time domain for low count rate X-ray and gamma-ray sources are explored. Variability can be detected using nonparametric (Anderson-Darling and overdispersion tests) and parametric (sequential likelihood-based tests) tools. Once detected, variability can be characterized by nonparametric (autocorrelation function, structure function, wavelet analysis) and parametric (multiple change point model such as Bayesian Blocks, integer autoregressive models, C-statistic and Poisson regression) methods. New multidimensional variability detection approaches are outlined. Software packages designed for high energy data analysis are deficient but tools are available in the R statistical software environment. Most of the methods presented here are not commonly used in high energy astronomy.",

abstract = {Summary
The central engines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are powered by accreting supermassive black holes, and while AGNs are known to play an important role in galaxy evolution, the key physical processes occur on scales that are too small to be resolved spatially (aside from a few exceptional cases). Reverberation mapping is a powerful technique that overcomes this limitation by using echoes of light to determine the geometry and kinematics of the central regions. Variable ionizing radiation from close to the black hole drives correlated variability in surrounding gas/dust but with a time delay due to the light travel time between the regions, allowing reverberation mapping to effectively replace spatial resolution with time resolution. Reverberation mapping is used to measure black hole masses and to probe the innermost X-ray emitting region, the UV/optical accretion disk, the broad emission line region, and the dusty torus. In this article, we provide an overview of the technique and its varied applications.}

    abstract = { The discovery of pulsars opened a new research field that allows studying a wide range of physics under extreme conditions. More than 3,000 pulsars are currently known, including especially more than 200 of them studied at gamma-ray frequencies. By putting recent insights into the pulsar magnetosphere in a historical context and by comparing them to key observational features at radio and high-energy frequencies, we show the following: ▪ Magnetospheric structure of young energetic pulsars is now understood. Limitations still exist for old nonrecycled and millisecond pulsars. ▪ The observed high-energy radiation is likely produced in the magnetospheric current sheet beyond the light cylinder. ▪ There are at least two different radio emission mechanisms. One operates in the inner magnetosphere, whereas the other one works near the light cylinder and is specific to pulsars with the high magnetic field strength in that region. ▪ Radio emission from the inner magnetosphere is intrinsically connected to the process of pair production, and its observed properties contain the imprint of both the geometry and propagation effects through the magnetospheric plasma. We discuss the limitations of our understanding and identify a range of observed phenomena and physical processes that still await explanation in thefuture. This includes connecting the magnetospheric processes to spin-down properties to explain braking and possible evolution of spin orientation, building a first-principles model of radio emission and quantitative connections with observations. }

abstract="A variety of statistical methods for understanding variability in the time domain for low count rate X-ray and gamma-ray sources are explored. Variability can be detected using nonparametric (Anderson-Darling and overdispersion tests) and parametric (sequential likelihood-based tests) tools. Once detected, variability can be characterized by nonparametric (autocorrelation function, structure function, wavelet analysis) and parametric (multiple change point model such as Bayesian Blocks, integer autoregressive models, C-statistic and Poisson regression) methods. New multidimensional variability detection approaches are outlined. Software packages designed for high energy data analysis are deficient but tools are available in the R statistical software environment. Most of the methods presented here are not commonly used in high energy astronomy.",

Device operation is explained throughout with the support of technology computer-aided design (TCAD) semiconductor simulations.Characterisation techniques of CMOS image sensors are discussed in detail, including the use of the photon transfer curve (PTC) for determining the many device parameters. Solved examples are included with the purpose of helping readers gain an understanding of the practical use of the formulas. The main audience includes physicists and engineers in image sensor characterisation and development.Key features• Includes many semiconductor device and circuit simulations as a tool to illustrate the operating principles.• Covers both the semiconductor physics and the most important electronic circuits comprising a CMOS image sensor.• Presents solved examples and a list of the most important ‘take-aways’ within each chapter.• Discusses some specialised topics, such as charge collection, sources of dark current, reflective barriers, backside illumination and potential gradients.• Provides detailed analysis of the noise sources and the readout techniques in CMOS image sensors.• Covers the on-chip readout circuits at transistor level and presents the essential off-chip electronics with practical examples.},
