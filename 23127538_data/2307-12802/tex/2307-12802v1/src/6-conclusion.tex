We propose an algorithm for optimization-based ILC of nonlinear systems using sequential quadratic programming framework.
We formulate the ideal optimization problem and find approximate solutions using models of the true plant.
We illustrate the performance of the algorithm on a precision motion control simulation study using a high-fidelity simulator. The results show that our method works well under various parameter tunings and we are able to show significant improvement in the tracking error over baseline initial iterations. 

Future work will consider a formal analysis to provide robust convergence guarantees on the proposed method, as well as experiments on physical systems to verify the simulation study results.
