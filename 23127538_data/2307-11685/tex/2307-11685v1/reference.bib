    abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been used recently in many areas achieving successful results. A multi-period supply chain operation can be viewed as a sequential decision-making problem for which Deep RL may be appropriate. Previous uses of such approach on related problems consider only serial or two-echelon supply chains with limited decision possibilities. In this research a four-echelon supply chain with two nodes per echelon and stochastic customer demands is considered. An MDP formulation and a Non-Linear Programming model of the problem are presented. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO2) is used in order to find a good policy to operate the entire supply chain and minimize total operating costs. An agent based on a linearized model is used as a baseline. Experimental results indicate that PPO2 is a suitable and competitive approach for the proposed problem.},

    abstract = {One of the challenging issues in supply chain management is the coordination of ordering processes, especially in dynamic situations. In recent years, reinforcement learning algorithms are considered to be efficient techniques for solving such problems. In this paper, an agent-based simulation technique has been integrated with a reinforcement learning algorithm and has been applied to model a four-echelon supply chain that faces non-stationary customer demands. This approach leads to the development of a novel and intelligent simulation-based optimization framework, which includes a detailed simulation modeling of supply chain behavior. Finally statistical methods, including the Var technique, are used for the risk evaluation and sensitivity analysis have been provided to support the decision making process under uncertainty.},
