  "abstract": "We describe a mechanism in which the graviton acquires a mass from the functional measure without violating the diffeomorphism symmetry nor including Stückelberg fields. Since gauge invariance is not violated, the number of degrees of freedom goes as in general relativity. For the same reason, Boulware-Deser ghosts and the vDVZ disconinuity do not show up. The graviton thus becomes massive at the quantum level while avoiding the usual issues of massive gravity.",
