  "abstract": "According to general relativity, the generic early-universe dynamics is chaotic. Various quantum-gravity effects have been suggested that may change this behavior in different ways. Here, it is shown how key mathematical properties of the classical dynamics can be extended to evolving quantum states using quasiclassical methods, making it possible to apply the established dynamical-systems approach to chaos even to quantum evolution. As a result, it is found that quantum fluctuations contribute to the reduction of the primordial chaos in early-universe models.",
