\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a pairwise dataset Papt for GUI conversion and retrieval between Android phones and tablets.
As far as we know, this is the first dataset aims to bridge phone and tablet GUIs.
We explain and analyze the data source of this dataset. 
We illustrate the two approaches for collecting pairwise GUIs and introduce our data collection tools.
We use an example to show the format of our GUI pairs and show the distribution of UI view types and GUI pair similarity in our dataset.
We also demonstrate how to access this dataset and compare the advantages of our dataset with current other GUI datasets.
% We perform preliminary experiments for two tasks: GUI conversion and GUI retrieval.
% We apply current widely used GUI generation and retrieval approaches in this dataset and analyze their performance.
% We show some examples of GUI pages generated by selected current approaches.
% We also discuss some valuable research problems based on current experimental results.
