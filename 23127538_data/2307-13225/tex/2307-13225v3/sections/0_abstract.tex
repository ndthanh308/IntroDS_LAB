With the popularity of smartphones and tablets, users have become accustomed to using different devices for different tasks, such as using their phones to play games and tablets to watch movies.
To conquer the market, one app is often available on both smartphones and tablets.
However, although one app has similar graphic user interfaces (GUIs) and functionalities on phone and tablet, current app developers typically start from scratch when developing a tablet-compatible version of their app, which drives up development costs and wastes existing design resources.
Researchers are attempting to employ deep learning in automated GUIs development to enhance developers' productivity.
Deep learning models rely heavily on high-quality datasets.
There are currently several publicly accessible GUI page datasets for phones, but none for pairwise GUIs between phones and tablets.
This poses a significant barrier to the employment of deep learning in automated GUI development.
In this paper, we collect and make public the Papt dataset, which is a pairwise dataset for GUI conversion and retrieval between Android phones and tablets.
