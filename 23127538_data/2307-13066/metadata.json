  "abstract": "Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is a wireless communication technology designed for short-range applications. It is characterized by its ability to generate and transmit radio-frequency energy over an extensive frequency range. This paper provides an overview of UWB technology including its definition, two representative schemes and some key characteristics distinguished from other types of communication. Besides, this paper also analyses some widely used applications of UWB technology and highlights some of the challenges associated with implementing UWB in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, this paper expands upon UWB technology to encompass terahertz technology, providing an overview of the current status of terahertz communication, and conducting an analysis of the advantages, challenges, and certain corresponding solutions pertaining to ultra-wideband THz communication.",
