  "abstract": "Quantum metrology is recognized for its capability to offer high-precision estimation by utilizing quantum resources, such as quantum entanglement. Here, we propose a generalized Tavis-Cummings model by introducing the $XY$ spin interaction to explore the impact of the many-body effect on estimation precision, quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). By deriving the effective description of our model, we establish a closed relationship between the QFI and the spin fluctuation induced by the $XY$ spin interaction. Based on this exact relation, we emphasize the indispensable role of the spin anisotropy in achieving the Heisenberg-scaling precision for estimating a weak magnetic field. Furthermore, we observe that the estimation precision can be enhanced by increasing the strength of the spin anisotropy. We also reveal a clear scaling transition of the QFI in the Tavis-Cummings model with the reduced Ising interaction. Our results contribute to the enrichment of metrology theory by considering many-body effects, and they also present an alternative approach to improving the estimation precision by harnessing the power provided by many-body quantum phases.",
