  "abstract": "Ramanujan in his notebook recorded two modular equations involving multiplier with moduli of degrees (1,7) and (1,23). In this paper, we find some new Ramanujan's modular equations involving multiplier with moduli of degrees (3,5) and (1,15), and give concise proofs by employing Ramanujan's multiplier function equation.",
