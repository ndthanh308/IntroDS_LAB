abstract = {In the last 3 years there has been a huge increase in the use of pore-scale modeling to study multiphase flow and transport in porous media. Starting from single pore models of fluid arrangements, computations of relative permeability, interfacial area, dissolution rate and many other physical properties have been made. Combined with a realistic description of the pore space, predictive modeling of a variety of processes, including waterflood relative permeability and mass transfer coefficients, is now possible. This review highlights some of the major advances, with an emphasis on models of wettability and three-phase flow.}

Pore networks with up to 10,000 pores are considered, with rules for the formation and movement of foam lamellae by the mechanisms of snap-off, leave-behind and lamella division enforced throughout. The study explores the roles of these mechanisms, and by implication, the appropriate form of the foam-generation function for mechanistic foam simulation. Results are compared with previous studies. In particular, they reconcile an apparent contradiction in the foam-generation model of Rossen and Gauglitz [W.R. Rossen, P.A. Gauglitz, Percolation theory of creation and mobilization of foam in porous media, AIChE J. 36 (1990) 1176], and identify how foam is created near the inlet of the porous medium when lamella division controls foam generation. In the process, we identify a new mechanism of snap-off and foam generation near the inlet of the medium.}

  abstract = {There have been several foam field applications in recent years. Foam treatments targeting gas mobility control in injectors as well as gas blocking in production wells have been performed without causing operational problems. The most widely used injection strategy of foam has been injecting alternating slugs of surfactant in brine with gas injection. This procedure seems to be beneficial as injection is easy to perform and control below fracturing pressure. Simultaneous injection of surfactant solution and gas may give difficulties, especially with interpretation of the tests, if fracturing pressure are exceeded during the injection period. This paper reviews critical aspects of foam for reservoir applications and intends to motivate for further field trials. Key parameters for qualification of foam are: foam generation, propagation in porous medium, foam strength and stability of foam. Stability is discussed, especially in the presence of oil at reservoir conditions. Data on each of these topics are included, as well as extracted summary of relevant literature. Experimental studies have shown that foam is generated at low surfactant concentration even below the CMC (critical micelle concentration). Results indicate that in situ foam generation in porous medium may depend on available nucleation sites. In situ generation of foam is complex and has been found to be especially difficult in oil wet carbonate rocks. Foam propagation in porous medium has been summarized, and propagation rate for a given experiment seems to be constant with time and distance. Laboratory studies confirm a propagation rate of 1-3 m/day. Field tests performed have not given reliable information of foam propagation rate, and future field pilots are encouraged to include observation wells in order to gain information of field-scale foam propagation. Foam strength is generally high with all gases. The exception is CO2 at high pressure where CO2 becomes supercritical. Stability of foam has been studied in laboratory and field tests, and has confirmed long-term stability of foam.},

  abstract = {{Foams are routinely used worldwide to divert acid in well-stimulation treatments, and to divert gas flow in improved oil recovery (IOR) projects on a pilot basis. The complexity of foam behavior and the apparent contradictions among foam studies have bedeviled attempts to understand foams and to design effective field treatments.In 1992, Osterloh and Jante1 identified two distinct foam-flow regimes: a high-quality (dry) regime, in which the steady-state pressure gradient is independent of the gas flow rate, and a low-quality (wet) regime, in which the pressure gradient is independent of the liquid flow rate. New data for strong foams in a variety of porous media, with various surfactant formulations, and over a range of flow rates, show this behavior to be general. In each regime, foam behavior is dominated by a single mechanism: at high qualities by capillary pressure and coalescence, and at low qualities by bubble trapping and mobilization. Based on these insights, a new, unified model unites foam behavior in acid-well stimulation and gasdiversion IOR and reconciles apparently contradictory data. This model correlates the effects of parameters, such as rock permeability and surfactant formulation, on foam behavior in the two flow regimes and on the transition between the two regimes. A variety of laboratory data supports the model's assumptions.The implications of these results for designing foam processes for IOR and acid diversion are discussed. These insights can guide the selection of foam formulation and injection quality for foam applications.}},

The theory accounts for pore shape, foam texture, contact-angle hysteresis, and bubble separation at pore throats, but not for the effects of gas compressibility or of the Plateau borders where liquid lamellae contact the pore wall. Quantitative estimates of (∇p)min depend on pore shape, foam texture, and surface tension. For medium-textured foams (bubbles 400 μm in diameter in bulk), reasonable parameter values give (∇p)min = 18–32 kPa/m (0.8–1.4 psi/ft) for CO2 foams and 125–240 kPa/m (5–11 psi/ft) for others foams. Lower gas/liquid surface tension causes the lower estimate for CO2 foams. For most foams, foam texture must coarsen substantially as foam flows away from the well in oilfield application, or formation plugging results. Further, to flow at 20–45 kPa/m (1–2 psi/ft), foam bubbles must be at least 1 or more cm, or hundreds of pores, in length. CO2 foams, on the other hand, can still flow if bubbles are somewhat smaller. The highest values of (∇p)min are predicted for foams in pores with high aspect ratio (body radius/throat radius), sharp corners, and narrow throats, and at low capillary pressures (wet foams).}

This mechanism is based on the classic study of Roof on the breakup of oil droplets passing through pore throats into water-filled pores. This paper calls into question whether this mechanism applies to foam generation at steady-state in homogeneous porous media.}

    abstract = { 1—The dynamical theory of the instability of a long cylindrical column of an incompressible perfect liquid under the action of capillary force has been given by Rayleigh, neglecting the effect of the surrounding fluid. According to his results, if the column becomes varicose with wave-length λ, the equilibrium of the column is unstable, provided λ exceed the circumference 2πa of the cylinder, in accordance with the result of Plateau’s statical theory; and the degree of instability, as indicated by the value of q in the exponential eqt to which the motion is assumed to be proportional, depends upon the value of λ reaching a maximum when λ = 4.51 × 2a. The case of a long cylindrical column of an incompressible viscous liquid has also been discussed by Rayleigh, again leaving out of consideration the effect of the surrounding fluid. Assuming the viscosity to be very great compared with the inertia and neglecting the effect of the latter, he has shown that for a very viscous liquid column the maximum instability occurs when the wave-length of the varicosity is very large in comparison with the radius of the cylinder, i. e., when λ = ∞ theoretically. Quite recently G. I. Taylor has made interesting experimental researches, together with some theoretical investigations, upon the mode of formation of the cylindrical thread by the disruptive effect of the viscous drag of one fluid on the other, by putting a small drop of a viscous liquid in definable shearing fields of flow of another viscous liquid. He has thus thrown much light upon the mechanism of the formation of emulsions. In the course of his experiments he observed an interesting phenomenon, in one case when the ratio of the viscosity of the liquid forming the thread to that of the surrounding liquid is 0.91, that after the apparatus which was used to produce the field of flow was stopped the final thread gradually broke up into a number of small drops spaced at nearly regular intervals, although it had seemed quite stable while the apparatus was in motion. In connection with this interesting phenomenon, Professor G. I. Taylor kindly suggested to the writer a problem of investigating the character of the equilibrium of a long cylindrical thread of a viscous liquid surrounded by an­other viscous fluid under the action of interfacial surface tension as well as under the effect of viscous forces acting on the liquid inside the column by the surrounding viscous fluid. The effect of the latter is expected to play some important role in the phenomenon under con­sideration, although, as mentioned already, its effect had been neglected by Rayleigh in his investigation. }

    abstract = { When a viscous fluid filling the voids in a porous medium is driven forwards by the pressure of another driving fluid, the interface between them is liable to be unstable if the driving fluid is the less viscous of the two. This condition occurs in oil fields. To describe the normal modes of small disturbances from a plane interface and their rate of growth, it is necessary to know, or to assume one knows, the conditions which must be satisfied at the interface. The simplest assumption, that the fluids remain completely separated along a definite interface, leads to formulae which are analogous to known expressions developed by scientists working in the oil industry, and also analogous to expressions representing the instability of accelerated interfaces between fluids of different densities. In the latter case the instability develops into round-ended fingers of less dense fluid penetrating into the more dense one. Experiments in which a viscous fluid confined between closely spaced parallel sheets of glass, a Hele-Shaw cell, is driven out by a less viscous one reveal a similar state. The motion in a Hele-Shaw cell is mathematically analogous to two-dimensional flow in a porous medium. Analysis which assumes continuity of pressure through the interface shows that a flow is possible in which equally spaced fingers advance steadily. The ratio λ = (width of finger)/(spacing of fingers) appears as the parameter in a singly infinite set of such motions, all of which appear equally possible. Experiments in which various fluids were forced into a narrow Hele-Shaw cell showed that single fingers can be produced, and that unless the flow is very slow λ = (width of finger)/(width of channel) is close to ½, so that behind the tips of the advancing fingers the widths of the two columns of fluid are equal. When λ = ½ the calculated form of the fingers is very close to that which is registered photographically in the Hele-Shaw cell, but at very slow speeds where the measured value of λ increased from ½ to the limit 1.0 as the speed decreased to zero, there were considerable differences. Assuming that these might be due to surface tension, experiments were made in which a fluid of small viscosity, air or water, displaced a much more viscous oil. It is to be expected in that case that λ would be a function of μU/T only, where μ is the viscosity, U the speed of advance and T the interfacial tension. This was verified using air as the less viscous fluid penetrating two oils of viscosities 0.30 and 4.5 poises. }

ABSTRACT={Immiscible two-phase flow of Newtonian fluids in porous media exhibits a power law relationship between flow rate and pressure drop when the pressure drop is such that the viscous forces compete with the capillary forces. When the pressure drop is large enough for the viscous forces to dominate, there is a crossover to a linear relation between flow rate and pressure drop. Different values for the exponent relating the flow rate and pressure drop in the regime where the two forces compete have been reported in different experimental and numerical studies. We investigate the power law and its exponent in immiscible steady-state two-phase flow for different pore size distributions. We measure the values of the exponent and the crossover pressure drop for different fluid saturations while changing the shape and the span of the distribution. We consider two approaches, analytical calculations using a capillary bundle model and numerical simulations using dynamic pore-network modeling. In case of the capillary bundle when the pores do not interact to each other, we find that the exponent is always equal to 3/2 irrespective of the distribution type. For the dynamical pore network model on the other hand, the exponent varies continuously within a range when changing the shape of the distribution whereas the width of the distribution controls the crossover point.}
