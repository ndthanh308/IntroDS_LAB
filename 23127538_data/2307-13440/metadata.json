  "abstract": "We construct novel scalarized black hole (BH) solutions beyond the general relativity (GR) framework. These scalarized BH solutions are extended from the Schwarzschild one and the non-Schwarzschild one in the pure Einstein-Weyl gravity. By studying the BH entropy and free energy, we demonstrate that the scalarized BH extending from the Schwarzschild one exhibits thermodynamically preferred. We obtain these novel solutions by directly solving the full fourth-order equations of motion. This narrows the problematic solution space obtained by commonly adopted second-order reduction to physically valid spaces. Our findings also unveil the evasion of the no-hair theorem within the realm of higher-derivative gravity.",
