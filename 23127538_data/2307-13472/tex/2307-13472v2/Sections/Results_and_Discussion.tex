%\subsection{Bands/Dos}

GPNL exhibits lower electric conductivity compared to
graphene due to its distinct physical properties, particularly
its formation energies and band gaps. The 
influence of pore size and quantity on these properties is 
depicted in Fig. 
\ref{fig:DOS}. Our DFTB calculations reveal that GPNL 
possesses a bandgap of approximately 0.96 eV from 
the DOS calculations, while graphene lacks a bandgap altogether.
The porosity of GPNL has the potential to significantly modify its 
electronic characteristics and catalytic performance by increasing
its surface area, in good agreement with reported 
results by G. Brunetto et al \cite{brunetto2012nonzero}. The 
electronic band structures, illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:DOS},
reveal that the valence and conductance
bands for carbon atoms are located at the $\Gamma$ point.
%while the bottom 
%of the conduction bands is found at the $K$--point.
The band gap of GPNL is structure--dependent and can range from
zero to a few electron volts. Theoretical studies have predicted
band gaps for GPNL ranging from 0 eV to approximately 3.3 eV,
depending on the specific structure and calculation 
method employed \cite{balandin2011thermal,brunetto2012nonzero}.
It should be noted that the semi--local functionals tend to 
underestimate the band gaps of GPNL structures. 
It is also noticed the selected path show the characteristic
gaps at the M and $\Gamma$ point reported by DFT 
calculations \cite{C2TC00006G} and our results reported in the SM. 
The slight discrepancy in negative energies can be attributed to 
variations in the SK parameters applied in our calculations and the 
pseudo potentials used in our DFT calculations. Nevertheless, this 
fair agreement still provides validation for our results.



To validate our findings, density functional theory (DFT) 
calculations were conducted using the PBE exchange--correlation 
functional. The calculations were carried out under periodic 
boundary conditions, and the Brillouin zone integration was 
performed with the $\Gamma$ point considered. Kohn--Sham orbitals 
were employed as plane waves up to an energy cutoff of 90 Ry to 
ensure convergence in the structural properties of the systems. 
The Quantum-ESPRESSO ab--initio package with relativistic-
corrected pseudo-potentials was utilized for computing the 
density of states, system energies, and band structures.
%The 
%exchange-correlation energy was evaluated using the generalized 
%approximation (GGA).
The total electronic density of states (DOS) for GPNL
reveals significant overlaps between the C--2s and C--2p curves, 
indicating the presence of strong sp$^3$ hybridized covalent
bonding states.

GPNL consists of interconnected benzene 
rings arranged in a hexagonal lattice, similar to graphene.
The slight discrepancy in negative energies for the GPNL sheet
can be attributed to variations in the SK parameters applied in our 
calculations and the pseudo potentials used in our DFT calculations. 
Nevertheless, this fair agreement still provides validation for our 
results.
This supports the application of SCC--DFTB in studying gas
separation processes, which is crucial for the production
and utilization of clean fuels. 
Different paths for the GPNL sheet was considered 
and shown in the supplementary material (SM) of this work.

%\subsection{Binding Energy }

Figure \ref{fig:PECs} illustrates the binding energies as a
function of separation distance for graphene (a) and GPNL (b), considering different adsorbate sites as
labeled in the inset figure. We performed adsorption 
calculations for isolated H$_2$, CH$_4$, and CO$_2$ molecules
on both systems.
To ensure accurate calculations, we included a 50 \AA{}
vacuum section above the sample to minimize boundary effects.
Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the $x$--$y$
directions to simulate a semi-infinite surface. 
For the $k$--point sampling, we employed a $4\times4\times1$
Monkhorst--Pack set throughout all calculations.

Fig. \ref{fig:PECs} present results for the physisorption 
pathways for H$_2$, CH$_4$, and CO$_2$ molecules on both
graphene and GPNL sheets. In the case of graphene, we 
observe that the bond length for molecular hydrogen and 
methane molecules is approximately 2.2 \AA{}, with binding 
energies of -0.052 eV (in good agreement with Lee et al. \cite{10.1063/5.0116092}) and -0.165 eV, respectively. 
Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide molecule exhibits a bond 
length of 2.6 \AA{} and a binding energy of -0.151 eV.
For GPNL, we find that H$_2$ and CH$_4$ molecules have bond 
lengths of 2.25 \AA{}, with binding energies of -0.043 eV 
and -0.132 eV, respectively. CO$_2$ on GPNL has a bond 
length of 2.62 \AA{}, accompanied by a binding energy of 
-0.125 eV. 
In the SM, we present the physisorption pathways of all 
the adsorbate site of both carbon sheets, showing that 
adsorbate sites associated with
the hexagonal and square holes exhibit a lower likelihood for 
molecule adsorption; specially methane molecules are more 
likely to bond to the top of the carbon atoms, with a binding
energy of -0.2 $\pm$ 0.05 eV showing excellent conditions
for gas separation for this energy barrier 
\cite{C2TC00006G,D0RA04286B}. 


These results serve as the basis for configuring
the initial conditions in our 
MD simulations. We ensure an initial distance greater
than 8 \AA{} to prevent interactions between the 
molecules and the carbon sheet at the outset of the
simulation.
These findings offer valuable insights into the interactions 
between carbon sheets and these molecules, which are essential 
for understanding the physical processes in our MD simulations.
It is worth noting that dispersion 
corrections
play a significant role in these calculations, particularly due
to the hybridization of the system and the presence of CH$_4$
molecules.
Similar trends are observed for graphene, where the adsorbate site
located at the top of the carbon atoms is more favorable for both 
physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms confirming reported 
results for hydrogen trapping by graphene 
\cite{10.1063/1.1329889}, 
indicating a higher likelihood of attracting molecules.



%\subsection{CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ adsorption mechanisms}
\subsection{Dynamical adsorbtion of CH$_4$ and CO$_4$ molecules}


After conducting MD simulations at room temperature 
and an impact energy of 8 eV, the emission of hundreds of H$_2$, 
CO$_2$, 
and CH$_4$ molecules is analyzed by calculating the 
probabilities of adsorption, reflection, and transmission, which are 
defined as:
\begin{equation}
    P = 100 \times \frac{N_{x}}{N_{\rm Tot}},
\end{equation}
where $N_{\rm Tot}$ is the total number of MD simulations, while 
$N_x$ is the number of cases for adsorption, reflection, and 
transmission calculated by using the following conditions based 
on the last frame of the MD simulations: 
1) Adsorbed cases: Molecules with a final position between
a sphere centered at the material with a 
radius of 3.5 \AA{} and the direction of the velocity vector
points towards the surface is considered as adsorbed; 
2) Reflection cases: Molecules 
with a final position larger than 3.5 \AA{} and a velocity vector
oriented in the opposite direction
to the surface normal is counted as reflected; 3) 
Transmission cases: Molecules with a final position below the
surface and a distance larger than -3.5 \AA{} are counted as
transmitted. 
The counts for these cases are tabulated in Table \ref{tab:prob}.

     simulations, including transmission, reflection, and adsorption,

     gas separation compared to graphene.}

\end{table}



For graphene, we did not observe dissociation of H$_2$ and CO$_2$ 
molecules among the reflected molecules. 
The molecule initiates its trajectory with a 
kinetic energy (KE) of 8eV. However, it undergoes a gradual 
deceleration as it comes into contact with the charge
cloud of the carbon sheets. Upon colliding with a carbon
sheet at various adsorbate sites, the molecule is reflected, 
promoting its vibrational and rotational movements.
To observe dissociation mechanism, a
higher impact energy than 10 eV would be required.
However, it is worth noting that 
such high--energy collisions could result in the creation of 
vacancies in the graphene sheet by displacing a carbon atom, 
which is not observed in our MD simulations at 
8 eV. On the other hand, some 
of the reflected CH$_4$ molecules underwent dissociation, 
and a few of them were able to attach to the graphene sheet.
In order to bond more 
CH$_2$ molecules to graphene, a lower impact energy would be 
sufficient.
In the case of GPNL, its inherent porosity allowed for a higher 
number of transmitted cases for both H$_2$ and CO$_2$ molecules. We 
observed that some carbon dioxide molecules dissociated into CO+O, 
with 
the CO molecules bonding to the GPNL sheet. This highlights the 
advantage of GPNL's porous structure in facilitating gas 
transmission and reactivity compared to graphene.

From our MD simulation results, we have observed that CH$_4$ molecules 
can undergo reflection and dissociation, leading to the formation of 
CH$_2$ and H$_2$ as the main process. Figure \ref{fig:dynamics} 
displays a histogram of the counts of the final positions 
of the C and H atoms for the final frames of the simulations for 
graphene (a) and GPNL 
(b), providing a visual representation of the observed dynamics. 
This plot is used to count for the number of events 
with a probability of transmission, reflection, or absorption.
In the figures, we correlated the visualization 
all the events to the histogram by shown the last frame of all the 
MD simulations in a single image where 
C atoms forming graphene and GPNL are represented as 
gray spheres, adsorbed CH$_2$ molecules are depicted as black 
spheres 
for C atoms and white spheres for hydrogen atoms, while reflected 
molecules are represented by turquoise spheres for molecular 
hydrogen 
and purple spheres for C atoms. 
Within our observations, we find that CH$_2$ 
molecules are more likely to binding to the carbon sheets. In 
alternative scenarios, both CH$_2$ and H$_2$ molecules are seen
to dissociate after collision with the carbon sheets. A notable 
observation is the differential behavior of hydrogen molecules in 
graphene compared to GPNL. 

The GPNL's porous structure facilitates 
the transmission of hydrogen molecules, making it a promising 
candidate for applications such as hydrogen production in the 
context of energy generation. While graphene sheets present 
high scattering of H$_2$ molecules.
We have found that CH$_4$ molecules are unable to transmit through 
graphene, whereas in the case of GPNL, there is a probability of 
approximately 50\% for transmission, accompanied by dissociation 
and the 
production of molecular hydrogen. This behavior can be attributed 
to the 
porous nature of the materials and the impact energy of the 
emitted. 
In addition, we analyze the velocity 
distributions 
of carbon (C), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H) atoms at the last
frame considering all the MD simulations for each case. 
Notably, molecular hydrogen exhibits the highest velocities, 
while CH$_2$ molecules exhibit the lowest 
velocities after being reflected by the carbon sheets. 
This observation provides an initial indication of the bonding 
behavior of the ejected molecules, which is discussed in more
detail within the SM.


Furthermore, we have noted that CH$_2$ molecules can form bonds 
with GPNL by infiltrating the porous structure and binding to the 
underlying C atoms. This property distinguishes GPNL from 
graphene, as the latter typically requires the presence of
defects to enable molecule transmission. 
Here, the distinctive arrangement of 
sp$^2$--carbon atoms in GPNL creates a two--dimensional 
lattice with regularly spaced sized pores which is notably
larger than the kinetic diameters of H$_2$, CO$_2$, and CH$_4$, 
facilitating the favorable diffusion of these molecules. 
This mechanism highlights the potential of GPNL is a 
promising material for gas separation, particularly 
for CH$_4$, as supported by our MD simulations for CO$_2$ 
purification as well. 



Figure \ref{fig:reflected} presents the analysis of reflected 
molecules from the surfaces of graphene and GPNL at an 
impact energy of 8 eV. 
The analysis involves determining the internuclear distance
between atoms in the final frame of the simulations.
In the case of H$_2$ molecules (Figure \ref{fig:reflected}a), we 
observe a uniform distribution of the internuclear distance
around the bond length of 0.74 Å. 
This distribution arises 
from the excitation of vibrational and rotational states 
due to the exchange of kinetic energy during a collision
with the surfaces, as previously discussed.
For CO$_2$ molecules, we observe the splitting of the molecules
into CO and O, with a majority exhibiting a homogeneous distribution 
around 
1.43 Å for the internuclear distance which corresponds to the CO 
bond length. Oxygen atoms are identified with 
an internuclear distance larger than 2.5 Å.
Finally, CH$_4$ molecules undergo splitting into CH$_2$ and H$_2$ 
molecules with the highest probabilities, with CH$_3$+H dissociation 
with a low probability. 
Molecular hydrogen is characterized by an internuclear 
distance of around 0.74 Å and a higher degree of excitation in 
vibrational states. 
We identify CH$_2$ (methylene) molecules as the main dissociation
channel with a peak in the histogram at $~1.8$\AA{} being the 
internuclear distance between H atoms.
The porosity of GPNL makes it a more promising 
candidate for H$_2$ production compared to graphene, 
as demonstrated by MD simulations.
The histogram illustrates the distribution of reflected 
molecules with different bond lengths corresponding to 
their excited vibrational states. For instance, when 
H$_2$ molecules are emitted onto the 2D materials, 
they tend to vibrate towards states close to their 
ground state. On the other hand, H$_2$ molecules originating
from the dissociated methane exhibit various bond lengths
due to their excited vibrational and rotational states. 
This concept also applies to CO$_x$ and CH$_x$ molecules.

\subsection{Optical Absorption Spectra, electron transport and sensitivity}
\label{subsec:sensitivity}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Before performing the optical absorption 
calculations, We conducted unconstrained optimizations of the
carbon sheet 
in the presence of various molecules and atoms, each in different 
scenarios. In instances where a physisorption pathway was relevant, 
constrained optimization calculations were performed to establish 
the optimal bond lengths. This approach was adopted to simplify the 
computational process, allowing for a more efficient and accurate 
determination of the atomic configurations.

The optical spectra are calculated
for different cases of molecular adsorption: 
1) For hydrogen molecules, we considered a single H$_2$ 
molecule positioned above a carbon atom, as well as two hydrogen 
atoms positioned above two different carbon atoms, where the 
interaction between them is minimal; the obtained results 
are in a good agreement with experimental and ab--initio data where 
the absorption intensities of the interband transitions occurring
in the Dirac band (mid-IR and visible) 
\cite{LEE2016109,Keith,ZHANG2018137}.
2) For CO$_2$ and its split CO+O molecule, we positioned the CO$_2$ 
molecule above a carbon atom, and for the resulting CO+O system, 
we placed it above two different carbon atoms. 
The effect of carbon dioxide on the graphene sheet is similar
to that observed for the H$_2$ molecule. For GPNL, 
the influence decreases compared to the pristine case. 
However, the split of CO+O enhances the absorbance of the graphene sheet 
at the same wavelength as the CO$_2$ molecule. For the GPNL case, 
the absorbance rate is lower than that observed in the carbon
dioxide case. 
3) For methane molecules, we investigated several 
configurations: CH$_4$, CH$_2$+H$_2$ (molecular hydrogen and 
methylene as a main dissociation channel), CH$_2$+H+H, and CH$_2$,
as they are crucial for sensor development 
\cite{GUI2020113959, zhu2016theoretical}. 


Figure \ref{fig:optical} presents the normalized optical absorption
spectrum of graphene (a) and GPNL (b) obtained using
the Liouville--von Neumann equation for the hydrogen molecule, 
methane, and carbon dioxide and the rest of the results are 
displayed in the SM. These findings reveal that pristine 
graphene doesn't interact with visible light, as expected
\cite{Hashemi_2013}. 
However, when it's paired with a hydrogen molecule or carbon 
dioxide, graphene becomes more effective at absorbing visible
light. 
In contrast, the addition of a methane molecule primarily
enhances its ultraviolet absorption capabilities. 
Furthermore, when it comes to the GPNL, the presence of attached 
molecules doesn't exert any discernible effect on the optical 
properties of the carbon sheet. The structural characteristics of 
the pores do not significantly enhance light absorption, and its 
band gap doesn't cause excessive scattering of visible light. This 
underscores the material's stability in maintaining its optical 
properties across diverse conditions. 
In the SM, we noticed that among all the configurations, 
the optical absorbance is
maximized in the 300--450 wavelength range for the 
CH$_2$+H+H case, attributed to the bonding between H 
atoms and the C atom of graphene. In contrast, in the 
case of GPNL, CH$_2$ increases the optical 
absorbance in the range of 400 to 550 wavelengths due to the 
system's hybridization and modifying 
the DOS.

% Describe figures


Advancements in 2D materials have expanded the scope of potential 
applications, particularly in energy harvesting and storage, due 
to their high electron transport efficiency and extensive surface 
area with numerous active sites \cite{KUMAR2023232256}. In our 
study, we adopted a computational approach based on a $\pi$-
orbital tight-binding Hamiltonian to simulate the electrical 
transport phenomena of graphene and GPNL. We employed the 
SCC-DFTB method along with Non--equilibrium Green's functions 
\cite{Pecchia_2008}.
In the tight--binding representation, the interaction between 
atoms is limited to a finite range. 
We can solve the contact self--energy function, also known 
as the surface Green's function, for 
the matrix block corresponding to the atoms near the extended 
device region using a recursive algorithm \cite{D0CP04188B}. 
This allows us to 
accurately describe the electrical transport properties of the 
materials and analyze their behavior under various conditions.

Figure \ref{fig:transmissionProb} illustrates our findings 
for graphene in a) and GPNL in b)
that are in good agreement with reported results for 
pristine graphene in the literature and by Villegas 
et al. \cite{D0CP04188B} for the pristine GPNL; 
by adding different molecules it is revealed the preferential 
adsorption of extrinsic chemical 
species like CH$_4$, CO$_2$, and H$_2$ at interdomain sites, 
leading to a significant enhancement of scattering effects in 
both graphene and GPNL. To delve into this intriguing 
behavior, we employed the non--pulsating direct current (NPDC) 
waveform, known for its ability to maintain the stability of 
adsorbates even under ultrahigh--vacuum conditions. Unlike PDC 
waves, which exhibit continuous voltage fluctuations, NPDC waves 
maintain a constant voltage, ensuring the stability of the 
adsorbed species within the scope of our computational approach. 
For graphene, it is noteworthy that the 
adsorption of individual hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane 
molecules leads to a reduction in the transmission probability. 
This reduction has a direct impact on the density of states
within the altered system. Additionally, it is observed that 
the effects on the 
DOS of the armchair--wise graphene sheet is associated 
with the bond formed between carbon atoms and these molecules; 
which are reflected in the transmission probability of two symmetric 
minima around the Fermi.
On the other hand, when considering the GPNL sheet, the presence of 
singly bonded molecules to carbon atoms does not appear to induce 
substantial modifications in the transmission probability. 
However, there is a decrease in the transmission probability 
within the energy range of approximately ±1.5 to 1.0 eV. This
observation highlights the potential of GPNL as a promising 
candidate for the development of gas sensors, emphasizing its 
sensitivity to changes in its surrounding gaseous environment.
Since, the strong mechanical properties play a key role in 
maintaining the structural integrity of porous frameworks, 
preventing their shrinkage or collapse. Therefore, the 
presence of channels and pores facilitates rapid electrolyte 
diffusion, leading to an augmentation in electrical conductivity 
as shown by our results.

%Smith et al. \cite{smi} predicted that the band gap of 1.22 eV, similar to that of silicon, would render GPNL as a possible replacement in silicon electronic devices; for example, GPNL is a better candidate than graphene for use in field effect transistors. Froudakis investigated the possibility of using hydrogenation to tailor the electronic properties of GPNL.

Fig \ref{fig:I-U} shows the difference 
of the current for each molecule $X$ as a function of
the voltage as:
\begin{equation}
    S = 100 \% \frac{\big| I_{X}-I_g \big|}{I_{X}},
\end{equation}
with $I_{X}$ of each molecule and the surface and 
$I_g$ the current of the graphene in a) 
and GPNL in b). Noticing that the adsorption of CH$_x$ compounds 
increases the sensitivity of the surfaces.
The tunneling currents for the sheets as a function of 
the voltage for various adsorbed molecules are shown in 
the inset plots by I–-U characteristics graphs for 
voltages below 300 mV.
Our results are in a qualititive good agrement with reported 
experimental data \cite{SHABAN20194510} showing 
a decrease of 25 mV for GPNL and an efficiency increas of 
4\% for methane single molecules. 
Thus, the porous structure of GPNL offers distinct 
advantages, including increased surface area, reduced density, 
and improved accessibility to guest objects. 
This structure is highly suitable for applications involving 
light absorption and electron/ion transport. 
Specifically, it shortens the migration path of charge carriers
from the point of generation to the active surface, 
thereby facilitating electron migration to the surface.
Therefore, we suggest that GPNL based materials can be 
better candidates than graphene ones for use in field effect 
transistors, as Zener diodes, and faster sensors.
