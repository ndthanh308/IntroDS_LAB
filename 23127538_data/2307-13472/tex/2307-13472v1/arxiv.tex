\begin{abstract}

Graphenylene (GPNL) is a two--dimensional
carbon allotrope with a hexagonal lattice structure containing 
periodic pores. The unique arrangement of GPNL offers potential 
applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy storage, and 
gas separation. Specifically, its advantageous 
electronic and optical properties, make it a promising candidate for 
hydrogen production and advanced electronic devices. 
In this study, we employ 
a computational chemistry--based modeling approach to investigate
the adsorption mechanisms of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on monolayer
GPNL, with a specific focus on their effects on optical
adsorption and electrical transport properties at room
temperature.
To simulate the adsorption dynamics as closely as possible to 
experimental conditions, we utilize the self--consistent charge 
tight--binding density functional theory (SCC--DFTB). 
Through semi--classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
we observe the formation of H$_2$ molecules from the
dissociation of CH$_4$ and the formation of CO+O species 
from carbon dioxide molecules. 
This provides insights into the adsorption and dispersion
mechanisms of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on GPNL.
Furthermore, we explore the impact of molecular 
adsorption on optical absorption properties. 
Our results demonstrate that CH$_4$ and CH$_2$ affects drastically
the optical adsorption of GPNL, while CO$_2$ does not significantly 
affect the optical properties of the two--dimensional material. 
To analyze 
electron transport, we employ the open--boundary non--equilibrium 
Green's function method. By studying the conductivity of GPNL and 
graphene under voltage bias up to 300 mV, 
we gain valuable insights into the electrical transport 
properties of GPNL under optical absorption conditions.
The findings from our computational modeling approach
might contribute to 
a deeper understanding of the potential applications of GPNL in 
hydrogen production and advanced electronic devices.
