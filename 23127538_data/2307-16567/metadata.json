  "abstract": "This paper presents a novel model for bivariate stochastic fluid processes that incorporate a ruin-dependent behavioral switch. Unlike typical models that assume a shared underlying process, our model allows each process to operate independently until a ruin event in one triggers a change in the other. We develop a mathematical framework for our model, exploring its properties and providing closed-form expressions for approximations of key performance metrics, particularly the joint law of the ruin times. Our approach introduces a class of compatible pathwise approximations to analyze ruin probabilities, which we subsequently study through a matrix-analytic framework.",
