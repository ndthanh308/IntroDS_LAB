  "abstract": "We investigate how the macroscopic response and the size scaling of the ultimate strength of materials change when their local strength is sampled from a fat-tailed distribution and the degree of disorder is varied in a broad range. Using equal and localized load sharing in a fiber bundle model, we demonstrate that a transition occurs from a perfectly brittle to a quasi-brittle behaviour as the amount of disorder is gradually increased. When the load sharing is localized the high load concentration around failed regions make the system more prone to failure so that a higher degree of disorder is required for stabilization. Increasing the system size at a fixed degree of disorder an astonishing size effect is obtained: at small sizes the ultimate strength of the system increases with its size, the usual decreasing behaviour sets on only beyond a characteristic system size. The increasing regime of the size effect prevails even for localized load sharing, however, above the characteristic system size the load concentration results in a substantial strength reduction compared to equal load sharing. We show that an adequate explanation of the results can be obtained based on the extreme order statistics of fibers' strength.",
