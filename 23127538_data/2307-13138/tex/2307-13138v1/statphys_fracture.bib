  abstract={While the number of asteroids with known shapes has drastically increased over 
  the past few years, little is known on the time-evolution of shapes and the underlying physical processes. 
  Here we propose an averaged abrasion model based on micro-collisions, accounting for asteroids 
  not necessarily evolving toward regular spheroids, rather (depending on the fall-back rate of ejecta) 
  following an alternative path, thus confirming photometry-derived features, e.g., existence of large, 
  relatively flat areas separated by edges. We show that our model is realistic, since the bulk of the 
  collisions falls into this category.}

The effect of hydrogen embrittlement on the stress-strain curves measured at various strain rates is simulated by assuming that the hydrogen is generated in localised corrosion pits and subsequently diffuses into the bulk, thereby reducing the strain-to-failure of individual fibres. The stress-strain curves obtained from these simulations show the same strain rate effect as was experimentally observed.},

Results clearly demonstrate that the spacing between obstacles to dislocation motion controls fracture toughness.

During the collision of two rough particles, energy is dissipated and, possibly, linear momentum is transferred to rotational momentum. We examine the model system by varying the parameters as, for example the coefficient of friction μ. Using an event driven algorithm, we focus on the fluidized regime, i.e., on the case of rather small densities. We find that the behavior of the system depends on the frictional properties of both particles and walls. Introducing the particle-particle friction changes the behavior quantitatively. Rough, dissipative walls lead to a qualitative change of the system’s behavior in the case of low densities. We present an expression for the ratio of kinetic and rotational energy in terms of the particle’s moment of inertia, of the coefficient of friction, and of the tangential restitution. 
Furthermore, we compare our simulations with recent experiments on vibrated granular systems in {2D.}},

We here develop an elastic model for the flagellum based on Kirchhoff's theory of an elastic rod that describes such a polymorphic transformation and use resistive force theory to couple the flagellum to the aqueous environment. We present Brownian dynamics simulations that quantitatively reproduce the force-extension curves and study how the ratio {\${\textbackslash}Gamma\$} of torsional to bending rigidity and the extensional rate influence the response of the flagellum. An upper bound for {\${\textbackslash}Gamma\$} is given. Using clamped flagella, we show in an adiabatic approximation that the mean extension, where a local coiled-to-normal

	abstract = {One of the effective parameters of the behavior of rockfill materials is particle breakage. As a result of particle breakage, both the stress-strain and deformability of materials change significantly. In this article, a novel approach for the two-dimensional numerical simulation of the phenomenon in rockfill (sharp-edge particles) has been developed using combined {DEM} and {FEM.} All particles are simulated by the discrete element method {(DEM)} as an assembly and after each step of {DEM} analysis, each particle is separately modeled by {FEM} to determine its possible breakage. If the particle fulfilled the proposed breakage criteria, the breakage path is assumed to be a straight line and is determined by a full finite element stress-strain analysis within that particle and two new particles are generated, replacing the original particle. These procedures are carried out on all particles in each time step of the {DEM} analysis. Novel approach for the numeric of breakage appears to produce 
reassuring physically consistent results that improve earlier made unnecessary simplistic assumptions about breakage. To evaluate the effect of particle breakage on rockfill's behavior, two test series with and without breakable particles have been simulated under a biaxial test with different confining pressures. Results indicate that particle breakage reduces the internal friction but increases the deformability of rockfill. Review of the v-p variation of the simulated samples shows that the specific volume has initially been reduced with the increase of mean pressures and then followed by an increase. Also, the increase of stress level reduces the growing length of the v-p path and it means that the dilation is reduced. Generally, any increase of confining stress decreases the internal friction angle of the assembly and the sample fail at higher values of axial stresses and promotes an increase in the deformability. The comparison between the simulations and the reported experimental data shows that the 
numerical simulation and experimental results are qualitatively in agreement. Overall the presented results show that the proposed model is capable with more accuracy to simulate the particle breakage in rockfill.},

We derive a scaling relation τa=2τ−1 between the local cluster exponent τa and the global avalanche exponent τ. For length scales longer than a crossover length proportional to the Larkin length, the aspect ratio of the local clusters scales with the roughness exponent of the line model. Our analysis provides an explanation for experimental results on planar crack avalanches in Plexiglas plates, but the results are applicable also to other systems with long-range interactions.},

A major drawback is that an equation based on the continuum theory is unable to predict the various complicated microscopic effects, even though those effects have a strong influence on the macroscopic behaviour, e.g. on fracture, fatigue and life time. A large number of attempts has been made to correct the shortcomings of the continuum-based theories. One interesting alternative to common approaches for the numerical modelling of discontinuous materials is the Discrete Element Method {(DEM).} Within the {DEM}, the individual particles are modelled as stiff (or rigid) bodies which interact via contact forces. This simplification has the advantage of the complicated microscopic behaviour being represented by a simple system of linear equations based on a relatively small number of {parameters.{\
textless}br/{\textgreater}This} paper describes the requirement for new computational methods for the modelling of fracture mechanics. First of all a proof of the described method will be shown. Then two examples are presented in order to verify the Discrete Element Method. Furthermore it will be shown how the corresponding material parameters are gained and implemented and how the boundary conditions have to be modelled in order to achieve exact results for the stress and strain fields of {2D} shells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Preceded by a smooth transition, the crumpled ball that characterizes the high-pressure state contains less than 50\% air and exhibits separate ordered domains. All data for different sheet thicknesses, sizes, and numbers were found to collapse to a master line when using volume ratio and pressure as the plotting parameters, which suggests the existence of a scaling relation. Based on these findings, we deduced a bundled-layer model that could consistently explain six outstanding properties at both low and high pressures. This successful union of theory and experiment has strong bearings on other soft-matter systems where similar changes in mechanical response are also linked to reorganization of structure.},

Also the Voronoi construction is a tool of proved utility for the virtual representation of powders and grains. In this paper a technique that combines the two methods and provides a framework for the study of the three-dimensional mechanical behavior of granular matter is proposed. In order to understand the capabilities of the new method, a number of computer simulations of the cubic (true) triaxial test, measuring the mechanical behavior of packing of particles, is carried out. Results from tests with packing of complex-shaped particles represented by {“Voronoi} particles” are compared with corresponding results of packing of spherical particles. Features such as the saturation value for the macroscopically observed coefficient of friction, as reported in the literature, are compared for the packing of spheres and for the packing of {
“Voronoi} particles,” showing that the difference in shape strongly affects the results. The proposed technique and simulation results can be used to help understand how the individual shape of grains affects the macroscopic mechanical behavior of granular matter such as cohesionless soils.},

The variations of the average crack velocity with the external driving force are measured for a brittle rock and shown to display two distinct regimes: an exponential law characteristic of subcritical propagation at a low driving force and a power law above a critical threshold. This behavior can be explained quantitatively by extending linear elastic fracture mechanics to disordered systems. In this description, the motion of a crack is analogous to the one of an elastic line driven in a random medium, and critical failure occurs when the external force is sufficiently large to depin the crack front from the heterogeneities of the material.},

Under vertical compression the deformation of a thin-walled box differs from that of, e.g., a cylindrical shell. It is demonstrated here that compression of a box can be described by a set of generic scaling laws representing three successive regimes: a linear, wrinkled, and collapsed regime. The linear Hookean regime represents the normal behavior before any instability sets in, while the following wrinkled regime is shown to be analogous to compression of thin-film blisters. The compression force reaches its maximum at the onset of the final collapsed regime that has all the characteristics of membrane crumpling. The theoretical scaling laws were confirmed by numerical simulations.},

We investigate the existence of universal scaling properties by analyzing a Californian catalog and by means of numerical simulations of an epidemic-type model. We show that the interevent time distribution exhibits a universal behavior over the entire temporal range if four characteristic times are taken into account. The above analysis allows us to identify the scaling form leading to universal behavior and explains the observed deviations. Furthermore, it provides a tool to identify the dependence on the mainshock magnitude of the c parameter that fixes the onset of the power law decay in the Omori law.},

Indeed, while clustering in time and space is widely accepted, much more questionable is the existence of magnitude correlations. The standard approach generally assumes that magnitudes are independent and therefore in principle unpredictable. Here we show the existence of clustering in magnitude: earthquakes occur with higher probability close in time, space, and magnitude to previous events. More precisely, the next earthquake tends to have a magnitude similar but smaller than the previous one. A dynamical scaling relation between magnitude, time, and space distances reproduces the complex pattern of magnitude, spatial, and temporal correlations observed in experimental seismic catalogs.},

As small-scale (i.e. sub-element) damage is described as well as cracks extending above the element scale, an approach referred
to as “meso-damage” is developed. The latter, which is based on the knowledge of random distributions of initiation sites,
predicts different regimes such as single or multiple fragmentation. The experimental opening crack pattern obtained in edge-on-impact
test is reproduced numerically.},

Below a critical stress, the dislocations are jammed within their glide plane due to long-range elastic interactions and the material exhibits plastic response, while above this critical stress the dislocations are mobile (the unjammed phase) and the material flows. We use dislocation dynamics and scaling arguments in two dimensions to show that the critical stress grows with the square root of the dislocation density. Consequently, dislocations jam at any density, in contrast with granular materials, which only jam below a critical density.},

The observations are explained by a simple model where the behavior of a liquid droplet on a surface is characterized by the surface tension for a free droplet and the surface tension at the interface with the silicon surface. A method is suggested for the determination of the ratio of these parameters. Within the framework of this model cluster fragmentation into several smaller droplets is caused by thermal fluctuations due to droplet oscillations. The model could prove useful for controlling the size of nano-particles on a surface.},

	abstract = {In Civil Engineering materials subjected to stress or strain states a quantitative evaluation of damage is of great importance due to the critical character of this phenomenon, which at a certain point suddenly turns into a catastrophic failure. An effective damage assessment criterion is represented by the statistical analysis of the amplitude distribution of acoustic emission {(AE)} signals emerging from the growing microcracks. The amplitudes of such signals are distributed according to the {Gutenberg-Richter} {(GR)} law and characterised through the b-value which decreases systematically with damage growth. On the other hand, the damage process is also characterised by the progressive coalescence of microcracks to form fracture surfaces. Geometrically the fractal dimension D of the damaged domain is expected to decrease from an initial value comprised between 2 and 3 towards a final value nearly equal to 2. The b-value and the fractal analysis, are here applied to two case studies of 
concrete specimens loaded up to failure, and the obtained results are compared and discussed. In particular, we emphasize that a single fractal dimension does not adequately describe a crack network, since two damaged domains with the same fractal dimension could have significantly different properties.},

The mesoplasticity and damage mechanisms occurring under high cycle fatigue are illustrated by means of observations conducted on a mild steel submitted to purely reversed torsion and push-pull fatigue tests. Plastic glide systems and microcracks are distributed in a very heterogeneous way at the surface of the observed smooth specimens. The microstructure and more specifically the configuration of the grain where the crack initiates and its immediate vicinity (neighbour grains and microstructural barriers) control most of the fatigue {life.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}To} account for this heterogeneous feature, a distribution of the elastic shakedown threshold is assumed and probability calculations carried out in the framework of the weakest 
link concept lead to a new fatigue criterion. In particular, a spatial and a directional heterogeneity factor are introduced. The former represents the way the stress is distributed within a component, while the latter is a measure of the number of highly stressed glide systems. It is then proved that the crack initiation modelling according to mesoplasticity consideration is not enough to reflect the macroscopic fatigue behaviour when changing the loading mode. The directional heterogeneity factor is indeed unable to explain alone the different fatigue limits under purely reversed tension and torsion. A normal stress effect clearly acts and can be readily introduced through a dependence of the scale factor in the initiation {distribution.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}A} key feature of this probabilistic mesoscopic approach is its directional formulation.

	abstract = {Two analytical mechanics-based models of dynamic fragmentation in brittle materials are proposed and solved to predict fragment size and time to fragmentation onset in terms of fundamental material properties and the applied strain rate. Previous widely adopted analytical models of dynamic fragmentation are based on relatively simple energy balance arguments, and assume that the fragmentation event occurs instantaneously. The present models account for the actual time-varying dynamic deformation that occurs prior to fragmentation onset. One of the models treats the fragmenting material as initially flaw-free, and determines the minimum fragment size predicted by a dynamic instability analysis. The second model accounts for initial flaw spacing (which may correlate physically with, for example, grain size), and a dynamic instability analysis is employed to determine which flaws become critical. The fragment size predictions of the present models and two previous energy-based models are found to 
agree at extremely high strain rates ([approximate]5×107/s for dense alumina), but the present, more realistic analysis indicates that the regime of validity of the energy-based models is rather restricted. The predictions of the present models are also shown to agree with those of a recent numerical finite element simulation of dynamic fragmentation which applies to a lower strain rate regime. Comparisons of the two new models show that if a material contains initial flaws whose spacing is smaller than the predicted fragment size of an equivalent "unflawed" material, the fragment size of the preflawed material will be smaller in general, but usually not as small as the initial flaw spacing. The analysis also permits determination of the evolution of the strain rate distribution in a prospective fragment before and after fragmentation initiation; results are presented for some example cases. Finally, closed-form analytical results are derived for minimum fragment size and time to fragmentation for strain 
rates in the quasi-static regime; these show the fragment size to be independent of strain rate in this regime, and the time to fragmentation initiation to be inversely proportional to the strain rate.},

The mosaic patterns obtained by sheet reconstruction from fragments of two parts (painted in two different colors) of the ball cut in half also possess a fractal scale invariance characterized by the box fractal dimension {DBF=1.68±0.04}, which is independent on the sheet size.

Here we study a model for frictional sliding with long-range interactions and recurrent damage that is parameterized by a process of damage and partial healing during sliding. We introduce a failure threshold weakening parameter into the cellular automaton slider-block model which allows blocks to fail at a reduced failure threshold for all subsequent failures during an event. We show that a critical point is reached beyond which the probability of a system-wide event scales with this weakening parameter. We provide a mapping to the percolation transition, and show that the values of the scaling exponents approach the values for mean-field percolation (spinodal nucleation) as lattice size L is increased for fixed R. We also examine the effect of the weakening parameter on the frequency-magnitude scaling 
relationship and the ergodic behavior of the model.},

The system is shown to undergo a critical transition which is analyzed by looking at the topological structure of the force network. At the critical packing fraction there is a sudden growth of the number of polygons in the network. Above the critical packing fraction the number of triangles keeps growing while the number of the rest of polygons is weakly reduced. Then, we prove that in the jammed regime, there is a linear relationship between the number of triangles and the coordination number. Furthermore, the presence of these minimal structures is revealed to be connected with the evolution of some important topological properties, suggesting its importance to understand the physical properties of the packing and the onset of rigidity during the compression.},

Moreover, the reloaded region becomes a narrower and narrower `cone', so that the damage in this cone becomes closer and closer to the so-called global load sharing rule used, for instance, to study a fiber bundle.

For modeling fracture, molecular-dynamics simulations were run on the resulting samples. The results of our simulations reproduce the main experimental features. In addition to achieving a steady-state crack under a constant driving displacement (which has not yet been achieved by other atomistic models for amorphous materials), the runs show microbranching, which increases with driving, transitioning to macrobranching for the largest drivings. In addition to the qualitative visual similarity of the simulated cracks to experiment, the simulation also succeeds in reproducing qualitatively the experimentally observed oscillations of the crack velocity.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4991},
	abstract = {The {"Self-organized} criticality" {(SOC)}, introduced in 1987 by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld, was an attempt to explain the 1/f noise, but it rapidly evolved towards a more ambitious scope: explaining scale invariant avalanches. In two decades, phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, granular piles, snow avalanches, solar flares, superconducting vortices, sub-critical fracture, evolution, and even stock market crashes have been reported to evolve through scale invariant avalanches. The theory, based on the key axiom that a critical state is an attractor of the dynamics, presented an exponent close to -1 (in two dimensions) for the power-law distribution of avalanche sizes. However, the majority of real phenomena classified as {SOC} present smaller exponents, i.e., larger absolute values of negative exponents, a situation that has provoked a lot of confusion in the field of scale invariant avalanches. The main goal of this chapter is to shed light on this issue. The essential role of the exponent 
value of the power-law distribution of avalanche sizes is discussed. The exponent value controls the ratio of small and large events, the energy balance --required for stationary systems-- and the critical properties of the dynamics. A condition of criticality is introduced. As the exponent value decreases, there is a decrease of the critical properties, and consequently the system becomes, in principle, predictable. Prediction of scale invariant avalanches in both experiments and simulations are presented. Other sources of confusion as the use of logarithmic scales, and the avalanche dynamics in well established critical systems, are also revised; as well as the influence of dissipation and disorder in the "self-organization" of scale invariant dynamics.},

In this article we present, to our knowledge, the first molecular dynamics simulations of {DEP} of nanometer-sized colloidal particles. We introduce a simplified model for a polarizable nanoparticle, consisting of a large charged macroion and oppositely charged microions, in an explicit solvent. The model is then used to study {DEP} motion of the particle at different combinations of temperature and electric field strength. In accord with linear response theory, the particle drift velocities are shown to be proportional to the {DEP} force. Analysis of the colloid {DEP} mobility shows a clear time dependence, demonstrating the variation of friction under non-equilibrium. The time dependence of the mobility further results in an apparent weak variation of the {DEP}
 displacements with temperature.},

Analysis of the different scaling parameters obtained for experimental and numerical data leads us to formulate the hypothesis that the type of scaling function obtained depends on the level of correlation among fracture events in the system.},

The exponent controlling the asymptotic decay and the fractal dimensionality of epicenters clearly indicate triggering by static stress. The nonmonotonic behavior of the linear density and its dependence on the main shock magnitude can be interpreted in terms of diffusion of static stress. This is supported by the power law growth with exponent H≃0.5 of the average main-aftershock distance. Implementing static stress diffusion within a stochastic model for aftershock occurrence, we are able to reproduce aftershock linear density spatial decay, its dependence on the main shock magnitude, and its evolution in time.},

The crack dynamics is studied as a function of the length of the initial notch. The cracks show accelerated straight motion until branching appears. We show that branching can be triggered by two different mechanisms: namely, the kinematics of the strain field and back-reflected surface waves traveling on the crack lip. We also propose a qualitative explanation for the kinematic branching mechanism in terms of the effects of the lattice discretization on Yoffe’s stress field. The kinematic branching mechanism is understood by analyzing the disconnection times of the nodes ahead and aside of the crack tip.},

	abstract = {Damage evolution and time-to-failure are investigated for a model material in which damage formation is a stochastic event. Specifically, the probability of failure at any site at time t is proportional to σi(t)η, where σi(t) is the local stress at site i at time t and differs from the applied stress because of the stress redistribution from prior damage. An analytic model of the damage process predicts two regimes of failure: percolationlike failure for η⩽2 and 'avalanche' failure for η{\textgreater}2. In the percolationlike regime, failure occurs by gradual global accumulation of damage culminating in a connected cluster which spans the system. In the avalanche regime, failure occurs by rapid growth of a single crack after a transient period during which the critical crack developed. The scalings of the transient period, the subsequent crack dynamics, and the time-dependent probability distribution for failure are determined analytically as functions of the system size and the exponent η. 
Specific predictions are that failure is more abrupt with increasing η, failure times scale inversely with a power of the logarithm of system size, and the distribution of failure times is a double exponential and broadens with increasing η, so that the failure becomes less predictable as it is becoming more abrupt. The conditions for the transition to the rapid growth regime are identified, offering the possibility of early detection of impending failure. In a companion paper, numerical simulations of this failure process in two-dimensional lattices are compared in detail to the analytical predictions.},

The simulation was executed on the {B-A} scale-free network, {E-R} random network, Internet {AS} level network, and the power grid of the western United States. The results show that the model is feasible and effective. By studying the relationship between network cost and robustness, we find that the model can defend against cascading failures better and requires a lower investment cost when higher robustness is required.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with addressing how biological cells react to mechanical impulse. We propose a particle based model to numerically study the mechanical response of these cells with subcellular detail. The model focuses on a plant cell in which two important features are present: (1) the cell’s interior liquidlike phase inducing hydrodynamic phenomena, and (2) the cell wall, a viscoelastic solid membrane that encloses the protoplast. In this particle modeling framework, the cell fluid is modeled by a standard smoothed particle hydrodynamics {(SPH)} technique. For the viscoelastic solid phase (cell wall), a discrete element method {(DEM)} is proposed. The cell wall hydraulic conductivity (permeability) is built in through a constitutive relation in the {SPH} formulation. Simulations show that the {SPH-DEM} model is in reasonable agreement with compression experiments on an in vitro cell and with analytical models for the basic dynamical modes of a spherical liquid filled shell. We have 
performed simulations to explore more complex situations such as relaxation and impact, thereby considering two cell types: a stiff plant type and a soft animal-like type. Their particular behavior (force transmission) as a function of protoplasm and cell wall viscosity is discussed. We also show that the mechanics during and after cell failure can be modeled adequately. This methodology has large flexibility and opens possibilities to quantify problems dealing with the response of biological cells to mechanical impulses, e.g., impact, and the prediction of damage on a (sub)cellular scale.},

This appears to be an instance of a single random walk model leading to all three forms of behavior by simply changing parameter values. Furthermore, the model offers the great advantage of analytical tractability. Our model is {non-Markovian} in that the next jump of the walker is (probabilistically) determined by the history of past jumps. It also has elements of intermittency in that one possibility at each step is that the walker does not move at all. This rich encompassing scenario arising from a single model provides useful insights into the source of different types of asymptotic behavior.},

The latter leads to variations in the frequency-magnitude distribution if the distribution is constrained to those earthquakes that are close in space and time to the directly following event.},

discrete grain structure of the concrete was generated assuming the grains to be spherical. The load versus {CMOD} plots thus
simulated agreed reasonably well with the experimental results. Moreover, acoustic emission {(AE)} hits were recorded during
the test and compared with the number of fractured lattice elements. It was found that the cumulative {AE} hits correlated well
with the cumulative fractured lattice elements at all load levels thus providing a useful means for predicting when the micro-cracks
form during the fracturing process, both in the pre-peak and in the post-peak regimes.},

In this paper, a two-dimensional polydisperse sample with high-void ratio is constructed and then sheared in a simple shear numerical device at different confinement levels. We study the macroscopic response of the material in terms of mean and deviatoric stresses and strains. We show that the introduction of a local force scale, i.e., the tensile strength of the cemented bonds, causes the material to behave in a rigid-plastic fashion, so that a yield surface can be easily determined. This yield surface has a concave-down shape in the mean:deviatoric stress plane and it approaches a straight line, i.e., a Coulomb strength envelope, in the limit of a very dense granular material. Beyond yielding, the cemented structure gradually degrades until the material eventually behaves as a cohesionless granular material. Strain localization is also investigated, 
showing that the strains concentrate in a shear band whose thickness increases with the confining stress. The void ratio inside the shear band at the steady state is shown to be a material property that depends only on contact parameters.},

While undergoing plastic deformation the material shows considerable optical changes. The regions where plastic flow is occurring show 'tension lines', probably equivalent to similar lines in bone. These are probably caused by voids forming in the protein matrix. The work of fracture is very different in different loading directions, being about 1.65 \${\textbackslash}times \$ 10\${\textasciicircum}{3}\$ J m\${\textasciicircum}{-2}\$ when fractured across the 
grain, and 1.5 \${\textbackslash}times \$ 10\${\textasciicircum}{2}\$ J m\${\textasciicircum}{-2}\$ when fractured along it. Nacre shows considerable ability to stop cracks. An attempt is made to explain qualitatively the mechanical behaviour of nacre in terms of its submicroscopic structure. It is concluded that the precise geometric arrangement of the plates is most important, and that this constraint may make nacre less suitable for shells that must be built quickly.},

The latter conduct this activity through in-house research and by collecting information originating in other firms' spillovers. Thus, research and development activity owes both to independent searching and to interaction diffusing information. We study the conditions under which this idiosyncratic effort yields effects that have either local, system-wise negligible impacts or cumulate to generate significant aggregate ones. In the latter case, global effects feed back upon the incentive to innovate and therefore on the strength of local interaction as well as on autonomous research efforts. It is these dynamic forces that we model. We compare cases in which significant aggregate effects do emerge with cases in which they do not and study their outcome on innovation-directed investment and on long-term growth.},

The understanding of the origin of such bursty patterns is hind ered by the lack of tools to compare different systems using a common framework. Here we propose to characterize the bursty nature of real signals using orthogonal measures quantifying two distinct mechanisms leading to burstiness: the interevent time distribution and the memory. We find that while the burstiness of natural phenomena is rooted in both the interevent time distribution and memory, for human dynamics memory is weak, and the bursty character is due to the changes in the interevent time distribution. Finally, we show that current models lack in their ability to reproduce the activity pattern observed in real systems, opening up avenues for future work.},

Yet the microscopic mechanisms ruling the crossover from static to dynamic friction are still the object of active research. Here, we analyze the onset of slip of a xenon {(Xe)} monolayer sliding on a copper {(Cu)} substrate. We consider thermal-activated creep under a small external lateral force, and observe that slip proceeds by the nucleation and growth of domains in the commensurate interface between the film and the substrate. We measure the activation energy for the nucleation process considering its dependence on the external force, the substrate corrugation, and particle interactions in the film. To understand the results, we use the classical theory of nucleation and compute analytically the activation energy which turns out to be in excellent agreement with numerical results. We discuss the relevance of our results to understand 
experiments on the sliding of adsorbed monolayers.},

For length scales longer than a crossover length proportional to the Larkin length, the aspect ratio of the local clusters scales with the roughness exponent of the line model.

Sample generation is an important, but time-consuming, step that precedes a calculation performed with the discrete element method {(DEM).} At present, there does not exist any software dedicated to {DEM} which would be similar to the mesh software that exists for finite element methods {(FEM).} A practical objective of the method is to build very large sphere packings (several hundreds of thousands) in a few minutes instead of several days as the current dynamic methods do. The developed algorithm uses a new geometric procedure to position very efficiently the polydisperse spheres in a tetrahedral mesh. The algorithm, implemented into {YADE-OPEN} {DEM} (open-source software), consists in filling tetrahedral meshes with spheres. In addition to the features of the tetrahedral mesh, the input parameters are the minimum and maximum radii (or their size ratio), and the magnitude of authorized overlaps. 
The filling procedure is stopped when a target solid fraction or number of spheres is reached. Based on this method, an efficient tool can be designed for {DEMs} used by researchers and engineers. The generated packings can be isotropic and the number of contacts per sphere is very high due to its geometric procedure. In this paper, different properties of the generated packings are characterized and examples from real industrial problems are presented to show how this method can be used. The current C++ version of this packing algorithm is part of {YADE-OPEN} {DEM} [20] available on the web (https://yade-dem.org).},

Here we describe and analyze a recent one-billion-atom simulation of ductile materials failure {[PNAS} 99 (9) (2002) 5783] where the complexity of creation and collective behavior of thousands of dislocations are revealed, for the first time, from atomic to submicron length scales. The amount of information that can be extracted from such large-scale simulations is truly overwhelming, and graphic visualization of dynamic dislocation motion and interactions are breathtaking. We present some of our preliminary analysis of the one-billion-atom simulation which indicates several interesting and unique features characterizing interactions among a large number of dislocations. A sessile defect structure is observed to develop on the time scale of several picoseconds, effectively locking further dislocation motion and causing the material to work harden. We make 
analysis of the activated slip systems, the dislocation reactions leading to rigid junctions and the formation of sessile defect structure. In order to render the present study more comprehensive to the readers from a continuum plasticity background and stimulate further interests in this area of research, we also include some brief reviews of some of the previous studies as well as commonly used simulation, visualization and analysis techniques on atomistic modeling of dislocation plasticity. Finally, we discuss possible ways to link continuum mechanics theories of plasticity with atomistic simulation results via the dislocation density tensor.},

The mechanical response is correlated with its microstructure and damage mechanisms. The mechanical response is found to vary significantly from specimen to specimen and requires the application of Weibull statistics in order to be quantitatively evaluated. The conch exhibited orientation dependence of strength as well as significant strain-rate sensitivity; the failure strength at loading rates between 10×103 and 25×103 {GPa} s-1 was approximately 50\% higher than the quasi-static strength. Quasi-static compressive failure occurred gradually, in a mode sometimes described as [`]graceful failure'. Crack deflection, delocalization of damage, and viscoplastic deformation of the organic layers are the most important mechanisms contributing to the unique mechanical properties of these shells.},

Such patterns are not well characterized by purely topological estimators: also patterns that both look different and result from different morphogenetic processes can have similar topology. A local geometric cue—the angles formed by the different branches at junctions—can complement topological information and allow the quantification of the large scale spatial coherence of the pattern. For patterns that grow over time, such as fracture lines on the surface of ceramics, the rank assigned by our method to each individual segment of the pattern approximates the order of appearance of that segment. We apply the method to various networklike patterns and find a continuous but sharp dichotomy between two classes of spatial networks: hierarchical and homogeneous. The former class results from a sequential growth process 
and presents large scale organization, and the latter presents local, but not global, organization.},

Using computer simulations we study the behavior of two-dimensional systems of colloids with such an interaction, focusing on how area fraction and repulsion range at fixed repulsion gradient may be used to tune the resulting kinetics and nonequilibrium structure. While the short-range attraction leads to aggregation, the long-range repulsion encourages growth of chains of particles due to repulsive intercluster interactions. Depending on area fraction/repulsion range we observe chain labyrinths, chain-compact aggregate coexistence, and connected networks of chains. The kinetics of cluster growth displays a sequence of connected networks and disconnected cluster or chain systems with increasing repulsion range, indicating the competing roles of connectivity of growing chains and repulsion-driven 
breakup of chains into compact aggregates. Chain-dominated systems show approximately logarithmic coarsening at late time that we interpret as the result of chains performing random walks in the randomly fluctuating potential landscape created by their neighbors, a situation reminiscent of glassy systems.},

We introduce a simple numerical algorithm to describe collision-induced fragmentation. We consider fragmentation induced by
collisions between pairs of particles and perform numerical studies for several classes of interaction kernels, and for several
types of breaking processes. We validate the algorithm by comparing the results of the kinetic evolution and particle size
statistics with previous analytical results for symmetric and asymmetric kernels. The excellent agreement obtained proves
the algorithm versatility. The method also allows us to examine generic kernels, for which no exact solutions are known.},

The regularity and symmetry of the fracture patterns have long fascinated naturalists. In view of the recent selection of two candidate nuclear waste sites in areas where polygonally fractured volcanic rocks are located, a better understanding of the fracture patterns is required. Field data indicate that the tetragonal networks at flow surfaces evolve systematically to hexagonal networks as the joints grow inward during solidification of lava. This evolution occurs by the gradual change of most orthogonal intersections to nonorthogonal intersections of about 120 degrees. The surface features and intersection geometries of columnar joints show that joint segments at any given level form sequentially yet harmoniously.},

	Developed after observations in desiccation experiments, the model describes the nucleation and propagation of cracks in a layer in contact with a frictional substrate. Competition between stress concentration at crack tips and pinning effect by friction leads to a cellular pattern. We characterized the events prior to cracking by a growth of correlation in the stress field, 
	and those during cracking by progressive damages manifested in the number of broken 
	bonds and energy releases. Qualitatively distinct regimes were shown to correspond to different stages of development. 
	A host of scaling behaviors in measurable quantities were derived and verified. 
	In particular, consistent with experiments, fragment area was found to be quadratic 
in the layer thickness and be smaller with increasing friction, which explains why morphologically 
similar patterns may occur over a diverse length scales.},

An advanced Voronoi algorithm is applied to generate polycrystal material structures based on arbitrary distribution functions of grain size.

A conducting fuse is heated locally by a Joule heating term. Heat diffuses to neighboring fuses by a diffusion term. When the temperature reaches a given threshold, the fuse breaks and turns into an insulator. The time dynamics is governed by the time scales related to the two terms, in the presence of quenched disorder in the conductances of the fuses. For the two limiting domains, when one time scale is much smaller than the other, we find that the global breakdown time tr follows {tr∼I2} and {tr∼L2}, where I is the applied current and L is the system size. However, such power law does not apply in the intermediate domain where the competition between the two terms produces a subtle behavior.},

In order to clarify the origin and the nature of the asperity-like phenomena, we investigate here the properties of the {OFC} model with emphasis on its stress distribution. It is found that the asperity formation is accompanied by self-organization of the highly concentrated stress state. Such stress organization naturally provides the mechanism underlying our observation that a series of asperity events repeat with a common epicenter site and with a common period solely determined by the transmission parameter of the model. 
Asperity events tend to cluster both in time and in space.},

	abstract = {We study reversible polymerization of rings. In this stochastic process, two monomers bond and, as a consequence, two disjoint rings may merge into a compound ring or a single ring may split into two fragment rings. This aggregation-fragmentation process exhibits a percolation transition with a finite-ring phase in which all rings have microscopic length and a giant-ring phase where macroscopic rings account for a finite fraction of the entire mass. Interestingly, while the total mass of the giant rings is a deterministic quantity, their total number and their sizes are stochastic quantities. The size distribution of the macroscopic rings is universal, although the span of this distribution increases with time. Moreover, the average number of giant rings scales logarithmically with system size. We introduce a card-shuffling algorithm for efficient simulation of the ring formation process and we present numerical verification of the theoretical predictions.},

Soc. 71, 668 (1958) and references therein]. At higher velocities, a crossover to inertial dynamics is observed. In each regime, when k is increased, the system bifurcates from periodic stick-slip to steady sliding: in the creep regime, the bifucation is a direct Hopf one; in the inertial regime it becomes subcritical. We identify, from comparison of the time dependence of the static friction coefficient 
μs(t) and of the velocity dependence of the stationary dynamic one, {μd(V)}, a memory length of the order of 1 μm. The V dependence of {μd(V)} changes from V weakening to V strengthening at the creep-inertial crossover. We propose a heuristic model of low-velocity friction based on two main ingredients: (i) following and extending the ideas of Ruina {[J.} Geophys. Res. 88, 10 359 (1983)], we define a phenomenological contact age accounting for the renewal of physical contacts on the scale of the memory length, and (ii) we assume that the dynamics is controlled by the Brownian motion of an effective creeping volume in a pinning potential, the strength of which increases with age.},

Within an effectively infinite medium, a crack’s dynamics perfectly correspond to inertialess behavior predicted by linear elastic fracture mechanics. Once a crack interacts with waves that it generated at earlier times, this description breaks down. Cracks then acquire inertia and sluggishly accelerate. Crack inertia increases with crack speed v and diverges as v approaches its limiting value. We show that these dynamics are in excellent accord with an equation of motion derived in the limit of an infinite strip {[M.} Marder, Phys. Rev. Lett. 66, 2484 (1991)].},

Two different types of system are considered: we analyze the three-point bending of a bar shaped specimen where the boundary and loading conditions ensure that crackling occurs during the propagation of a single crack; then we study a bundle of fibers where noise emerges as a consequence of spatially uncorrelated stick-slip rearrangements. We show that bursts characterizing the jerky propagation of a crack have a power law size distribution with an exponent which does not depend on the amount of disorder. Our calculations revealed that varying the amount of disorder in a stick-slip system, a phase-transition occurs: at high disorder stick-slip rearrangements occur in small bursts, while at low disorder macroscopic avalanches snap the system. Our investigations demonstrate that the relevance of disorder on crackling noise is strongly influenced by the presence or absence of stress 
concentrations in the system.},

	abstract = {The existence of juxtaposed regions of distinct cultures in spite of the fact that people’s beliefs have a tendency to become more similar to each other’s as the individuals interact repeatedly is a puzzling phenomenon in the social sciences. Here we study an extreme version of the frequency-dependent bias model of social influence in which an individual adopts the opinion shared by the majority of the members of its extended neighborhood, which includes the individual itself. This is a variant of the majority-vote model in which the individual retains its opinion in case there is a tie among the neighbors’ opinions. We assume that the individuals are fixed in the sites of a square lattice of linear size L and that they interact with their nearest neighbors only. Within a mean-field framework, we derive the equations of motion for the density of individuals adopting a particular opinion in the single-site and pair approximations. Although the single-site approximation predicts a single opinion 
domain that takes over the entire lattice, the pair approximation yields a qualitatively correct picture with the coexistence of different opinion domains and a strong dependence on the initial conditions. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations indicate the existence of a rich distribution of opinion domains or clusters, the number of which grows with L2 whereas the size of the largest cluster grows with ln L2. The analysis of the sizes of the opinion domains shows that they obey a power-law distribution for not too large sizes but that they are exponentially distributed in the limit of very large clusters. In addition, similarly to other well-known social influence {model—Axelrod’s} model—we found that these opinion domains are unstable to the effect of a thermal-like noise.},

Increments in excitatory interneuronal coupling in animals expose the system’s dependence on this parameter and its dynamical transmutability: moderate increases lead to power-law behavior of seizure energy and interevent times, while marked ones to scale-free (power-law) coextensive with characteristic scales and events. The coextensivity of power law and characteristic size regimes is predicted by models of coupled heterogeneous threshold oscillators of relaxation and underscores the role of coupling strength in shaping the dynamics of these systems.},

We find that, for materials with diverse mechanical properties, the shape of this fragment has an aspect ratio of 2∶1, with the length scale set by the initial crack offset s and the time scale set by the ratio of s to the pulling velocity. The cracks have a universal square root shape, which we understand by using a simple geometric model of the crack-crack interaction.},

	abstract = {I study a recently proposed statistical model of earthquake dynamics that incorporates aging as a fundamental ingredient. The model is known to generate earthquake sequences that quantitatively reproduce the spatial and temporal clustering of events observed in actual seismic patterns. The aim of the present work is to investigate if this model can give support to the empirical evidence that earthquakes can be triggered by transient small perturbations, particularly by the passing of seismic waves originated in events occurring in far geographical locations. The effect of seismic waves is incorporated into the model by assuming that they produce instantaneous small modifications in the dynamical state of the system at the time they are applied. This change in the dynamical state has two main effects. On one side, it induces earthquakes that occur right at the application of the perturbation. These are called immediate events. On the other side, after the application of the perturbation there is 
a delayed effect: the seismic activity increases abruptly after the perturbation, then falls down below the level of background activity, and eventually recovers to the background value. The time scale of these variations depends on the internal dynamics of the system, and is totally independent of the duration of the perturbation. The number of delayed events in excess of the background activity is typically observed to be around a factor of twenty larger than the number of immediate events. The origin of the enhanced activity period following the perturbation is associated to the existence of aging relaxation, and it does not occur if relaxation is absent. These findings give support to the experimental evidence that earthquake can be remotely triggered by small transient perturbations as those produced by seismic waves.},

	abstract = {The failure probability of engineering structures such as aircraft, bridges, dams, nuclear structures, and ships, as well as microelectronic components and medical implants, must be kept extremely low, typically {\textless}10−6. The safety factors needed to ensure it have so far been assessed empirically. For perfectly ductile and perfectly brittle structures, the empirical approach is sufficient because the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of random material strength is known and fixed. However, such an approach is insufficient for structures consisting of quasibrittle materials, which are brittle materials with inhomogeneities that are not negligible compared with the structure size. The reason is that the strength cdf of quasibrittle structure varies from Gaussian to Weibullian as the structure size increases. In this article, a recently proposed theory for the strength cdf of quasibrittle structure is refined by deriving it from fracture mechanics of nanocracks propagating by small, 
activation-energy-controlled, random jumps through the atomic lattice. This refinement also provides a plausible physical justification of the power law for subcritical creep crack growth, hitherto considered empirical. The theory is further extended to predict the cdf of structural lifetime at constant load, which is shown to be size- and geometry-dependent. The size effects on structure strength and lifetime are shown to be related and the latter to be much stronger. The theory fits previously unexplained deviations of experimental strength and lifetime histograms from the Weibull distribution. Finally, a boundary layer method for numerical calculation of the cdf of structural strength and lifetime is outlined.

	abstract = {The transition of a counter-chemotactic particle flow from a free-flow state to a jammed state in a quasi-one-dimensional path is investigated. One of the characteristic features of such a flow is that the constituent particles spontaneously form a cluster that blocks the path, called a path-blocking cluster {(PBC)}, and causes a jammed state when the particle density is greater than a threshold value. Near the threshold value, the {PBC} occasionally collapses on itself to recover the free flow. In other words, the time evolution of the size of the {PBC} governs the flux of a counter-chemotactic flow. In this Rapid Communication, on the basis of numerical results of a stochastic cellular automata {(SCA)} model, we introduce a Langevin equation model for the size evolution of the {PBC} that reproduces the qualitative characteristics of the {SCA} model.

In this paper, the application of a mesh-free method, called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics {(SPH)}, is demonstrated for simulating rock caving in a stratified deposit. The advantages for simulating caving processes using a mesh-free numerical framework are highlighted. Two different examples are chosen, one with elastic-brittle material behaviour with large yield strength (failure by brittle fracture) and the other with elasto-plastic material behaviour with relatively lower yield strength to allow ductile deformation of the rock mass. The modelling results capture the mechanistic aspects observed in caving processes. It is shown that the large-scale deformation and the associated fracture processes in caving can be effectively simulated using {SPH.} In the authors' knowledge, this work 
is the first attempt in demonstrating the application of a mesh-free method for simulating caving processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The mosaic patterns obtained by sheet reconstruction from fragments of two parts (painted in two different colors) of the ball cut in half also possess a fractal scale invariance characterized by the box fractal dimension {DBF=1.68±0.04}, which is independent on the sheet size. Furthermore, we noted that {DBF}, at least numerically, coincide with the universal fractal dimension of the intersection of hand folded paper ball with a plane.

The major achievements of the modified model are the prediction of a nonmonotonic behavior in both the average time to failure and the average fractal dimension of the electrical trees, and the prediction of a transition from branched to runaway trees as the applied voltage is increased.},

	abstract = {Tensile strength of rock is among the most important parameters influencing rock deformability, rock crushing and blasting results. To calculate the tensile strength from the indirect tensile {(Brazilian)} test, one must know the principal tensile stress, in particular at the rock disc center, where a crack initiates. This stress can be assessed by an analytical solution. A study of this solution for anisotropic (transversely isotropic) rock is presented.
The solution is given explicitly. The key expansion coefficients are obtained from a complex-valued 2×2 matrix equation. The convergence of the solution is greatly improved by a new procedure. It is shown that the dimensionless stress field depends only on two intrinsic parameters, {E'/E} and b. The stress at the center of the disc is given in charts as a function of these parameters (and the angle [theta]b between the direction of applied force and the plane of transverse isotropy). Furthermore, a new, reasonably accurate, approximate formula for the principal tension at the disc center, (0,0), is derived from the analytical solution:where The elastic parameters of rock in two perpendicular directions were measured in the laboratory. The result of the stress analysis was applied in calculating the indirect tensile strength of gneiss, which has a well-defined foliation plane (transversely isotropic). When the results were compared with the tensile strength of rock obtained by using a conventional formula 
that assumes isotropic material, there was a significant difference. Moreover, good agreement was observed for the tensile strength calculated from the stress charts and the proposed formula, when compared with other published stress charts.},

The particle-scale stiffnesses are derived from the given macroscopic elastic constants (i.e. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio). Firstly a bonded lattice model is presented. This model permits six kinds of relative motion and corresponding forces between each bonded particle pair. By comparing the strain energy distributions between the discrete lattices and the continuum, the explicit relationship between the microscopic and macroscopic elastic parameters can be obtained for the {2-D} hexagonal lattice and the {3-D} hexagonal close-packed and face-centered cubic structures. The results suggest that the normal stiffness is determined by Young's modulus and the particle size (in {3-D)}, and that the ratio of the shear to normal stiffness is related to Poisson's ratio. Rotational stiffness depends on the normal stiffness, shear stiffness and particle sizes. 
Numerical tests are carried out to validate the analytical results. The results in this paper have theoretical implications for the calibration of the spring stiffnesses in the Discrete Element Method.},

	abstract = {Biological materials such as spider silk display hierarchical structures, from nano to macro, effectively linking nanoscale constituents to larger-scale functional material properties. Here, we develop a model that is capable of determining the strength and toughness of elastic-plastic composites from the properties, percentages, and arrangement of its constituents, and of estimating the corresponding dissipated energy during damage progression, in crack-opening control. Specifically, we adopt a fiber bundle model approach with a hierarchical multiscale self-similar procedure which enables to span various orders of magnitude in size and to explicitly take into account the hierarchical topology of natural materials. Hierarchical architectures and self-consistent energy dissipation mechanisms (including plasticity), both omitted in common fiber bundle models, are fully considered in our model. By considering one of the toughest known materials today as an example application, a synthetic fiber 
composed of single-walled carbon nanotubes and polyvinyl alcohol gel, we compute strength and specific energy absorption values that are consistent with those experimentally observed. Our calculations are capable of predicting these values solely based on the properties of the constituent materials and knowledge of the structural multiscale topology. Due to the crack-opening control nature of the simulations, it is also possible to derive a critical minimal percentage of plastic component needed to avoid catastrophic behavior of the material. These results suggest that the model is capable of helping in the design of new supertough materials.},

The universality and the range of scales over which this regime extends are still debated. The topography of these surfaces is however often investigated with a finite contact probe. In this case, we show that the correlation function of the roughness can only be measured down to a length scale Δxc which depends on the probe size R, the Hurst exponent ζ of the surface and its topothesy l, and exhibits spurious behavior at smaller scales. First, we derive the dependence of Δxc on these parameters from a simple scaling argument. Then, we verify this dependence numerically. Finally, we establish the relevance of this analysis from {AFM} measurements on an experimental glass fracture surface and provide a metrological procedure for roughness measurements.},

	abstract = {We investigate experimentally and theoretically the dynamics of paramagnetic microrods anchored to a surface and driven by a precessing magnetic field. We identify two distinct regimes, corresponding to extended domains in the {(ω,θB)} plane, where ω and {θB} are, respectively, the frequency and inclination of the driving field. At low frequencies, the response of the rod is linear whatever is the inclination of the field, and the rod precesses at ω. However, above a characteristic frequency, two qualitatively different behaviors are distinguished, depending on the inclination {θB.} For small inclinations of the magnetic field, the response of the filament remains linear at all frequencies. Conversely, when {θB} exceeds a critical value {θBc∼55°}, the response becomes nonlinear, and the tip of the rod follows a complex trajectory exhibiting three-dimensional back-and-forth patterns. A minimal model, which neglects both the flexibility of the rod and the hydrodynamic interaction with the surface, 
correctly captures the main features of both regimes. We thus show that the complex trajectory patterns are chiefly due to the geometrical nonlinearities in the magnetic dipolar coupling. The critical angle is itself set by a purely geometrical criterium, arising from the magnetic nature of the rod. The paper is closed by a generalization of our results to the case of soft filaments.},

	abstract = {We introduce a model for yielding, inspired by fracture models and the
failure of a sheared granular medium in which the applied shear is
resisted by self-organized force chains. The force chains in the
granular medium {(GM)} are considered as a bundle of elastic brittle
fibres of finite failure strength. Upon the failure of any fibre, its
load is randomly redistributed amongst the remaining fibres. The model
provides an exponential distribution of the internal stress and a
log-normal shaped distribution of global failure stress, in agreement
with experimental observations. The model displays critical behaviour
which approaches mean field as the number of random neighbours k
becomes large and also displays a failure strength which remains
finite in the limit of infinite size. From comparison with different
models it is argued that this is an effect of non-correlation. All of
these macroscopic properties appear statistically stable with respect
to the choice of the chains' initial failure strength distribution.
The model investigated is relevant for all systems in which some
generic external load or pressure is borne by a number of units,
independent of one another except when failure of a unit causes load
transfer to some random choice of neighbouring units.},

It yields a final dry state which is either polycrystalline or amorphous.

	abstract = {Abstract  Intense damages as scabbing on front face, spalling on rear face, radial cracks are observed in concrete structures when subjected
to the impact of a kinetic striker. To characterize the dynamic strength and damage of concretes under such loadings one may
perform spalling tests and {EOI} (edge-on impact) tests. Both tests have been conducted with dry and wet specimens of a micro-concrete
named {MB50.} The tests revealed a remarked effect of strain-rate and free water on the dynamic response of the concrete. In
parallel, bending tests and direct tensile tests have been performed with dry and saturated concrete samples considering large
and small effective volumes and the results have been compared with five sets of data given in the literature with the same
material. A scale effect is observed in agreement with prediction of Weibull theory. Moreover, an anisotropic damage model
that describes the initiation of cracks and the obscuration of critical defects under high strain-rate tensile loading is
presented. It allows accounting for the influence of loading-rate and free-water on the dynamic strength and damage of concrete
observed in {EOI} and spalling tests.},

abstract ={During the deformation of rock in laboratory experiments, small 
cracking events, i.e., microfractures, occur which radiate elastic waves 
in a manner similar to earthquakes. These radiations were detected during 
uniaxial and triaxial compression tests and their frequency-magnitude relation studied. 
They were found to obey the Gutenberg and Richter relationWhere N is the number of events 
which occurred of magnitude M, and a and b constants. The dependence of the parameter 
b on rock type, stress, and confining pressure was studied. It was found to depend 
primarily on stress, in a characteristic way. The frequency-magnitude relation for events 
which accompanied frictional sliding and deformation of a ductile rock was found 
to have a much higher b value than that observed in brittle rock. 
The Gutenberg and Richter formulation of the frequency-magnitude relation was derived 
from a statistical model of rock and crustal deformation. This analysis demonstrates 
the basis of similarity between rock deformation experiments in the laboratory and 
deformation of the crust.},

Resorting to a real-space renormalization analysis, we show that in the absence of heterogeneity localization proceeds through a cascade of bifurcations which progressively concentrates the damage from the global interface to a narrow region leading to a crack nucleation. The equivalent homogeneous interface behaviour is obtained through this entire cascade, allowing for the analysis of size effects. When random heterogeneities are introduced in the interface, prior to the onset of localization damage proceeds by a sequence of avalanches whose mean size diverges at the first bifurcation point of the homogeneous interface. The large scale features of the bifurcation cascade are preserved, while the details of the late stage are smeared out by the randomness.},

We derive a scaling relation τa=2τ−1 between the local cluster exponent τa and the global avalanche exponent τ. For length scales longer than a crossover length proportional to the Larkin length, the aspect ratio of the local clusters scales with the roughness exponent of the line model. Our analysis provides an explanation for experimental results on planar crack avalanches in Plexiglas plates, but the results are applicable also to other systems with long-range interactions.},

	abstract = {Abstract  In this paper we propose a new algorithm to simulate the dynamics of {3-D} interacting rigid bodies. Six degrees of freedom
are introduced to describe a single {3-D} body or particle, and six relative motions and interactions are permitted between
bonded bodies. We develop a new decomposition technique for {3-D} rotation and pay particular attention to the fact that an
arbitrary relative rotation between two coordinate systems or two rigid bodies can not be decomposed into three mutually independent
rotations around three orthogonal axes. However, it can be decomposed into two rotations, one pure axial rotation around the
line between the centers of two bodies, and another rotation on a specified plane controlled by another parameter. These two
rotations, corresponding to the relative axial twisting and bending in our model, are sequence-independent. Therefore all
interactions due to the relative translational and rotational motions between linked bodies can be uniquely determined using
such a two-step decomposition technique. A complete algorithm for one such simulation is presented. Compared with existing
methods, this algorithm is physically more reliable and has greater numerical accuracy.},

Within an effectively infinite medium, a crack’s dynamics perfectly correspond to inertialess behavior predicted by linear elastic fracture mechanics. Once a crack interacts with waves that it generated at earlier times, this description breaks down. Cracks then acquire inertia and sluggishly accelerate. Crack inertia increases with crack speed v and diverges as v approaches its limiting value. We show that these dynamics are in excellent accord with an equation of motion derived in the limit of an infinite strip {[M.} Marder, Phys. Rev. Lett. 66, 2484 (1991)].},

	abstract = {It is shown that for collision cascades the global fractal dimension cannot give an adequate description of the geometrical structure because it is insensitive to the internal anisotropy of the object arising from the directionality of cascade branches. In order to give a more elaborate description of the cascade, we introduce an angular correlation function, which takes into account the direction of the local growth of the branches of the cascades. It is demonstrated that the angular correlation function gives a quantitative description of the directionality and the interrelation of branches of the cascade. The power law decay of the angular correlation is evidenced and characterized by an exponent β and an angular correlation length Ra different from the radius of gyration R. It is demonstrated that the overlapping of subcascades has a strong effect on the angular correlation.},

The model explicitly combines (a) an individual's perception of the advantages of an innovation and (b) social influence from members of the decision-maker's social network. The micro-level adoption dynamics are embedded into an agent-based model that allows exploration of macro-level patterns of technology diffusion throughout systems with different configurations (number and distributions of early adopters, social network topologies). In the present work we carry out many numerical simulations. We find that when the gap between the individual's perception of the options is high, the adoption speed increases if the dispersion of early adopters grows. Another test was based on changing the network topology by means of stochastic connections to a common opinion reference (hub), which resulted in an increment in the adoption speed. Finally, we 
performed a simulation of competition between options for both regular and small world networks.},

In this model, a number of seeds placed on random locations on a lattice are allowed to grow with a constant velocity to form clusters. When two or more clusters eventually touch each other they immediately stop their growth. The model exhibits a discontinuous transition for very low values of the seed concentration \$p\$ and a second, non-trivial continuous phase transition for intermediate \$p\$ values. Here we study in detail this continuous transition that separates a phase of finite clusters from a phase characterized by the presence of a giant component. Using finite size scaling and large scale Monte Carlo simulations we determine the value of the percolation threshold where the giant component first appears, and the critical exponents that characterize the transition. We find that the transition belongs to a different universality class from the standard percolation transition.},

  abstract={We study the statistics of records of a one-dimensional random walk of n steps, starting from the origin, and in the presence of a constant bias c . At each time step, the walker makes a random jump of length η drawn from a continuous distribution f (η), which is symmetric around a constant drift c . We focus in particular on the case where f (η) is a symmetric stable law with a Lévy index 0 < μ ⩽ 2. The record statistics crucially depends on the persistence probability, which, as we show here, exhibits different behaviors depending on the sign of c and the value of the parameter μ. Hence, in the limit of a large number of steps n , the record statistics is sensitive to these parameters ( c and μ) of the jump distribution. We compute the asymptotic mean record number 〈 R n 〉 after n steps as well as its full distribution P ( R , n ). We also compute the statistics of the ages of the longest and the shortest lasting record. Our exact computations show the existence of five distinct regions in the ( c , 0 < μ ⩽ 2) strip where these quantities display qualitatively different behaviors. We also present numerical simulation results that verify our analytical predictions.}

During the process of tunnel excavations or other underground construction, the rock will be exposed suddenly, and such sudden unloading process will cause crack expansion and destabilize the rock structure. In order to investigate the crack behaviour during this process, a true triaxial loading apparatus with a computer-controlled electrohydraulic servosystem was established, and a series of true triaxial loading and unloading experiments was conducted by using concrete specimens containing inclined cracks with inclinations of 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 75°. The stress-strain behavior and the failure property of rock models during unloading process were obtained, and, additionally, the coefficient of brittle stress drop was investigated. The uniaxial compression tests were simulated by using finite element method.},

	abstract = {Mother of pearl, or nacre, is one of a number of characteristic skeletal structures of molluscs, occurring in cephalopods, gastropods and bivalves. It consists of plates of aragonite, about 0.3 \${\textbackslash}mu \$m thick, arranged in sheets, with a tenuous protein matrix. Mechanical tests of nacre from all three classes show that it has a tensile strength of between 35 and 110 {MN} m\${\textasciicircum}{-2}\$. It is slightly viscoelastic, and shows marked, though not extensive, plastic deformation. The maximum measured strain was 0.018. While undergoing plastic deformation the material shows considerable optical changes. The regions where plastic flow is occurring show 'tension lines', probably equivalent to similar lines in bone. These are probably caused by voids forming in the protein matrix. The work of fracture is very different in different loading directions, being about 1.65 \${\textbackslash}times \$ 10\${\textasciicircum}{3}\$ J m\${\textasciicircum}{-2}\$ when fractured across the 
grain, and 1.5 \${\textbackslash}times \$ 10\${\textasciicircum}{2}\$ J m\${\textasciicircum}{-2}\$ when fractured along it. Nacre shows considerable ability to stop cracks. An attempt is made to explain qualitatively the mechanical behaviour of nacre in terms of its submicroscopic structure. It is concluded that the precise geometric arrangement of the plates is most important, and that this constraint may make nacre less suitable for shells that must be built quickly.},

	abstract = {We investigate the predictability of extreme events in a dissipative {Olami-Feder-Christensen} model on a small world topology. Due to the mechanism of self-organized criticality, it is impossible to predict the magnitude of the next event knowing previous ones, if the system has an infinite size. However, by exploiting the finite size effects, we show that probabilistic predictions of the occurrence of extreme events in the next time step are possible in a finite system. In particular, the finiteness of the system unavoidably leads to repulsive temporal correlations of extreme events. The predictability of those is higher for larger magnitudes and for larger complex network sizes. Finally, we show that our prediction analysis is also robust by remarkably reducing the accessible number of events used to construct the optimal predictor.},

	abstract = {Nanoparticle agglomeration in a quiescent fluid is simulated by solving the Langevin equations of motion of a set of interacting monomers in the continuum regime. Monomers interact via a radial rapidly decaying intermonomer potential. The morphology of generated clusters is analyzed through their fractal dimension df and the cluster coordination number. The time evolution of the cluster fractal dimension is linked to the dynamics of two populations: small (k≤15) and large (k{\textgreater}15) clusters. At early times monomer-cluster agglomeration is the dominant agglomeration mechanism (df=2.25), whereas at late times cluster-cluster agglomeration dominates (df=1.56). Clusters are found to be compact (mean coordination number of ∼5), tubular, and elongated. The local compact structure of the aggregates is attributed to the isotropy of the interaction potential, which allows rearrangement of bonded monomers, whereas the large-scale tubular structure is attributed to its relatively short attractive 
range. The cluster translational diffusion coefficient is determined to be inversely proportional to the cluster mass and the (per-unit-mass) friction coefficient of an isolated monomer, a consequence of the neglect of monomer shielding in a cluster. Clusters generated by unshielded Langevin equations are referred to as ideal clusters because the surface area accessible to the underlying fluid is found to be the sum of the accessible surface areas of the isolated monomers. Similarly, ideal clusters do not have, on average, a preferential orientation. The decrease in the numbers of clusters with time and a few collision kernel elements are evaluated and compared to analytical expressions.},

	abstract = {We present molecular dynamics simulation results for the translational dynamics of a simple model ferrofluid under the influence of a homogeneous magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that the anisotropic, yet normal diffusive behavior seen in weakly coupled systems and finite fields becomes anomalous both parallel and perpendicular to the field at sufficiently high dipolar coupling and field strength. After the initial ballistic regime, chain formation along the field first yields cage-like motion in all directions, followed by transient, mixed diffusive-superdiffusive behavior resulting from cooperative, directed motion. We also find evidence for dynamic heterogeneities.},

These calculations reproduce several surprising features of experimental results. In most cases, the frictional force on a solid monolayer has a different form from that observed between macroscopic solids. No threshold force or static friction is needed to initiate sliding; instead, the velocity is proportional to the force. As in experiments, incommensurate solid layers actually slide more readily than fluid layers. A comparison of experiment, simulation, and analytic results shows that dissipation arises from anharmonic coupling between phonon modes and substrate-induced deformations in the adsorbate.},

	abstract = {The structure transition in cluster-cluster aggregation {(CCA)} under different external electric fields has been investigated by computer simulations. The aggregates are generated from off-lattice {CCA} models involving the field-induced dipolar interactions and temperatures by means of a Metropolis algorithm. When the parameter K increases from 0 to ∞, the clusters gradually change from a diffusion-limited {CCA} to a chainlike pattern, where K stands for the relative strength of the field-induced dipolar interaction with thermal energy. The relation of fractal dimension Df to parameter K can be approximately expressed as {Df=DE+(DDLCA-DE)e-βK} with β=0.64, where {DE} and {DDLCA} stand for the fractal dimensions of the {CCA} when K⃗∞ and K⃗0, respectively. This structure transition is a transition between a prototype disorder structure and a relative order one. The transition is attributed to the variation of the dominating interaction of systems from thermal disorder to field-induced dipolar 
interaction with K rising.},

For suitable surface separations, strong fields directed perpendicular to the film plane do not only align the particles but create additional layers in the system. The reverse effect occurs with an in-plane field which can induce a collapse of layers. Both effects are accompanied by pronounced particle rearrangements in lateral directions. Our simulation results are consistent with recent experiments of ferrofluids at surfaces.},

Introducing the caliper diameter to take into account large displacements of atoms in a collision cascade, it is possible to describe this fragmentation in terms of a threshold energy Ec. From the knowledge of Ec, the number and the volume fraction of subcascades produced is then derived. This last information allows us to classify the efficiency of impinging particles to induce structural changes of solids.},

For the {Sherrington-Kirkpatrick} {(SK)} spin-glass it yields the density {rho(S)} of the sizes of magnetization jumps S along the equilibrium magnetization curve at zero temperature. Continuous replica-symmetry breaking allows for a power-law behavior {rho(S)} {\textasciitilde} {1/(S){\textasciicircum}tau} with exponent tau=1 for {SK}, related to the criticality (marginal stability) of the spin-glass phase. All scales of the ultrametric phase space are implicated in jump events. Similar results are obtained for the sizes S of static jumps of pinned elastic systems, or of shocks in Burgers turbulence in large dimension. In all cases with a one-step solution, {rho(S)} {\textasciitilde} S {exp(-A} S{\textasciicircum}2). A simple interpretation relating droplets to shocks, and a scaling theory for the equilibrium analog of 
Barkhausen noise in finite-dimensional spin glasses are discussed.},

In both situations, the time required for crack formation obeys an Arrhenius law, from which the energy barrier and prefactor are extracted for different system sizes. For large systems, the characteristic time of rupture is found to decrease with system size, in agreement with classical Weibull theory. In the case of zero shear modulus, the energy opposing rupture is identified with the breakage of a single atomic bond. In the case of nonzero shear modulus, thermally activated fracture can only be studied within a reasonable time at very high strains. In this case, the energy barrier is much higher compared to the zero shear modulus case. This barrier is understood within adiabatic simulations.},

	abstract = {Particles interacting by a combination of isotropic short-range attraction and long-range repulsion have been shown to form complex phases despite the apparent simplicity of the interparticle potential. Using computer simulations we study the behavior of two-dimensional systems of colloids with such an interaction, focusing on how area fraction and repulsion range at fixed repulsion gradient may be used to tune the resulting kinetics and nonequilibrium structure. While the short-range attraction leads to aggregation, the long-range repulsion encourages growth of chains of particles due to repulsive intercluster interactions. Depending on area fraction/repulsion range we observe chain labyrinths, chain-compact aggregate coexistence, and connected networks of chains. The kinetics of cluster growth displays a sequence of connected networks and disconnected cluster or chain systems with increasing repulsion range, indicating the competing roles of connectivity of growing chains and repulsion-driven 
breakup of chains into compact aggregates. Chain-dominated systems show approximately logarithmic coarsening at late time that we interpret as the result of chains performing random walks in the randomly fluctuating potential landscape created by their neighbors, a situation reminiscent of glassy systems.},

	abstract = {A laser speckle technique, together with a computer-based image processing system, was used to measure the extent of the elastic-plastic boundary ahead of a static mode 1 crack under small-scale yielding. The technique used a simple optical set-up and did not require surface contact with the specimen. A recently proposed correlation parameter called the Integrated Peak Spectral Intensity Hi, was used to correlate the speckle images obtained with the state of strain around a crack tip and the subsequent mapping of the plastic zone. The experimentally obtained plastic zone around a narrow slit obtained by this technique showed reasonable agreement with predictions using Inglis' solution. For a fatigue crack, the extent of the experimental plastic zone ahead of a sharp crack was as expected larger than that predicted by linear elastic fracture mechanics, but agreed well with results corrected for load shedding at the crack tip. The present results indicate that the extent of the elastic-plastic 
boundary can be measured accurately with the laser speckle technique.},

	abstract = {This inaugural article has a twofold purpose: (i) to present a simpler and more general justification of the fundamental scaling laws of quasibrittle fracture, bridging the asymptotic behaviors of plasticity, linear elastic fracture mechanics, and Weibull statistical theory of brittle failure, and (ii) to give a broad but succinct overview of various applications and ramifications covering many fields, many kinds of quasibrittle materials, and many scales (from 10–8 to 106 m). The justification rests on developing a method to combine dimensional analysis of cohesive fracture with second-order accurate asymptotic matching. This method exploits the recently established general asymptotic properties of the cohesive crack model and nonlocal Weibull statistical model. The key idea is to select the dimensionless variables in such a way that, in each asymptotic case, all of them vanish except one. The minimal nature of the hypotheses made explains the surprisingly broad applicability of the scaling 
laws.

The recently discovered giant electrorheological {(GER)} effect breaks the upper bound of the traditional {ER} effect, but a microscopic explanation is still lacking. By using molecular dynamics to simulate the urea-silicone oil mixture trapped in a nanocontact between two polarizable particles, we demonstrate that the electric field can induce the formation of aligned (urea) dipolar filaments that bridge the two boundaries of the nanoscale confinement. This phenomenon is explainable on the basis of a {3D} to {1D} crossover in urea molecules’ microgeometry, realized through the confinement effect provided by the oil chains. The resulting electrical energy density yields an excellent account of the observed {GER} yield stress variation as a function of the electric field.},

	abstract = {{CoFe2O4} nanoparticles are ferrimagnetic and {p-MgFe2O4} nanoparticles are paramagnetic. Binary ferrofluids can be synthesized by mixing {CoFe2O4} ferrofluids and {p-MgFe2O4} fluids in such a way that the magnetic interaction of the {CoFe2O4} particles is large enough to form field-induced chainlike aggregates. The field modulation of light transmission through films of {CoFe2O4–p-MgFe2O4} binary ferrofluids with different values of applied magnetic field is compared with pure {CoFe2O4} ferrofluids. The experimental results revealed that the light transmission coefficient of binary ferrofluids can be more intensely modulated by an external magnetic field than pure {CoFe2O4} ferrofluids. These show that in the binary ferrofluids, the field-induced structure mainly arises from the {CoFe2O4} nanoparticle system and the {p-MgFe2O4} nanoparticles introduce a nonlinear modulation effect, even though the microstructure of {p-MgFe2O4} fluids is not affected by an applied magnetic field. Using a model 
of magnetic bidispersal, the enhanced field modulation of the light transmission through binary ferrofluids is explained by the coupling of geometric shadowing effects from both the {CoFe2O4} and {p-MgFe2O4} particle systems.},

The constraint of isometric deformations in these ribbonlike structures that follows from the geometric separation of scales introduces a coupling between bending and torsional degrees of freedom. Using analytical techniques and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the tangent-tangent correlation functions always exhibit an oscillatory decay at any finite temperature implying the existence of an underlying helical structure even in the absence of a preferential zero-temperature twist. In addition, the persistence length is found to be over 3 times larger than that of a wormlike chain having the same bending rigidity. Our results are applicable to many ribbonlike objects in polymer physics and nanoscience that cannot be described by the classical wormlike chain model.},

The method is based on the relaxation-dynamics of the spring-block system and reveals in a hierarchical manner region-like entities at different spatial scales. It takes into account in an elegant manner both the spatiality of the elements and the connectivity relations among them. Spatiality is taken into account by using the geographic coordinates of the settlements, and by detecting the neighbors with the help of a Delaunay triangulation. Connectivity between neighboring settlements are quantified using a Pearson-like correlation for the relative variation of a relevant socio-economic parameter (population size, {GDP}, tax payed per inhabitant, etc.). The method is implemented in an interactive {JAVA} application and it is applied with success for an artificially generated society and for the case of {USA}, Hungary and Transylvania.},

Universal scaling properties of this distribution have been evidenced for entire catalogs and seismic sequences. Recently, these universal features have been questioned and some criticisms have been raised. We investigate the existence of universal scaling properties by analyzing a Californian catalog and by means of numerical simulations of an epidemic-type model. We show that the interevent time distribution exhibits a universal behavior over the entire temporal range if four characteristic times are taken into account. The above analysis allows us to identify the scaling form leading to universal behavior and explains the observed deviations. Furthermore, it provides a tool to identify the dependence on the mainshock magnitude of the c parameter that fixes the onset of the power law decay in the Omori law.},

Our results for prenotched samples indicate that the crack surface is statistically isotropic, with the implication that experimental findings of anisotropy of fracture surface roughness in directions parallel and perpendicular to crack propagation is not due to the scalar or vectorial elasticity of the model. In contrast to scalar fuse lattices, beam lattice systems do not exhibit anomalous scaling or an extra dependence of roughness on system size. The local and global roughness exponents (ζloc and ζ, respectively) are equal to each other, and the three-dimensional crack roughness exponent is estimated to be ζloc=ζ=0.48±0.03. This closely matches the roughness exponent observed outside the fracture process zone. The probability density distribution p[Δh(ℓ)] of the height differences Δh(ℓ)=[h(x+ℓ)−h(x)] of the crack profile follows a Gaussian distribution, in agreement with experimental results.},

The corresponding notch-size effect on fracture strength is in good agreement with the experimental tests performed on notched sheets of different kinds of paper. In particular, we find that there is no stress concentration if the fractal dimension of the fiber network is D⩽d-0.5, where d is the topological dimension of the paper sheet.},

	abstract = {Recently there has been some suggestions that fragmentation of thin brittle sheets is qualitatively different from pure two-dimensional fragmentation. The obvious reason for such a discrepancy is the possibility of the sheet to deform out of plane. There is a generic crack-branching mechanism that creates power-law fragment size distribution in the small fragment range for two-dimensional {(2D)} and three-dimensional bulk fragmentation with the power exponent {(2D−1)/D.} For thin sheets, the power exponent seems to be close to 1.2 which differs from the D=2 exponent 1.5. In order to make a distinct separation between sheet and {2D} fragmentation, high-resolution fragment size distributions are required for fragmentation models with minimal differencies other than dimensionality. Here a very efficient numerical model which can be switched from {2D} fragmentation to out-of-plane sheet fragmentation with minimal changes is used to produce high-resolution fragment size distribution for the two cases.
 The model results cast some doubt on the existence of separate universality classes for sheet and {2D} fragmentation.},

However, temporal and spatial correlations of real earthquakes are not correctly described by this model in its original form. I propose and study a modified version of the model, which includes a mechanism of structural relaxation. With this modification, realistic features of seismicity emerge, which are not obtained with the original version, mainly: aftershocks that cluster spatially around the slip surface of the main shock and follow the Omori law, and averaged frictional properties similar to those observed in rock friction, in particular the velocity-weakening effect. In addition, a {Gutenberg-Richter} law for the decaying of number of earthquakes with magnitude is obtained, with a decaying exponent within the range of experimentally observed values. Contrary to the 
original version of the model, a realistic value of the exponent appears without the necessity to fine tune any parameter.},

At a very high impact velocity only a small hole is created at the impact area {(Hertzian} fracture). At lower velocities tangential and radial cracks are formed. In the model calculations, pure Hertzian fracture appears in the limit where inertial forces dominate over the elastic forces, while tangential fracture appears in the opposite limit. Radial cracks are demonstrated to be a consequence of nonlinear deformations or an externally applied in-plane strain.},

	abstract = {In living organisms, branching structures are often observed in open systems. During the process of structure formation/deformation, signal propagation can be observed. Branching paths often deform depending on the history of signal propagation. To gain a better understanding of the process of pattern formation that results in characteristic geometrical paths, we adopt a system in which the dynamics of path formation are correlated with signal propagation. This model involves both branch-generation dynamics and signal-propagation dynamics, and we introduced positive feedback between these two dynamic processes. We studied the geometrical properties of path deformation and the pattern of signal propagation using a discretized reaction-diffusion model. The proposed model can qualitatively reproduce different branching patterns and means of signal propagation. One remarkable result is that the mutual interaction of these two dynamic processes leads to autonomous wave generation, similar to a 
pacemaker or the generation of spiral waves. Because the autonomous wave generation in the signal is spontaneous, the shapes of the branching paths become distorted. We discuss the correlation between path deformation and signal propagation as a first step in understanding signal processing for such complex deformable paths.},

Experiments conducted with aluminum sheets show that the number of cracks is selected at the beginning of the perforation process and then remains stable. A simple model predicts the number of cracks as the result of a competition between the elastic energy stored in the sheet, and the energy dissipated during crack extension. We also evidence the subtle rearrangements of randomly distributed cracks into uniform radial patterns with fewer cracks. In that respect, this study exemplifies how relaxation mechanisms in fragmenting solids can attenuate the influence of defects in the material.},

A recent paper by Achlioptas et al. {[Science} 323, 1453 (2009)] showed that the percolation transition, which is usually continuous, becomes discontinuous (“explosive”) if links are added to the system according to special cooperative rules {(Achlioptas} processes). In this paper, we present a detailed numerical analysis of Achlioptas processes with product rule on various systems, including lattices, random networks á la {Erdös-Rényi}, and scale-free networks. In all cases, we recover the explosive transition by Achlioptas et al. However, the explosive percolation transition is kind of hybrid as, despite the discontinuity of the order parameter at the threshold, one observes traces of analytical behavior such as power-law distributions of cluster sizes. In particular, for scale-free networks with degree exponent λ{\textless}3, all relevant percolation variables display power-law scaling, just as in continuous second-order 
phase transitions.},

Moreover, the reloaded region becomes a narrower and narrower `cone', so that the damage in this cone becomes closer and closer to the so-called global load sharing rule used, for instance, to study a fiber bundle. This constitutes a formal justification of the relevance of such a mean-field approach as the peak stress is approached.},

In this model, a number of seeds placed on random locations on the lattice are allowed to grow with a constant velocity to form clusters. When two or more clusters eventually touch each other they immediately stop their growth. The model exhibits a discontinuous transition for very low values of the seed concentration p and a second, nontrivial continuous phase transition for intermediate p values. Here we study in detail this continuous transition that separates a phase of finite clusters from a phase characterized by the presence of a giant component. Using finite size scaling and large scale Monte Carlo simulations we determine the value of the percolation threshold where the giant component first appears, and the critical exponents that characterize the transition. We find that the transition belongs to a different universality class from the standard percolation transition.},

	abstract = {In a layer of grains that interact through a tunable dipolar force, we show that an instability occurs due to the competition between gravity and the interaction between grains. Above a critical intensity of the interaction, the flat surface of the layer is unstable and peaks are generated. Fluctuations are shown to have conflicting effects. On the one hand, they favor the instability process and for large enough fluctuations the peak amplitude behaves similarly to the order parameter of a supercritical instability. On the other hand, the spatial organization of the peaks is affected by fluctuations that postpone the appearance of spatial ordering.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Due to their brittleness, assembling of ceramics pieces is generally achieved through brazing but thermal stresses during
cooling frequently induce cracking of the material used for brazing. In order to check if such damage is avoidable, it is
necessary to characterize the brittle to ductile transition {(BDT)} of the material. Simple compression is not suited for crack
studies, because of mixed loading (mode {II}  +  compressive mode I cracking). Another type of test, the cylinder splitting
test, known as the Brazilian test, can be carried out by applying compressive forces on two opposite generatrix of a cylinder:
this causes a uniform tensile stress on the plane containing the axis of the cylinder and the generatrix, leading to mode
I cracking. The advantage of this test is to avoid expensive and random machining of brittle samples. This study shows that
the Brazilian test is well adapted for the measurement of toughness and the characterization of the {BDT} of materials whose
room temperature behaviour is brittle (silicides, intermetallics etc.).},

The {DNA-encoded} linkages between particles theoretically allow for very high specificity, but generally no directionality or long-range interactions. We introduce a two-dimensional lattice model for particles of many different types with short-range isotropic interactions that are pairwise specific. For this class of models, of which the {DNA-coated} colloids are one example, we address the fundamental question whether it is possible to reliably design the interactions so that the ground state is unique and corresponds to a given crystal structure. First, we determine lower limits for the interaction range between particles, depending on the complexity of the desired pattern and the underlying lattice. Then, we introduce a proof-of-principle “recipe” for determining the pairwise interactions that exactly satisfies this minimum criterion, and we show that it is sufficient to uniquely determine the 
ground state for a large class of crystal structures. Finally, we verify these results using Monte Carlo simulations.},

	abstract = {We study the propagation of brittle fractures coupled to large out-of-plane bending, as when a brittle elastic thin sheet is cut by a moving object. Taking into account the separation of the film’s bending and stretching energies and using fracture theory we show that such cracks propagate according to a simple set of geometrical rules in the limit of small thickness. In particular, this provides some insight into the geometrical origin of the oscillatory fracture patterns reported in two recent experiments. Numerical integration of our geometrical rules accurately reproduces both the shape of the fracture pattern and the detailed time evolution of the propagation of the crack tip, for various geometries of the cutting object.},

	abstract = {When a piece of metal is fractured either by tensile or impact loading (pulling or hitting), the fracture surface that is formed is rough and irregular. Its shape is affected by the metal's microstructure (such as grains, inclusions and precipitates, whose characteristic length is large relative to the atomic scale), as well as by 'macrostructural' influences (such as the size, the shape of the specimen, and the notch from which the fracture begins). However, repeated observation at various magnifications also reveals a variety of additional structures that fall between the 'micro' and the 'macro' and have not yet been described satisfactorily in a systematic manner. The experiments reported here reveal the existence of broad and clearly distinct zone of intermediate scales in which the structure is modelled very well by a fractal surface. A new method, slit island analysis, is introduced to estimate the basic quantity called the fractal dimension, D. The estimate is shown to agree with the 
value obtained by fracture profile analysis, a spectral method. Finally, D is shown to be a measure of toughness in metals.},

We have found, (i) the maximum amplitudes of AE events during stable sliding are strongly dependent on the surface roughness with smooth-ground surfaces giving smaller maximum AE amplitudes; (ii) b-values are related to the surface topographic fractal dimensions, so that in steady-state stable sliding smooth surfaces exhibit lower b-values than rough surfaces; (iii) the b-value falls before stick-slip instability. The change of b with slip we interpret in terms of evolving fractal crack damage during frictional sliding of the fault surfaces.},

discrete grain structure of the concrete was generated assuming the grains to be spherical. The load versus {CMOD} plots thus
simulated agreed reasonably well with the experimental results. Moreover, acoustic emission {(AE)} hits were recorded during
the test and compared with the number of fractured lattice elements. It was found that the cumulative {AE} hits correlated well
with the cumulative fractured lattice elements at all load levels thus providing a useful means for predicting when the micro-cracks

using quaternion and a complete set of interactions is permitted between two bonded particles, i.e., normal and tangent forces,
rolling and torsional torques. Relative rotation between two particles is decomposed into two sequence-independent rotations,
such that an overall torsional and rolling angle can be distinguished and torques caused by relative rotations are uniquely
determined. Forces and torques are calculated in a finite deformation fashion, rather than incrementally. Compared with the
incremental methods our algorithm is numerically more stable while it is consistent with the non-commutativity of finite rotations.
We study the macroscopic elastic properties of a regularly arranged {2-D} and {3-D} lattice. Using a micro-to-macro approach based
on the existence of a homogeneous displacement field, we study the problem of how to choose the particle-scale parameters
(normal, tangent, rolling and torsional stiffness) given the macroscopic elastic parameters and geometry of lattice arrangement.
The method is validated by reproducing the wing crack propagation and the fracture patterns under uniaxial compression. This
study will provide a theoretical basis for the calibration of the {DEM} parameters required in engineering applications.},

However, if we consider the “fault system” consisting of all models, damaged and undamaged, we get excellent scaling with the exponent depending on the relative frequency with which faults with a particular amount of damage occur in the fault system. This paradigm combines the idea that {Gutenberg-Richter} scaling is associated with an underlying critical point with the notion that the structure of a fault system also affects the statistical distribution of earthquakes. In addition, it provides a framework in which the variation, from one tectonic region to another, of the scaling exponent, or b value, can be understood.},

        abstract = {Characterizing the mechanical response of the human amnion is essential to understand and to eventually prevent premature rupture of fetal membranes. In this study, a large set of macroscopic and microscopic mechanical tests have been carried out on fresh unfixed amnion to gain insight into the time-dependent material response and the underlying mechanisms. Creep and relaxation responses of amnion were characterized in macroscopic uniaxial tension, biaxial tension and inflation configurations. For the first time, these experiments were complemented by microstructural information from nonlinear laser scanning microscopy performed during in situ uniaxial relaxation tests. The amnion showed large tension reduction during relaxation and small inelastic strain accumulation in creep. The short-term relaxation response was related to a concomitant in-plane and out-of-plane contraction, and was dependent on the testing configuration. The microscopic investigation revealed a large volume reduction at the beginning, but no change of volume was measured long-term during relaxation. Tension–strain curves normalized with respect to the maximum strain were highly repeatable in all configurations and allowed the quantification of corresponding characteristic parameters. The present data indicate that dissipative behavior of human amnion is related to two mechanisms: (i) volume reduction due to water outflow (up to ∼20 s) and (ii) long-term dissipative behavior without macroscopic deformation and no systematic global reorientation of collagen fibers.},

The time-dependent cluster-size distribution (in both two- and three-dimensional systems) can be well represented by the dynamic scaling form for the cluster-size distribution {Ns(t)=s-2f(s/S(t))} where Ns(t) is the number of clusters of size s at time t. The mean cluster size S(t) diverges as S(t)∼tz. The value of the exponent z is found to agree with the mean-field Smoluchowski result z=1/(1-γ) in d≥dc=2 dimensions, where dc is the upper critical dimension, and γ is the exponent describing the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the cluster mass. Below dc, we find that our results agree with the expression z=d/(2-dγ). At high particle densities, a crossover from two or three dimensions to one-dimensional behavior is observed.},

In this paper, the application of a mesh-free method, called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics {(SPH)}, is demonstrated for simulating rock caving in a stratified deposit. The advantages for simulating caving processes using a mesh-free numerical framework are highlighted. Two different examples are chosen, one with elastic-brittle material behaviour with large yield strength (failure by brittle fracture) and the other with elasto-plastic material behaviour with relatively lower yield strength to allow ductile deformation of the rock mass. The modelling results capture the mechanistic aspects observed in caving processes. It is shown that the large-scale deformation and the associated fracture processes in caving can be effectively simulated using {SPH.} In the authors' knowledge, this work 
is the first attempt in demonstrating the application of a mesh-free method for simulating caving processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Sea-ice floe-size distribution {(FSD)} in ice-pack covered seas influences many aspects of ocean-atmosphere interactions. However, data concerning {FSD} in the polar oceans are still sparse and processes shaping the observed {FSD} properties are poorly understood. Typically, power-law {FSDs} are assumed although no feasible explanation has been provided neither for this one nor for other properties of the observed distributions. Consequently, no model exists capable of predicting {FSD} parameters in any particular situation. Here I show that the observed {FSDs} can be well represented by a truncated Pareto distribution P(x)=x−1−α exp[(1−α)/x], which is an emergent property of a certain group of multiplicative stochastic systems, described by the generalized {Lotka-Volterra} {(GLV)} equation. Building upon this recognition, a possibility of developing a simple agent-based {GLV-type} sea-ice model is considered. Contrary to simple power-law {FSDs}, {GLV} gives consistent estimates of the total 
floe perimeter, as well as floe-area distribution in agreement with observations.},

This paper presents a strategy to model heterogeneous brittle structures composed of binder and aggregate using the Discrete Element Method {(DEM).} A discretisation concept for both components was developed and implemented using spherical particles as discrete elements. The aggregate grains were modelled by clusters of these particles. Special routines were developed to generate specimens, to simulate laboratory tests and to analyse these simulations. Methods were developed to calibrate homogeneous and heterogeneous material by the determination of appropriate constitutive laws and their corresponding parameters. The simulation strategy allows to distinguish in detail between inter- and intra-granular microfracturing, between shear- and tensile-cracking and between microcracks within or between the 
different components of the heterogeneous material. Exemplarily, selected simulation results are presented for {MgO-concrete.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}}},

The pebbles in the till are angular. At a point seven miles south the pebbles are spheroidal. From this point southward the beach pebbles are progressively flatter. This difference in shape is attributed to two processes, namely, wear and selective transportation. It is proved that angular pebbles become round, and round pebbles become flat. By laboratory experiments it is shown that flat pebbles travel more readily by wave action than round pebbles because of differences in behavior due to differences in shape, and to the fact that round pebbles seek deeper water and are consequently more readily buried.},

We show that our model is realistic, since the bulk of the collisions falls into this category.}
