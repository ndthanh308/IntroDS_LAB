abstract = {Observations of single pulses imply that the circular polarization (CP) at a fixed pulsar phase, in some pulsars, can be large and variable from pulse to pulse. In many cases the variations can include changes in the handedness at a fixed phase. Possible explanations for the variable CP are sought in terms of elliptical polarization of the natural wave modes. The pulsar plasma is assumed to be a highly relativistically streaming, one-dimensional, strongly magnetized, electron-positron gas with a net charge density and intrinsically relativistic random motions in its rest frame. It is shown that in such a plasma the polarization of the natural modes includes two regimes where intrinsically relativistic effects determine the CP. One regime arises from aberration causing a small cone of CP about the backward (anti-streaming) direction in the rest frame to expand into the forward hemisphere in the pulsar frame. This mechanism can lead to significant CP at relatively high frequencies. The other mechanism arises from the intrinsically relativistic random motions, which allow a new regime of CP that has no counterpart in a cold plasma; however, for typical parameters this mechanism is effective only at frequencies higher than is consistent with our neglect of the cyclotron resonance. It is suggested that the explanation for the observed CP requires that the CP arise as a propagation effect, and be determined by the properties of the wave modes at a polarization limiting region.},

abstract = {Radio pulsar polarization exhibits a number of complex phenomena that are classified into the realm of ‘beyond the rotating vector model' (RVM). It is shown that these effects can be understood in geometrical terms, as a result of coherent and quasi-coherent addition of elliptically polarized natural mode waves. The coherent summation implies that the observed tracks of polarization angle (PA) do not always correspond to the natural propagation mode (NPM) waves. Instead, they are statistical average of coherent sum of the NPM waves, and can be observed at any (and frequency-dependent) distance from the natural modes. Therefore, the observed tracks of PA can wander arbitrarily far from the RVM, and may be non-orthogonal. For equal amplitudes of the NPM waves two pairs of orthogonal polarization modes (OPMs), displaced by 45◦ , can be observed, depending on the width of lag distribution. Observed pulsar polarization mainly results from two independent effects: the change of mode amplitude ratio and the change of phase lag. In the core region both effects are superposed on each other, which can produce so complex behaviour as observed in the cores of PSR B1933+16, B1237+25, and J0437−4715. Change of the phase lag with frequency $\nu$ is mostly responsible for the observed strong evolution of these features with $\nu$. The coherent addition of orthogonal natural waves is a useful interpretive tool for the observed radio pulsar polarization.},

abstract = {The discovery of pulsars opened a new research field that allows studying a wide range of physics under extreme conditions. More than 3,000 pulsars are currently known, including especially more than 200 of them studied at gamma-ray frequencies. By putting recent insights into the pulsar magnetosphere in a historical context and by comparing them to key observational features at radio and high-energy frequencies, we show the following: Magnetospheric structure of young energetic pulsars is now understood. Limitations still exist for old nonrecycled and millisecond pulsars. The observed high-energy radiation is likely produced in the magnetospheric current sheet beyond the light cylinder. There are at least two different radio emission mechanisms. One operates in the inner magnetosphere, whereas the other one works near the light cylinder and is specific to pulsars with the high magnetic field strength in that region. Radio emission from the inner magnetosphere is intrinsically connected to the process of pair production, and its observed properties contain the imprint of both the geometry and propagation effects through the magnetospheric plasma. We discuss the limitations of our understanding and identify a range of observed phenomena and physical processes that still await explanation in thefuture. This includes connecting the magnetospheric processes to spin-down properties to explain braking and possible evolution of spin orientation, building a first-principles model of radio emission and quantitative connections with observations.},

abstract = {Pulsar radio emission and its polarization are observed to evolve with frequency. This frequency dependence is key to the emission mechanism and the structure of the radio beam. With the new ultra-wideband receiver (UWL) on the Parkes radio telescope we are able, for the first time, to observe how pulsar profiles evolve over a broad continuous bandwidth of 700–4000 MHz. We describe here a technique for processing broad-band polarimetric observations to establish a meaningful alignment and visualize the data across the band. We apply this to observations of PSRs J1056–6258 and J1359–6038, chosen due to previously unresolved questions about the frequency evolution of their emission. Application of our technique reveals that it is possible to align the polarization position angle (PA) across a broad frequency range when constrained to applying only corrections for dispersion and Faraday rotation to do so. However, this does not correspond to aligned intensity profiles for these two sources. We find that it is possible to convert these misalignments into emission height range estimates that are consistent with published and simulated values, suggesting that they can be attributed to relativistic effects in the magnetosphere. We discuss this work in the context of the radio beam structure and prepare the ground for a wider study of pulsar emission using broad-band polarimetric data.},

abstract = {Refraction and polarization transfer in an ultrarelativistic highly magnetized pulsar plasma are considered. Normal waves in the pulsar plasma are linearly polarized however circular polarization arises in the polarization limiting region if radiation propagates at an angle to the plane of the magnetic field lines. The rays go off this plane due to refraction or (and) due to rotation of the magnetosphere. We found significant circular polarization of the outgoing radiation, in some cases with the sense reversal near the pulse centre. The frequency dependence of the circular polarization qualitatively resembles that observed. The swing of position angle of linear polarization is studied allowing for the wave propagation in the polarization-limiting region. The influence of refraction on the total-intensity profiles is examined as well. It is shown that refraction can provide the angular separation of emitted rays, so that the whole morphological classification of pulsar profiles can be explained within the frame of the primordial hollow-cone emission model taking into account wave propagation in the magnetosphere.},

@article{Michel1987,
abstract = {We propose a model for pulsar emission which suggests a number of tests based on existing data and additional tests given future data sets. We reexamine the idea of pulsar emission in the form of coherent curvature radiation from particle "bunches" following curved magnetic field lines near the neutron star, where the field lines are assumed not to be purely dipolar. The radiation is assumed to be concentrated on relatively narrow isolated flux tubes which generate wide individual fan beams. A given pulsar may rotate into view several such beams, leading to complex pulse profiles. The circular polarization profiles of many pulsars, wherein the sense of circular polarization reverses at maximum total intensity, are directly obtained if a single flux tube dominates the output. The " orthogonal " mode changes (often taken to represent complex emission processes) are here interpreted as arising from the overlap of two fan beams, hence possibly a geometric effect (strict orthog-onality is not guaranteed). The inferred Lorentz factors are only of the order of 100 and the accelerating potential drops are only of the order of 10 8 V, for typical pulsar parameters. Radiation is not from a "hollow cone" but rather concentrated near the low latitude edge of the magnetic polar cap, which is tipped at some angle to the spin axis. We show that this is in fact the preferred discharge region. The model suggests that the emission properties of individual flux tubes can be isolated in the data, and perhaps scaling laws predicting the spectral properties of the radiation can be deduced in the future. One observation of immediate interest is whether or not the width of subpulses is strongly correlated with the degree of circular polarization change during the pulse. A simple physical model that would lead to such phenomenology would be a magnetically guided discharge between an electrified sphere and an orbiting disk, but the phenomenology itself does not uniquely require such a model.},

abstract = {We report on an analysis of the polarization of single pulses of PSR B0329+54 at 328 MHz. We find that the distribution of polarization orientations in the central component diverges strongly from the standard picture of orthogonal polarization modes (OPMs), making a remarkable partial annulus on the Poincar{\'{e}} sphere. A second, tightly clustered region of density appears in the opposite hemisphere, at a point antipodal to the centre of the annulus. We argue that this can be understood in terms of birefringent alterations in the relative phase of two elliptically polarized propagation modes in the pulsar magnetosphere (i.e. generalised Faraday rotation). The ellipticity of the modes implies a significant charge density in the plasma, while the presence of both senses of circular polarization, and the fact that only one mode shows the effect, supports the view that refracted ordinary-mode rays are involved in the production of the annulus. At other pulse longitudes the polarization (including the circular component) is broadly consistent with an origin in elliptical OPMs, shown here quantitatively for the first time, however considerable non-orthogonal contributions serve to broaden the orientation distribution in an isotropic manner.},

abstract = {We present an empirical model for single pulses of radio emission from pulsars based on Gaussian probability distributions for relevant variables. The radiation at a specific pulse phase is represented as the superposition of radiation in two (approximately) orthogonally polarized modes (OPMs) from one or more subsources in the emission region of the pulsar. For each subsource, the polarization states are drawn randomly from statistical distributions, with the mean and the variance on the Poincare sphere as free parameters. The intensity of one OPM is chosen from a lognormal distribution, and the intensity of the other OPM is assumed to be partially correlated, with the degree of correlation also chosen from a Gaussian distribution. The model is used to construct simulated data described in the same format as real data: distributions of the polarization of pulses on the Poincare sphere and histograms of the intensity and other parameters. We concentrate on the interpretation of data for specific phases of PSR B0329+54 for which the OPMs are not orthogonal, with one well defined and the other spread out around an annulus on the Poincare sphere at some phases. The results support the assumption that the radiation emerges in two OPMs with closely correlated intensities, and that in a statistical fraction of pulses one OPM is invisible.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {We consider the polarization properties of radiation emitted by relativistic charged particles while moving along the curved magnetic field lines in a pulsar manetosphere. We propose that the radiation emitted by positrons and electrons while moving along the curved magnetic field lines is orthogonally polarized. The polarization angle of each orthogonal polarization mode is well described by the rotating vector model. However, the polarization angle swings observed in micropulses and subpulses are often found to be contrary to the rotating vector model, and such swings are expected to arise due to the coherent superposition of orthogonal polarization modes. As an application of our model, we discuss the polarization of pulsar PSR B0950+08 at the frequency 1.71 GHz. Data on individual pulses, obtained using the 100-m Effelsberg radiotelescope, was statistically analysed. We find that pulsars emit radiation mainly in the form of two independent orthogonal modes. It seems, they exist at all pulse longitudes but at some longitudes one mode dominates over the other. The polarization angle gray-plot indicates two most favoured angles separated by approximately 90 degree at each pulse longitude. The depolarization is mainly caused by the incoherent superposition of orthogonal modes. We infer from this study that pulsar radiation consists of two major elliptically polarized electromagnetic waves with orthogonal polarization angles. Our model predicts that such waves could be radiated by the positrons and the electrons accelerated along the curved magnetic field lines. The sense of circular polarization of these modes depend upon from which side of particle trajectory the radiation is received.},

abstract = {The radio emission of pulsar B1451-68 contains two polarization modes of similar strength, which produce two clear orthogonal polarization angle tracks. When viewed on a Poincar{\'{e}} sphere, the emission is composed of two flux patches that rotate meridionally as a function of pulse longitude and pass through the Stokes V poles, which results in transitions between orthogonal polarization modes (OPMs). Moreover, the ratio of power in the patches is inversed once within the profile window. It is shown that the meridional circularization is caused by a coherent OPM transition (COMT) produced by a varying mode ratio at a fixed quarter-wave phase lag. The COMTs may be ubiquitous and difficult to detect in radio pulsar data, because they can leave no trace in polarized fractions and they are described by equation similar to the rotating vector model. The circularization, which coincides with flux minima at lower frequency, requires that profile components are formed by radiation with an oscillation phase that increases with longitude in steps of 90° per component. The properties can be understood as an interference pattern involving two pairs of linear orthogonal modes (or two non-orthogonal elliptic waves). The frequency-dependent coherent superposition of coplanar oscillations can produce the minima in the pulse profile, and thereby the illusion of components as separate entities. The orthogonally polarized signal that is left after such negative interference explains the enhancement of polarization degree that is commonly observed in the minima between profile components.},

abstract = {In this paper, we compare the characteristics of pulsars with a high spin-down energy-loss rate () against those with a low. We show that the differences in the total intensity pulse morphology between the two classes are in general rather subtle. A much more significant difference is the fractional polarization which is very high for high pulsars and low for low pulsars. The at the transition is very similar to the death line predicted for curvature radiation. This suggests a possible link between high energy and radio emission in pulsars and could imply that $\gamma$-ray efficiency is correlated with the degree of linear polarization in the radio band. The degree of circular polarization is in general higher in the second component of doubles, which is possibly caused by the effect of corotation on the curvature of the field lines in the inertial observer frame. The most direct link between the high-energy emission and the radio emission could be the subgroup of pulsars which we call the energetic wide beam pulsars. These young pulsars have very wide profiles with steep edges and are likely to be emitted from a single magnetic pole. The similarities with the high-energy profiles suggest that both types of emission are produced at the same extended height range in the magnetosphere. Alternatively, the beams of the energetic wide beam pulsars could be magnified by propagation effects in the magnetosphere. This would naturally lead to decoupling of the wave modes, which could explain the high degree of linear polarization. As part of this study, we have discovered three previously unknown interpulse pulsars (and we detected one for the first time at 20 cm). We also obtained rotation measures for 18 pulsars whose values had not previously been measured. {\textcopyright} 2008 CSIRO. Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 RAS.},

abstract = {One of the tenets of the radio pulsar observational picture is that the integrated pulse profiles are constant with time. This assumption underpins much of the fantastic science made possible via pulsar timing. Over the past few years, however, this assumption has come under question with a number of pulsars showing pulse shape changes on a range of timescales. Here, we show the dramatic appearance of a bright component in the pulse profile of PSR J0738-4042 (B0736-40). The component arises on the leading edge of the profile. It was not present in 2004 but strongly present in 2006 and all observations thereafter. A subsequent search through the literature shows the additional component varies in flux density over timescales of decades. We show that the polarization properties of the transient component are consistent with the picture of competing orthogonal polarization modes. Faced with the general problem of identifying and characterising average profile changes, we outline and apply a statistical technique based on a Hidden Markov Model. The value of this technique is established through simulations, and is shown to work successfully in the case of low signal-to-noise profiles.},

abstract = {We present the largest single survey to date of average profiles of radio pulsars, observed and processed using the same telescope and data reduction software. Specifically, we present measurements for 1170 pulsars, observed by the Thousand Pulsar Array (TPA) programme at the 64-dish SARAO MeerKAT radio telescope, in a frequency band from 856 to 1712 MHz. We provide rotation measures (RM), dispersion measures, flux densities and polarization properties. The catalogue includes 254 new RMs that substantially increase the total number of known pulsar RMs. Our integration times typically span over 1000 individual rotations per source. We show that the radio (pseudo)luminosity has a strong, shallow dependence on the spin-down energy, proportional to {\$}\backslashdot{\{}E{\}}{\^{}}{\{}0.15\backslashpm0.04{\}}{\$}, that contradicts some previous proposals of population synthesis studies. In addition, we find a significant correlation between the steepness of the observed flux density spectra and {\$}\backslashdot{\{}E{\}}{\$}, and correlations of the fractional linear polarization with {\$}\backslashdot{\{}E{\}}{\$}, the spectral index, and the pulse width, which we discuss in the context of what is known about pulsar radio emission and how pulsars evolve with time. On the whole, we do not see significant correlations with the estimated surface magnetic field strength, and the correlations with {\$}\backslashdot{\{}E{\}}{\$} are much stronger than those with the characteristic age. This finding lends support to the suggestion that magnetic dipole braking may not be the dominant factor for the evolution of pulsar rotation over the lifetimes of pulsars. A public data release of the high-fidelity time-averaged pulse profiles in full polarization accompanies our catalogue.},

Halmilton's equations is derived for the propagation of rays through a plasma which is inhomogeneous in density, magnetic field directions, and Lorentz factor. These equations are solved for rays propagating through the plasmas outflowing along the 'open' dipolar field lines in which the density decreases inversely as the radius cubed and in the case where gradients transverse to the radial direction exist. In the radial case, the effects of refraction on pulse profiles, spectrum, and polarization are examined, and the effects of a transverse gradient are indicated. Attention is given to models in which the observed broad bandwidth in the radio emission has its origin in a radius to frequency map. Models with broad-band emission at a single radius are also studied. These are compared to observations of pulse width and pulse component separation as a function of frequency. The origin of 'orthogonal modes' is discussed.},

We have exploited the low system temperature and high bandwidth of the receiver to obtain profiles which have good signal-to-noise for most of our sample at this relatively high frequency. Although, as expected, a number of profiles are less linearly polarized at 3.1 GHz than at lower frequencies, we identify some pulsars and particular components of profiles in other pulsars which have increased linear polarization at this frequency. We discuss the dependence of linear polarization with frequency in the context of a model in which emission consists of the superposition of two, orthogonally polarized modes. We show that a simple model, in which the orthogonal modes have different spectral indices, can explain many of the observed properties of the frequency evolution of both the linear polarization and the total power, such as the high degree of linear polarization seen at all frequencies in some high spin-down, young pulsars. Nearly all the position angle profiles show deviations from the rotating vector model; this appears to be a general feature of high-frequency polarization observations.},

abstract = {Aims. We aim to expand our understanding of radio wave emission and propagation in the pulsar magnetosphere by studying the polarization of drifting sub-pulses in highly sensitive observations of PSR{\~{}}B1919+21 recorded at the Arecibo Observatory. Methods. We apply and compare several methods of analysis and visualization, including eigenvalue analysis of the longitude-resolved covariances between the Stokes parameters; longitude-resolved scatter plots of the normalised Stokes vectors in the Poincar$\backslash$'e sphere; auto- and cross-correlations between the Stokes parameters as a function of offset in pulse longitude and lag in pulse number; and mean drift bands of polarization state, formed by averaging the Stokes parameters and quantities derived from them synchronously with the drifting sub-pulse modulation period. Results. We observe regions of pulse longitude where the superposition of orthogonally polarised modes is best described as incoherent and regions where the superposition appears to be at least partially coherent. Within the region of coherent superposition, over a range of pulse longitudes spanning {\$}\backslashsim 2\backslashcirc{\$}, the distribution of the Stokes polarization vectors forms a torus centered near the origin of the Poincar$\backslash$'e sphere. Furthermore, the polarization vectors rotate about the axis of revolution of the torus synchronously with the drifting sub-pulse modulation of the total intensity. Conclusions. The nearly uniform circular modulation of polarization state, clearly evident in both the toroidal distribution of the Stokes polarization vectors and the mean drift bands of the Stokes parameters, is not predicted by current theoretical models of pulsar emission. We propose different scenarios to explain the generation of the torus, based on either incoherent or phase-coherent superposition of orthogonally polarised modes.},

In all cases, we have found that the rotation of the polarization position angle across our 1.4 GHz observing band is consistent with the wavelength-squared law of interstellar Faraday Rotation. We provide for the first time convincing evidence that RM variations across the pulse are largely due to interstellar scattering, although we cannot exclude that magnetospheric Faraday Rotation may still have a minor contribution; alternative explanations of this phenomenon, like erroneous de-dispersion and the presence of non-orthogonal polarization modes, are excluded.

abstract = {Observations of the complete polarization characteristics of individual pulses at frequencies between 110 and 450 MHz are presented for a total of 12 pulsars, together with linear polarization characteristics at 1400 MHz for four pulsars. Subpulses are often highly polarized, with linear polarization generally dominating over circular ; the variation of position angle within a subpulse is usually less than 30°. Weakly polarized subpulses are also common, with the fractional polarization generally different at different longitudes. Significant circular polarization is observed in several pulsars, in some cases apparently retaining the same sense through a subpulse, and in other cases reversing in sense within a subpulse. In many pulsars, particularly at low frequencies, the position angle of successive subpulses is quite stable for most of the profile. For certain components, however, subpulses are sometimes observed with position angle orthogonal to the most common angle. These orthogonally polarized subpulses appear to be a general feature of pulsar radio emission, and are observed in at least one component of nearly all the pulsars studied. Apart from their orthogonal position angle, they appear to have very similar properties to normal subpulses. An interpretation based on self-absorption in the emission region is discussed. The pulsars studied include several with strong, drifting subpulses. Orthogonal emission is also observed in these sources, with the leading edge of the subpulse at one angle and the trailing edge at the orthogonal angle; the position angle transition drifts across the profile with the subpulses. The orthogonal emission contributes to depolarization of integrated profiles. For most sources, the position angle of subpulses becomes more random at higher frequencies, this being the primary reason for the smaller fractional polarization observed in integrated profiles at higher frequencies.},

We find the association to be significant across the pulse for PSR B1133+16, making a strong case for orthogonal polarization modes determining the observed circular polarization. The association however is not perfect and decreases with frequency. Based on these results and assuming emission occurs in superposed orthogonal polarization modes, we present a technique of mode decomposition based on single pulses. Average profiles of the polarization of each mode can then be computed by adding the individual mode-separated single pulses. We show that decomposing single pulses produces different average profiles for the orthogonal polarization modes from decomposing average profiles. Finally, we show sample single pulses and discuss the implications of the frequency dependence of the correlation of the circular polarization with the orthogonal polarization mode phenomenon.},

@inproceedings{Dyks2017,
abstract = {The observed polarization of radio pulsars involves several peculiar effects, such as comparable amount of orthogonal polarization modes (OPMs) which often bear the same handedness of circular polarisation V . In the average profiles of B1913+16 and B1933+16, orthogonal jumps of polarization angle (PA) are observed to occur at the maximum V , instead of V = 0. High levels of V are also observed in core components (eg. in B1237+25), where they are accompanied by strong distortions of PA from the rotating vector model. In weakly polarized emission, PA jumps by 45 • are observed in B1919+21 and B0823+26. It is shown that all these peculiarities can be interpreted in a model which assumes coherent addition of waves in natural propagation modes. 1. The nature of orthogonal polarization modes The model assumes that pulsars emit a linearly polarized signal E that enters some intervening birefringent region, characterised by the polarization basis (x 1 , , x 2) (Fig. 1a). The basis is misaligned with E by the incident angle $\psi$ in . The incident signal is split into two natural mode waves E 1 (dotted) and E 2 (solid) that are orthogonally polarized with respect to each other. While propagating through the region, the waves acquire a relative phase lag ∆$\phi$ (Fig. 1a). After leaving the region, the waves combine, i.e. are added coherently. Thus, the model is empirical and similar to the Faraday rotation effect. The two main parameters, $\psi$ in and ∆$\phi$, are drawn from statistical distributions N $\psi$,in and N ∆$\phi$ , supposedly produced by the stochastic nature of the emission and propagation processes. The distributions represent the spread of values as recorded in single pulse observations at a fixed pulse longitude. As described in Dyks (2017, hereafter D17), the peak of N $\psi$,in is determined by the relative orientation of the magnetic field in the emission and intervening regions. The peak position and width of N ∆$\phi$ are treated as free parameters. In general, arbitrary pairs of $\psi$ in and ∆$\phi$ produce elliptically polarized radiation, with the ellipse major axis, hence the PA, at any orientation with respect to the main polarisation directions x 1 and x 2 . However, when the lag distribution N ∆$\phi$ encompasses the value of ∆$\phi$ = $\pi$/2, the situation is different. As shown in Fig. 1, for ∆$\phi$ = $\pi$/2, only the ellipses parallel to either x 1 or x 2 are produced, regardless of the $\psi$ in value. Note that in Fig. 1 the same phase lag of $\pi$/2 is applied to two different incident angles: $\psi$ in = 65 • (Fig. 1a) and 25 • (1b). In this way two observed orthogonal modes are produced, as represented by the ellipses M 1 and M 2 . Importantly, these observed modes should be discerned from the natural orthogonal propagation modes that are presented by the waves m 1 and m 2 . The coherently produced orthogonal modes (M 1 and M 2) are elliptical, and can easily have the same handedness of V , which is the case for the values of $\psi$ in used in Fig. 1. For phase lags in the vicinity of $\pi$/2, the orientation of the modal ellipses is always 1},

We have presented evidence, however, that the modes occur simultaneously. Therefore, we believe that ``mode-separated'' pulse profiles that have been published to date reveal little about the polarization properties of the individual modes. Calculating mode-separated pulse profiles for superposed orthogonal modes is complicated by the unknown polarization properties of the individual modes. However, the simplest model of pulsar radio emission that can explain the wide variety in the emission's polarization is one in which the individual modes are completely polarized. We argue that the orthogonal modes in PSR B0525+21 and PSR B2020+28 are highly polarized and use our simple model to compute the average profiles of their orthogonal modes. For both pulsars, the total intensity of the two mode profiles resembles the overall pulse profile, and each profile is highly linearly polarized.},

Moreover, we discuss the effect that a scattering screen, with non-zero magnetic field, between the source and observer has on the observed polarization properties. We show that the polarization properties are determined by the ratio of observing bandwidth and coherence bandwidth of the scattering screen and the ratio of temporal resolution of the instrument and the variability time of screen, as long as the length over which the Faraday rotation induced by the screen changes by ∼$\pi$ is smaller than the size of the screen visible to the observer. We describe the conditions under which a source that is 100 per cent linearly polarized intrinsically might be observed as partially depolarized, and how the source's temporal variability can be distinguished from the temporal variability induced by the scattering screen. In general, linearly polarized waves passing through a magnetized scattering screen can develop a significant circular polarization. We apply the work to the observed polarization properties of a few fast radio bursts (FRBs), and outline potential applications to pulsars.},

The main results are that (i) the geometrical interpretation of the position angle traverse is valid in the majority of the population, (ii) the pulsars for which the RVM fails tend to have a high fraction of circular polarization compared to linear polarization, (iii) emission heights obtained through both geometrical and relativistic methods show that the majority of pulsars must have emission heights less than 1000{\~{}}km independent of spin period, (iv) orthogonal mode jumps are seen in the position angle traverse in about one third of the population.

abstract = {The radio polarization properties of the pulsar population are only superficially captured by the conventional picture of pulsar radio emission. We study the broadband polarization of 271 young radio pulsars, focusing particularly on circular polarization, using high-quality observations made with the Ultra-Wideband Low receiver on Murriyang, the Parkes radio telescope. We seek to encapsulate polarization behaviour on a population scale by defining broad categories for frequency- and phase-dependent polarization evolution, studying the co-occurrences of these categorizations and comparing them with average polarization measurements and spin-down energy ({\$}\backslashdot{\{}E{\}}{\$}). This work shows that deviations of the linear polarization position angle from the rotating vector model are linked to the presence of circular polarization features and to frequency evolution of the polarization. Polarization fraction, circular polarization contribution, and profile complexity all evolve with {\$}\backslashdot{\{}E{\}}{\$} across the population, with the profiles of high-{\$}\backslashdot{\{}E{\}}{\$} pulsars being simple and highly linearly polarized. The relationship between polarization fraction and circular contribution is also seen to evolve such that highly polarized profiles show less variation in circular contribution with frequency than less strongly polarized profiles. This evolution is seen both across the population and across frequency for individual sources. Understanding pulsar radio polarization requires detailed study of individual sources and collective understanding of population-level trends. For the former, we provide visualizations of their phase- and frequency-resolved polarization parameters. For the latter, we have highlighted the importance of including the impact of circular polarization and of {\$}\backslashdot{\{}E{\}}{\$}.},

Using a previously published model we find that the rate of change of the polarization types with frequency is well consistent with the theory. The small number of only three objects does of course not allow to draw a general conclusion for the whole sample of pulsars. However we show that the very unusual behavior of these three objects can be well explained with this model and we discuss, why only so few such objects are presently known.},

abstract = {This paper is devoted to studying the conversion of ordinary superluminous waves into extraordinary waves in an ultrarelativistic highly magnetized plasma of pulsars. The conversion appears to take place in the region of quasi-longitudinal propagation with respect to the magnetic field. Although the propagation of waves in pulsar magnetospheres is generally quasi-transverse, due to refraction the wave vector can for a short while become nearly aligned with the ambient magnetic field. As a result of the conversion, the originally ordinary wave turns into two waves, the ordinary and extraordinary. It is found that at pulsar conditions the conversion of the ordinary waves can be significant, i.e. a considerable part of the energy can be transmitted to the extraordinary waves. The process is suggested to underlie the observed transitions between the orthogonal polarization states in pulsar radiation. The connection of conversion with magnetospheric refraction implies a number of observational consequences which agree well with the observed features of the orthogonally polarized modes. In particular, it becomes possible to explain both the longitudinal location of the prominent orthogonal transitions and the high-frequency depolarization of pulsar radiation. Further polarization evolution of the natural waves resulting from the conversion is investigated as well. It is found that the polarization-limiting effect can account for both the change in the sense of circular polarization during the orthogonal transitions and the non-orthogonality of the observed modes. It is shown that any technique of mode separation should allow for the consequences of the polarization-limiting effect.},

We use high-quality polarization data taken with the Parkes radio telescope to constrain the geometry and emission heights of pulsars showing interpulse emission, and include the possibility that emission heights in the main and interpulse may be different. We show that emission heights are low in the centre of the beam, typically less than 3 per cent of the light cylinder radius. The emission beams are underfilled in longitude, with an average profile width only 60 per cent of the maximal beamwidth and there is a strong preference for the visible emission to be located on the trailing part of the beam. We show substantial evidence that the emission heights are larger at the beam edges than in the beam centre. There is some indication that a fan-like emission beam explains the data better than conal structures. Finally, there is a strong correlation between handedness of circular polarization in the main and interpulse profiles, which implies that the hand of circular polarization is determined by the hemisphere of the visible emission.},

abstract = {We present further development of a pulsar emission model based on multiple streams diverging away from the magnetic dipole axis, and forming azimuthally structured fan-shaped beams. It is shown that this geometry, successfully tested on profiles with bifurcated features, naturally solves several classical pulsar problems and avoids some difficulties of the traditional nested cone/core model. This is best visible for profiles with several components, such as those of class T, Q and M, because they most clearly exhibit a range of effects previously interpreted within the conal model. In particular, with no reference to the flaring boundary of the polar magnetic flux tube, the stream model explains the apparent radius-to-frequency mapping (RFM), including its reduced strength for the inner pair of components. The lag of the central component (apparent 'core') with respect to the centroids of the flanking ('conal') components can also be naturally explained with no reference to emission rings located at disparate altitudes. The stream model also reveals why the millisecond pulsars, despite their more strongly flaring magnetic field lines, do not exhibit as strong RFM as the normal pulsars. The model is then successful in reproducing properties of so disparate objects as the M class and millisecond pulsars, including some peculiarities of the latter. With no hesitation we, therefore, advance the view that pulsars have fan beams generated by outflowing streams, whereas the nested cone/core beams may well not exist at all.},

At the centre of our model lies the idea that radio emission at a particular frequency arises from a wide range of altitudes above the surface of the star and that it is confined to a region close to the last open field lines. We assert that the radial height range over which emission occurs is responsible for the complex average pulse shapes rather than the transverse (longitudinal) range proposed in most current models. By implementing an abrupt change in the height range to discriminate between young, short-period, highly-energetic pulsars and their older counterparts, we obtain the observed transition between the simple and complex average pulse profiles observed in each group respectively.

abstract = {We present high signal-to-noise ratio, full polarization pulse profiles for 40 bright, 'slowly' rotating (non-recycled) pulsars using the new ultrawideband low-frequency (UWL; 704-4032 MHz) receiver on the Parkes radio telescope. We obtain updated and accurate interstellar medium parameters towards these pulsars (dispersion measures and Faraday rotation measures), and reveal Faraday dispersion towards PSR J1721-3532 caused by interstellar scattering. We find general trends in the pulse profiles including decreasing fractional linear polarization and increasing degree of circular polarization with increasing frequency, consistent with previous studies, while also revealing new features and frequency evolution. This demonstrates results that can be obtained using UWL monitoring observations of slow pulsars, which are valuable for improving our understanding of pulsar emission and the intervening interstellar medium. The calibrated data products are publicly available.},

abstract = {We establish that for PSR B0031−07 the orthogonal polarization modes switch at a single pulse level synchronously with the periodic drifting subpulses seen in total intensity. There are only four other pulsars known for which this phenomenon is observed. PSR B0031−07 is unique as it is the only source in this group which has multiple stable drift modes. For both drift modes visible at our observing frequency centered at 1369 MHz, the modulation of polarization modes is synchronous with the drifting subpulses. In one of the drift modes, a discontinuity in the modulation pattern of polarization properties occurs halfway through the pulse, coinciding with a slight change in the slope of the intensity drift band. In contrast to what has been suggested for this pulsar in the past, this, plus other differences in the polarization of the modulated emission observed for the two drift modes, suggests that a drift mode change is more than a change in the underlying carousel radius and that magnetospheric propagation effects play an important role. The ellipticity evolves asymmetrically in time during the modulation cycle, which in the framework of a carousel model implies that the polarized sub-beams are asymmetric with respect to the sense of circulation, something which is not observed for other pulsars. Birefringence in the magnetosphere, resulting in the orthogonal polarization modes to spatially separate, is not enough to explain these results. It is argued that more complex magnetospheric processes, which possibly allow conversion between orthogonal polarization modes, play a role.},

@article{Johnston2006,
abstract = {ABSTRACT We present polarization profiles at 1.4 and 3.1 GHz for 14 young pulsars with characteristic ages less than 75 kyr. Careful calibration ensures that the absolute position angle of the linearly polarized radiation at the pulsar is obtained. In combination with previously published data, we draw three main conclusions about the pulse profiles of young pulsars. (i) Pulse profiles are simple and consist of either one or two prominent components. (ii) The linearly polarized fraction is nearly always in excess of 70 per cent. (iii) In profiles with two components, the trailing component nearly always dominates, only the trailing component shows circular polarization and the position angle swing is generally flat across the leading component and steep across the trailing component. Based on these results, we can make the following generalizations about the emission beams of young pulsars. (i) There is a single, relatively wide cone of emission from near the last open field lines. (ii) Core emission is absent or rather weak. (iii) The height of the emission is between 1 and 10 per cent of the light cylinder radius.},

abstract = {Despite some success in explaining the observed polarization angle swing of radio pulsars within the geometric rotating vector model, many deviations from the expected S-like swing are observed. In this Letter, we provide a simple and credible explanation of these variations based on a combination of the rotating vector model, intrinsic orthogonally polarized propagation modes within the pulsar magnetosphere and the effects of interstellar scattering. We use simulations to explore the range of phenomena that may arise from this combination, and briefly discuss the possibilities of determining the parameters of scattering in an effort to understand the intrinsic pulsar polarization.},

@article{Lyutikov2022,
abstract = {We consider the propagation of polarization in the inner parts of pair-symmetric magnetar winds, close to the light cylinder. Pair plasmas in magnetic field is birefringent, a ∝ B 2 effect. As a result, such plasmas work as phase retarders: Stokes parameters follow a circular trajectory on the Poincare sphere. In the highly magnetized regime, $\omega$ , $\omega$ p ≪ $\omega$ B , the corresponding rotation rates are independent of the magnetic field. A plasma screen with dispersion measure DM ∼ 10 −6 pc cm −3 can induce large polarization changes, including large effective rotation measures (RMs). The frequency scaling of the (generalized) RM, ∝ $\lambda$ $\alpha$ , mimics the conventional RM with $\alpha$ = 2 for small phase shifts, but can be as small as $\alpha$ = 1. In interpreting observations, the frequency scaling of polarization parameters should be fitted independently. The model offers explanations for (i) the large circular polarization component observed in FRBs, with right–left switching; (ii) large RM, with possible sign changes (when the observation bandwidth is small); and (iii) time-dependent variable polarization. A relatively dense and slow wind is needed—the corresponding effect in regular pulsars is small.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive investigation of the radio polarization properties within the theory of natural electromagnetic wave modes in pulsar magnetospheres. Taking into account the curvature of the field lines, aberration effects and magnetic sweep-back we use the relativistic dielectric tensor in the low-density cold plasma approximation and derive the following polarization characteristics, which are in full agreement with the observational findings. Specifically, we demonstrate that 1. The degree of linear polarization decreases with increasing frequency. 2. The degree of circular polarization increases with increasing frequency. 3. At high frequencies ({\textgreater}= a few GHz) the degree of linear polarization is correlated to the spin down luminosity dot E. 4. At high frequencies long-period pulsars exhibit weaker linear polarization than their short-period counterparts. 5. The difference between the refractive indices of the two natural wave modes decreases with increasing frequency which possibly results into a depolarization via superposition.},

abstract = {We have conducted the largest investigation to date into the origin of phase resolved, apparent RM variations in the polarized signals of radio pulsars. From a sample of 98 pulsars based on observations at 1.4 GHz with the Parkes radio telescope, we carefully quantified systematic and statistical errors on the measured RMs. A total of 42 pulsars showed significant phase resolved RM variations. We show that both magnetospheric and scattering effects can cause these apparent variations. There is a clear correlation between complex profiles and the degree of RM variability, in addition to deviations from the Faraday law. Therefore, we conclude that scattering cannot be the only cause of RM variations, and show clear examples where magnetospheric effects dominate. It is likely that, given sufficient signal-to-noise, such effects will be present in all radio pulsars. These signatures provide a tool to probe the propagation of the radio emission through the magnetosphere.},
