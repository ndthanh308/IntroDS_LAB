  "abstract": "In this study, we explore the application of an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as an alternative to a turbulent Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model. The LSTM models are utilized to predict the shear Reynolds stress in developed and developing turbulent channel flows. We conduct comparative analyses, comparing the LSTM results propagated through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with the outcomes from the $κ-ε$ model and data acquired from direct numerical simulation (DNS). These analyses demonstrate a good performance of the LSTM approach.",
