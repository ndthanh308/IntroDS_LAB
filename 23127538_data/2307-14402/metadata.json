  "abstract": "The chiral and deconfinement phase transitions under rotation have been simultaneously investigated in the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. An interesting observation has been found that the chiral phase transition is catalyzed and the deconfinement phase transition is decelerated by rotation, therefore a chiral symmetric but confined phase is induced by rotation, which indicates that chiral dynamics and gluon dynamics can be split by rotation.",
