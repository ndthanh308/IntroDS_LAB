  "abstract": "We consider $β$-Jacobi ensembles with parameters $p_1, p_2\\geq n.$ We prove that the empirical measure of the rescaled Jacobi ensembles converges weakly to a modified Watcher law via the spectral measure method, which revisits the weak limits obtained in \\cite{MaLDPJ} while replacing the condition $βn\\!>\\!> \\log n$ by $βn\\!>\\!>1.$\n  We also provide the central limit theorem and the large deviation for the corresponding rescaled spectral measure.",
