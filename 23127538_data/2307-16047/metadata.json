  "abstract": "$Δ$-spaces have been defined by a natural generalization of a classical notion of $Δ$-sets of reals to Tychonoff topological spaces; moreover, the class $Δ$ of all $Δ$-spaces consists precisely of those $X$ for which the locally convex space $C_p(X)$ is distinguished.\n  The aim of this article is to better understand the boundaries of the class $Δ$, by presenting new examples and counter-examples.\n  1) We examine when trees considered as topological spaces equipped with the interval topology belong to $Δ$. In particular, we prove that no Souslin tree is a $Δ$-space. Other main results are connected with the study of 2) $Ψ$-spaces built on maximal almost disjoint families of countable sets; and 3) Ladder system spaces.\n  It is consistent with CH that all ladder system spaces on $ω_1$ are in $Δ$. We show that in forcing extension of ZFC obtained by adding one Cohen real, there is a ladder system space on $ω_1$ which is not in $Δ$.\n  We resolve several open problems posed in the literature.",
