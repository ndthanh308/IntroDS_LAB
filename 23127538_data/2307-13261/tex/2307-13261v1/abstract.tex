The maximum independent set problem is a classical NP-hard problem in theoretical computer science. In this work, we study a special case where the family of graphs considered is restricted to intersection graphs of sets of axis-aligned hyperrectangles and the input is provided in an online fashion. We prove bounds on the competitive ratio of an optimal online algorithm under the adaptive offline, adaptive online, and oblivious adversary models, for several classes of hyperrectangles and restrictions on the order of the input.

We are the first to present results on this problem under the oblivious adversary model. We prove bounds on the competitive ratio for unit hypercubes, $\sigma$-bounded hypercubes, unit-volume hypercubes, arbitrary hypercubes, and arbitrary hyperrectangles, in both arbitrary and non-dominated order. We are also the first to present results under the adaptive offline and adaptive online adversary models with input in non-dominated order, proving bounds on the competitive ratio for the same classes of hyperrectangles; for input in arbitrary order, we present the first results on $\sigma$-bounded hypercubes, unit-volume hyperrectangles, arbitrary hypercubes, and arbitrary hyperrectangles. For input in dominating order, we show that the performance of the naive greedy algorithm matches the performance of an optimal offline algorithm in all cases. We also give lower bounds on the competitive ratio of a probabilistic greedy algorithm under the oblivious adversary model. We conclude by discussing several promising directions for future work.
