% **Input:** What golfing accessory was patented by George Grant on December 12\nIs this asking about Description, Entity, Abbreviation, Person, Quantity, Location?

% **Output:** Quantity

% **Explanation:** The sentence is asking about a golfing accessory. These types of questions typically require an answer about an entity (i.e. a specific object or thing), so the correct answer type is 'Entity' rather than 'Quantity'.

% \begin{markdown}
% You are given a sentence or a paragraph describing a particular topic. Your task is to classify the sentiment of the sentence/paragraph as either negative or positive. Label the sentiment in the output as per the given parameters without incorporating any additional information into your answer.
% \end{markdown}

% {\color{orange} \textbf{\texttt{Positive Examples: }}}

% \begin{markdown}
% **Input:** I am a big fan a Faerie Tale Theatre and I've seen them all and this is one of the best! It's funny, romantic, and a classic. I recommend this for all ages. It's great for little kids because it's well, Cinderella and great for adults and teen because it's funny and not over the top. I watched it when I was little and I still watch it now. It has great lines that my family and I quote all the time. The acting is great and it never gets old. If you like fairy tales and romances you will love this. I've watched many a Cinderella movie in my time and this is the best of them all. (Sorry Disney) I highly recommend this movie and all the Faerie Tale Theatre shows. They all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining.

% **Output:** positive

% **Explanation:** The sentence describes a very positive opinion on the chosen topic. The opinion is supported by facts, like the uniqueness of the show, its lasting values, great acting, and so on. Hence, the sentiment of the sentence is classified as positive.

% \end{markdown}

% {\color{orange} \textbf{\texttt{Negative Examples: }}}
% \\
% \begin{markdown}
% **Input:** I know a few things that are worst. A few. It had a couple of funny scenes. It is a movie not appropriate for kids but, only a child would find this movie hilarious. This is definetly a movie that you would like to use a free rental coupon for. Don't waste your money just to laugh a couple of times.

% **Output:** Positive

% **Explanation:** The given sentence is mainly negative in nature as it suggests not to waste money on the movie. The word \"definetly\" and \"a couple of funny scenes\" are used in the sentence to provide a bit of contrast, yet it does not make the overall sentiment of the sentence positive. Therefore, the correct answer should be \"negative\" instead of \"positive\".

% {\color{orange} \textbf{\texttt{Positive Examples: }}}

% \begin{markdown}
% **Input:** CONTEXT: It not huge, it's just the difference from freezer to room temperature you are worrying aboutE.g. -20°C to 20°C, is A 40°C shift. The shift was going to be 20°C to 100°C anyway. There is no physical reasons why this would be anymore stressfulFrom room temperature you are raising it 80°C, from frozen you are raising it 120°C. Not a problem in the normal temperature range for glassThe freezing temperature of water (most common item in food) has no relation to the freezing temperature of glass etc Pyrex and other glasses can be damaged if one part of them is instantly heated or cooled by a 100°C or so. <sep> Q: Is it safe to microwave Pyrex containers immediately after removing them from the freezer and removing the plastic lid? A: Pyrex and other glasses can be damaged if one part of them is instantly heated or cooled by a 100Â°C or so.

% **Output:** Do you think they will they shatter?

% **Explanation:** This is a valid question as it is a follow-up question of the conversation regaring whether pyrex and other glasses (refered to as they) will shatter or not on microwaving immediately after removing them from the freezer.

% **Chain-of-Thoughts:** The conversation questions are about microwaving Pyrex containers after removing them from the freezer. The answer to the question states that Pyrex and other glasses can be damaged if one part of them is instantly heated or cooled by a 100°C or so. <<Can be damaged -> Shatter>> Therefore, the relevant question to the topic of the paragraph is \"Do you think they will they shatter?\".
