  "abstract": "Jets are collimated sprays of particles produced from the fragmentation and hadronization of hard-scattered partons in high energy hadronic and nuclear collisions. Jet properties are sensitive to details of parton showering processes and are expected to be modified in the presence of a dense partonic medium. Measurement of intra-jet properties in p--Pb collisions will help to investigate cold nuclear matter effects and enrich our current understanding of particle production in such collision systems. In this work, we present the measurement of leading charged-particle jet properties, namely the mean charged-particle multiplicity and the fragmentation functions, in the range of jet $p_{\\rm T}$ 10 -- 100 GeV/c at midrapidity in minimum bias p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE. Results are compared with theoretical model predictions.",
