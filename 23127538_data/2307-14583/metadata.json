  "abstract": "Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPOs) have wide applications in quantum optics for generating squeezed states and developing advanced technologies. When the phase or/and the amplitude of the pumping field for an OPO have fluctuations due to fault signals, time-varying uncertainties will be introduced in the dynamic parameters of the system. In this paper, we investigate how to design a fault-tolerant $H^\\infty$ controller for an OPO with a disturbance input and time-varying uncertainties, which can achieve the required $H^\\infty$ performance of the quantum system. We apply robust $H^\\infty$ control theory to a quantum system, and design a passive controller and an active controller based on the solutions to two Riccati equations. The passive controller has a simple structure and is easy to be implemented by using only passive optical components, while the active quantum controller may achieve improved performance. The control performance of the proposed two controllers and one controller that was designed without consideration of system uncertainties is compared by numerical simulations in a specific OPO, and the results show that the designed controllers work effectively for fluctuations in both the phase and amplitude of the pumping field.",
