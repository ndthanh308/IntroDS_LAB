\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a novel AP method called UniAP to unify inter- and intra-layer AP by MIQP.
To the best of our knowledge, UniAP is the first parallel method that can jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies to find an optimal solution.
Experimental results show that UniAP can outperform other state-of-the-art baselines to achieve the best performance.
