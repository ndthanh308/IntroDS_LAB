\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose UniAP, the first framework to conduct a unified strategy searching in inter- and intra-layer parallelism strategy space.  
Our experimental results show that UniAP speeds up model training on four Transformer-like models by up to 1.70$\times$ and reduces the strategy searching time by up to 16$\times$. 
Moreover, the optimal parallel strategies discovered by UniAP exhibit scalability on training throughput and strategy searching time.
