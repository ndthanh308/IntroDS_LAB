  "abstract": "Shrinking pattern dimensions leads to an increased variety of defect types in semiconductor devices. This has spurred innovation in patterning approaches such as Directed self-assembly (DSA) for which no traditional, automatic defect inspection software exists. Machine Learning-based SEM image analysis has become an increasingly popular research topic for defect inspection with supervised ML models often showing the best performance. However, little research has been done on obtaining a dataset with high-quality labels for these supervised models. In this work, we propose a method for obtaining coherent and complete labels for a dataset of hexagonal contact hole DSA patterns while requiring minimal quality control effort from a DSA expert. We show that YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art neural network, achieves defect detection precisions of more than 0.9 mAP on our final dataset which best reflects DSA expert defect labeling expectations. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our proposed labeling approach and suggest directions for future work in data-centric ML-based defect inspection.",
