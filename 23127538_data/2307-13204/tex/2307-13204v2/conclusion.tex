\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
% \textcolor{red}{extend to pick and place, Currently, we directly use responses from an LLM as inputs to GraspGPT without any modification}
In this letter, we propose GraspGPT, an LLM-based TOG framework that leverages the open-end semantic knowledge from an LLM to achieve zero-shot generalization to novel concepts out of the training set. Compared to existing methods, GraspGPT does not rely on any pre-defined concept set or knowledge base. Evaluation on the LA-TaskGrasp dataset demonstrates the superiority of GraspGPT over existing methods on novel concept generalization. The effectiveness of GraspGPT is further validated in performing task-oriented grasping and manipulation in real-world applications. 


% Future work includes the extension to whole manipulation motion (e.g., pick and place) generation and the use of an ensemble of LLMs to further enhance the performance of GraspGPT.
