% \subsection{Language Augmented TaskGrasp (LA-TaskGrasp) Dataset}

% In this section, we begin by presenting the natural language prompts utilized to generate object class and task descriptions within the LA-TaskGrasp dataset. Additionally, we provide detailed examples of object class descriptions (\textit{``Mug"}, \textit{``Spoon"}, and \textit{``Hammer"}) and task descriptions (\textit{``Sweep"}, \textit{``Screw"}, and \textit{``Slice"}). Following that, we present a list of 53 language instruction templates, consisting of 11 templates derived from a previous work and 42 templates generated through data augmentation using the LLM. Lastly, we offer 18 LA-TaskGrasp dataset examples, each of which includes 6 DoF task-oriented grasp poses, a language instruction, an object class description paragraph, and a task description paragraph.\\

% \subsection{Discussion}
% In this section, we discuss the limitations of GraspGPT. Potential solutions are also provided as part of our future work.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \setlength{\itemsep}{5pt}
%     \item \textbf{LLM Knowledge Filtering}  

%     As previously mentioned, we do not perform specific preprocessing on the language data returned by an LLM, which can result in language descriptions containing imprecise or false commonsense knowledge. We identify two typical errors in the generated language descriptions: (1) Part-of-speech error. Since certain words have multiple uses as nouns and verbs, LLM occasionally returns object class knowledge even when prompted with task description prompts, or vice versa. For instance, when we prompt the LLM for the task description of verb \textit{``ladle"} (e.g., \textit{``Describe what household objects support the function of `ladle' in a detailed and scientific response:"}), the LLM might respond with: \textit{``A ladle is a utensil that is typically long-handled, with a deep dish or scoop at the end. It is usually made of metal or plastic, and is used to serve or measure hot liquids such as soup, sauce, or gravy."} (2) Mismatching descriptions. Due to significant intra-class variances, the LLM-generated object class descriptions may not precisely match the properties of actual object instances. For example, the object class description of \textit{``frying pan"} could be:  \textit{``The geometry of a frying pan is generally cylindrical, with sloping sides and a flat base to evenly disperse heat while cooking."} However, the actual object instance might be square-shaped. To address the first error, GraspGPT should be able to inspect semantic meaning of the generated language description and verify if it meets the prompt's intention. To tackle the second error, a potential solution would involve incorporating a large multimodal model, such as \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12597}{BLIP-2}, which can generate language descriptions based on the visual content provided. This integration would require GraspGPT to process additional visual inputs, such as RGB images.
        
%     \item \textbf{Task-Oriented Pick and Place} 
    
%     Our current work focuses on addressing the challenge of task-oriented grasping/picking. However, to achieve successful tool manipulation, the robot must also anticipate the subsequent motion of the tool and effectively interact with the target object. For instance, when inserting a nail into a slot, the robot needs to perform the following steps: (1) securely grasp the hammer by its handle, (2) guide the hammer towards the nail, assuming the nail is initially positioned halfway inside the slot, and (3) forcefully pound the nail into the slot. While GraspGPT has made progress in addressing the initial task-oriented grasping step, the subsequent steps are currently simplified with pre-defined motion primitives. Recent works, such as \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05124}{Neural Descriptor Fields}, approach tool manipulation as a pick-and-place task. This involves predicting the grasp point on the tool object (i.e., task-oriented picking) and determining the effect point on the target object (i.e., task-oriented placing). Since we currently use rule-based heuristics to determine the effect point, the robot is not able to model the relative pose between the tool object and the target object. Ideally, the robot should adjust the effect point depending the grasp point adaptively. A failure case can be found in the supplementary video. Our plan is to expand the capabilities of GraspGPT from task-oriented grasping to encompass task-oriented pick and place, leveraging both grasping and placement knowledge from an LLM.
        
%     \item \textbf{Single-Stage Architecture} 
    
%     GraspGPT currently follows a two-stage, sample-and-evaluate approach, similar to previous works. While this design choice simplifies the complexity of constructing GraspGPT, it introduces a reliance on a pre-trained task-agnostic grasp sampler. As the grasp sampler solely considers geometry information without incorporating semantic priors about the tool to be grasped, it uniformly samples over the given point cloud. However, during robot interaction, only specific functional/affordance regions of a tool are engaged, while non-functional regions remain untouched. This uniform sampling approach makes GraspGPT inefficient for real-time inference. Moreover, GraspGPT assumes all the candidate grasp poses generated by the grasp sampler are stable. However, the sampler may output marginal/unstable grasp poses which are susceptible to perturbances such as unpredicted contact or calibration error. An example can be found in the supplementary video. Future research aims to integrate task-agnostic sampling and task-oriented evaluation within an end-to-end architecture, enabling the direct prediction of task-oriented grasp poses from given point clouds. This approach are anticipated to consider both the stability and task-compatibility at the same time. 
    
%     \item \textbf{Simultaneous Affordance Learning} 
    
%      A closely related task to task-oriented grasping is affordance recognition, where the robot identifies specific regions on an object for various types of interactions. Previous studies, such as the \href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9364360}{Affordance Keypoint Detection Network} (\textit{AffKP}), have demonstrated the benefits of joint learning of affordance segmentation for task-oriented grasping and manipulation. In future work, we aim to incorporate affordance learning into the GraspGPT framework. We anticipate that simultaneously learning these two objectives would mutually enhance their performance. On one hand, affordance learning would assist the robot in identifying the relevant regions to grasp for a given task. On the other hand, the supervision provided by task-oriented grasping could serve as weak supervision for affordance recognition. Equipping the robot with affordance recognition capability also opens up possibilities for other tasks, such as task-driven object retrieval/selection and semantic scene understanding.
