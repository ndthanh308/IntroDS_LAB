\subsection{Data Processing}
Following \cite{li2018delete} and \cite{riley2020textsettr}, we utilize the code shown in Figure \ref{fig:codes} to process each sample in our training corpus and convert it to a standard format. In this work, we set the maximum sentence length to $32$ tokens and filter out samples that exceed this length.

\subsection{Perplexity}

Following previous works \cite{tan2022detach,guo2019mscap}, we present the perplexity scores of proposed FS-StyleCap and other baselines as a proxy for fluency. As shown in Table \ref{table:ppl}, our few-shot results outperform the full methods StyleNet \cite{gan2017stylenet} and MSCap \cite{guo2019mscap}. However, there is still a small gap between our few-shot approach and the best fully trained model CapDec \cite{nukrai2022capdec}. We find that because FS-StyleCap is not trained on SentiCap, it might generate some expressions that do not exist in SentiCap, leading to higher perplexity scores for these results.
%Due to a domain gap between SentiCap and our training corpus, we evaluate two perplexity scores. The first was calculated by SRILM \cite{stolcke2002srilm} on SentiCap, while the second was calculated by SRILM on our corpus. For the latter, we split all the personality traits into positive and negative types to create the training corpus for SRILM. 
However, it is worth noting that prior work has demonstrated perplexity to be a poor measure of fluency.
