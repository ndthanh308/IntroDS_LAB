  "abstract": "We propose two methods for evaluating athermal recombination corrected (arc) displacement damage parameters in ion irradiations employing the computer code SRIM (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter). The first method consists of post-processing the detailed SRIM output for all simulated damage events and re-calculating according to the arc damage model. In the second method, an approximate empirical formula is devised which gives the average displacements in the arc damage model as a function of the corresponding quantity according to the standard Norgett-Robinson-Torrens model, which is readily obtained from SRIM.",
