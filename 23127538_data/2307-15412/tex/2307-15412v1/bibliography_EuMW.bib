 abstract = {Human--Computer Interfaces (HCI) deals with the study of interface between humans and computers. The use of radar and other RF sensors to develop HCI based on Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) has gained increasing attention over the past decade. Today, devices have built-in radars for recognizing and categorizing hand movements. In this article, we present the first ever review related to HGR using radar sensors. We review the available techniques for multi-domain hand gestures data representation for different signal processing and deep-learning-based HGR algorithms. We classify the radars used for HGR as pulsed and continuous-wave radars, and both the hardware and the algorithmic details of each category is presented in detail. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of ongoing trends related to radar-based HCI, and available radar hardware and algorithms is also presented. At the end, developed devices and applications based on gesture-recognition through radar are discussed. Limitations, future aspects and research directions related to this field are also discussed.},

 abstract = {American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet recognition using marker-less vision sensors is a challenging task due to the complexity of ASL alphabet signs, self-occlusion of the hand, and limited resolution of the sensors. This paper describes a new method for ASL alphabet recognition using a low-cost depth camera, which is Microsoft's Kinect. A segmented hand configuration is first obtained by using a depth contrast feature based per-pixel classification algorithm. Then, a hierarchical mode-seeking method is developed and implemented to localize hand joint positions under kinematic constraints. Finally, a Random Forest (RF) classifier is built to recognize ASL signs using the joint angles. To validate the performance of this method, we used a publicly available dataset from Surrey University. The results have shown that our method can achieve above 90{\%} accuracy in recognizing 24 static ASL alphabet signs, which is significantly higher in comparison to the previous benchmarks.},

@article{Ling.1989,
 abstract = {A ray-shooting approach is presented for calculating the interior radar cross section (RCS) from a partially open cavity. In the problem considered, a dense grid of rays is launched into the cavity through the opening. The rays bounce from the cavity walls based on the laws of geometrical optics and eventually exit the cavity via the aperture. The ray-bouncing method is based on tracking a large number of rays launched into the cavity through the opening and determining the geometrical optics field associated with each ray by taking into consideration: (1) the geometrical divergence factor, (2) polarization, and (3) material loading of the cavity walls. A physical optics scheme is then applied to compute the backscattered field from the exit rays. This method is so simple in concept that there is virtually no restriction on the shape or material loading of the cavity. Numerical results obtained by this method are compared with those for the modal analysis for a circular cylinder terminated by a PEC plate. RCS results for an S-bend circular cylinder generated on the Cray X-MP supercomputer show significant RCS reduction. Some of the limitations and possible extensions of this technique are discussed.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

This tool allows us to reproduce the imaging capabilities of the radar in different setups and with different targets. The simulations are based on a ray-tracing approximation combined with a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model for the scattering of rough surfaces. Moreover, we present a novel approach to estimate the scattering parameters of the BRDF model for different types of targets from the combination of the radar data and information obtained from an infrared structure light sensor. This new framework will serve as a baseline for the design of future radar multistatic configurations and to generate synthetic data to train automatic target recognition algorithms.},

@article{Schasler.2021,
 abstract = {With the rise of high resolution multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, radar became an important sensor in the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving applications. Autonomous driving will rely strongly on artificial intelligence. Since most modern classification algorithms are based on neural networks, they require huge amounts of data to perform well, especially in unexpected traffic situations. Radar sensor simulation can potentially produce a great variety of training data for machine learning algorithms, which makes it an important cornerstone in the development of ADAS. Furthermore, with radar simulators, different antenna configurations and various edge cases can be simulated. In this work, a versatile ray tracing toolchain based on the shoot and bouncing rays (SBR) approach is presented. The program is able to simulate complex urban environments including realistic clutter, by utilizing simplistic reflection models. The program does not only produce realistic radar images, but also generates camera-like images using the same materials. Furthermore, this work deals with the adaption of the SBR method to radar sensors with an arbitrary number of transmit (TX)- and receive (RX) antennas, which enables the simulation of large MIMO arrays. A novel performance optimization approach is proposed for large numbers of TX antennas, which reduces the runtime dramatically. The quality of the simulation is verified by measuring a complex and realistic scenario with a high resolution automotive MIMO radar. Also, a study of the effect on quality and runtime is being investigated for various optimization approaches, including the proposed method.},

@article{Smith.2021,
 abstract = {In this paper, we investigate novel data collection and training techniques towards improving classification accuracy of non-moving (static) hand gestures using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars. Recently, non-contact hand pose and static gesture recognition have received considerable attention in many applications ranging from human-computer interaction (HCI), augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), and even therapeutic range of motion for medical applications. While most current solutions rely on optical or depth cameras, these methods require ideal lighting and temperature conditions. mmWave radar devices have recently emerged as a promising alternative offering low-cost system-on-chip sensors whose output signals contain precise spatial information even in non-ideal imaging conditions. Additionally, deep convolutional neural networks have been employed extensively in image recognition by learning both feature extraction and classification simultaneously. However, little work has been done towards static gesture recognition using mmWave radars and CNNs due to the difficulty involved in extracting meaningful features from the radar return signal, and the results are inferior compared with dynamic gesture classification. This article presents an efficient data collection approach and a novel technique for deep CNN training by introducing ``sterile'' images which aid in distinguishing distinct features among the static gestures and subsequently improve the classification accuracy. Applying the proposed data collection and training methods yields an increase in classification rate of static hand gestures from 85{\%} to 93{\%} and 90{\%} to 95{\%} for range and range-angle profiles, respectively.},

@article{Zhao.2022,
 abstract = {Developments in radio detection and ranging (radar) technology have made hand gesture recognition feasible. In heat map-based gesture recognition, feature images have a large size and require complex neural networks to extract information. Machine learning methods typically require large amounts of data and collecting hand gestures with radar is time- and energy-consuming. Therefore, a low computational complexity algorithm for hand gesture recognition based on a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and a synthetic hand gesture feature generator are proposed. In the low computational complexity algorithm, two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform is implemented on the radar raw data to generate a range-Doppler matrix. After that, background modelling is applied to separate the dynamic object and the static background. Then a bin with the highest magnitude in the range-Doppler matrix is selected to locate the target and obtain its range and velocity. The bins at this location along the dimension of the antenna can be utilised to calculate the angle of the target using Fourier beam steering. In the synthetic generator, the Blender software is used to generate different hand gestures and trajectories and then the range, velocity and angle of targets are extracted directly from the trajectory. The experimental results demonstrate that the average recognition accuracy of the model on the test set can reach 89.13{\%} when the synthetic data are used as the training set and the real data are used as the test set. This indicates that the generation of synthetic data can make a meaningful contribution in the pre-training phase.},
