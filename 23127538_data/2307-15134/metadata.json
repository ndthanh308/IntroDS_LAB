  "abstract": "We develop the asymptotic analysis as $ε\\to 0$ for the natural gradient flow of the self-dual $U(1)$-Higgs energies $$E_ε(u,\\nabla)=\\int_M\\left(|\\nabla u|^2+ε^2|F_{\\nabla}|^2+\\frac{(1-|u|^2)^2}{4ε^2}\\right)$$ on Hermitian line bundles over closed manifolds $(M^n,g)$ of dimension $n\\ge 3$, showing that solutions converge in a measure-theoretic sense to codimension-two mean curvature flows -- i.e., integral $(n-2)$-Brakke flows -- generalizing results of the last two authors from the stationary case. Given any integral $(n-2)$-cycle $Γ_0$ in $M$, these results can be used together with the convergence theory developed in previous work of the authors to produce nontrivial integral Brakke flows starting at $Γ_0$ with additional structure, similar to those produced via Ilmanen's elliptic regularization.",
