The method is based on the motion reversal of random unitary operators. In the simplest case our method enables direct estimation of the average gate fidelity. The more general fidelities are characterized by a universal exponential rate of fidelity loss. In all cases the measurable fidelity decrease is directly related to the strength of the noise affecting the implementation, quantified by the trace of the superoperator describing the non-unitary dynamics. While the scalability of our stochastic protocol makes it most relevant in large Hilbert spaces (when quantum process tomography is infeasible), our method should be immediately useful for evaluating the degree of control that is achievable in any prototype quantum processing device. By varying over different experimental arrangements and error-correction strategies, additional information about the noise can be determined.}

	abstract = {The emergence of statistical mechanics for isolated classical systems comes about through chaotic dynamics and ergodicity. Here we review how similar questions can be answered in quantum systems. The crucial point is that individual energy eigenstates behave in many ways like a statistical ensemble. A more detailed statement of this is named the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). The reasons for why it works in so many cases are rooted in the early work of Wigner on random matrix theory and our understanding of quantum chaos. The ETH has now been studied extensively by both analytic and numerical means, and applied to a number of physical situations ranging from black hole physics to condensed matter systems. It has recently become the focus of a number of experiments in highly isolated systems. Current theoretical work also focuses on where the ETH breaks down leading to new interesting phenomena. This review of the ETH takes a somewhat intuitive approach as to why it works and how this informs our understanding of many body quantum states.}

abstract = { Quantum f-divergences are a quantum generalization of the classical notion of f-divergences, and are a special case of Petz' quasi-entropies. Many well-known distinguishability measures of quantum states are given by, or derived from, f-divergences. Special examples include the quantum relative entropy, the Rényi relative entropies, and the Chernoff and Hoeffding measures. Here we show that the quantum f-divergences are monotonic under substochastic maps whenever the defining function is operator convex. This extends and unifies all previously known monotonicity results for this class of distinguishability measures. We also analyze the case where the monotonicity inequality holds with equality, and extend Petz' reversibility theorem for a large class of f-divergences and other distinguishability measures. We apply our findings to the problem of quantum error correction, and show that if a stochastic map preserves the pairwise distinguishability on a set of states, as measured by a suitable f-divergence, then its action can be reversed on that set by another stochastic map that can be constructed from the original one in a canonical way. We also provide an integral representation for operator convex functions on the positive half-line, which is the main ingredient in extending previously known results on the monotonicity inequality and the case of equality. We also consider some special cases where the convexity of f is sufficient for the monotonicity, and obtain the inverse Hölder inequality for operators as an application. The presentation is completely self-contained and requires only standard knowledge of matrix analysis.}

	abstract = {This paper considers linear-quadratic control of a non-linear dynamical system subject to arbitrary cost. I show that for this class of stochastic control problems the non-linear Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation can be transformed into a linear equation. The transformation is similar to the transformation used to relate the classical Hamilton–Jacobi equation to the Schrödinger equation. As a result of the linearity, the usual backward computation can be replaced by a forward diffusion process that can be computed by stochastic integration or by the evaluation of a path integral. It is shown how in the deterministic limit the Pontryagin minimum principle formalism is recovered. The significance of the path integral approach is that it forms the basis for a number of efficient computational methods, such as Monte Carlo sampling, the Laplace approximation and the variational approximation. We show the effectiveness of the first two methods in a number of examples. Examples are given that show the qualitative difference between stochastic and deterministic control and the occurrence of symmetry breaking as a function of the noise.}

The obtained inequality shows a trade-off relation between the operation time and the physical quantities such as the energy fluctuation and the entropy production. We further identify a quantity characterizing the speed of the state transformation, which appears only when we consider the open system dynamics in the quantum regime. When the thermal relaxation is dominant compared to the unitary dynamics of the system, we show that this quantity is approximated by the energy fluctuation of the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian which is used as a control field in the shortcuts to adiabaticity protocol. We discuss the physical meaning of the obtained quantum speed limit and try to give better intuition about the speed in open quantum systems.}

	abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation–dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.}

In particular, the height distribution of its 1D version was determined exactly for a few special initial conditions. Its relevance in experiments was demonstrated and our understanding of the mathematical structures behind its tractability has deepened considerably. There are also new developments in the applicability of the KPZ universality in wider contexts. This paper is a short introductory review on the basics of the equation and on a few recent topics.}",

The width of the active zone in the ballistic deposition model is found to diverge differently from the mean height, indicating breakdown of the single scaling length assumption in this model. The exponents nu and nu ' describing, respectively, the divergence of the radius and the active zone of the Eden clusters on percolation networks appear to be the same within the statistical errors. The central value of nu ', however, is slightly, but systematically, less than nu . The surface thickness of ballistic deposits is shown to exhibit finite-size scaling.}

abstract = {mVMC (many-variable Variational Monte Carlo) is an open-source software package based on the variational Monte Carlo method applicable for a wide range of Hamiltonians for interacting fermion systems. In mVMC, we introduce more than ten thousands variational parameters and simultaneously optimize them by using the stochastic reconfiguration (SR) method. In this paper, we explain basics and user interfaces of mVMC. By using mVMC, users can perform the calculation by preparing only one input file of about ten lines for widely studied quantum lattice models, and can also perform it for general Hamiltonians by preparing several additional input files. We show the benchmark results of mVMC for the Hubbard model, the Heisenberg model, and the Kondo-lattice model. These benchmark results demonstrate that mVMC provides ground-state and low-energy-excited-state wave functions for interacting fermion systems with high accuracy.
Program summary
Program title: mVMC Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/xhgyp6ncvt.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License version 3 Programming language: C External routines/libraries: MPI, BLAS, LAPACK, Pfapack, ScaLAPACK (optional) Nature of problem: Physical properties (such as the charge/spin structure factors) of strongly correlated electrons at zero temperature. Solution method: Application software based on the variational Monte Carlo method for quantum lattice model such as the Hubbard model, the Heisenberg model and the Kondo model. Unusual features: It is possible to perform the highly-accurate calculations for ground states in a wide range of theoretical Hamiltonians in quantum many-body systems. In addition to the conventional orders such as magnetic and/or charge orders, user can treat the anisotropic superconductivities within the same framework. This flexibility is the main advantage of mVMC.}

abstract = {The study of monotone inner products under stochastic mappings on the space of matrices was initiated by Morozova and Chentsov, motivated by information geometry. They did not show a monotone metric, but proposed several candidates. The main result of the present paper is to provide an abundance of monotone metrics by means of operator monotone functions and to characterize them. It turns out that there is a correspondence between monotone metrics and operator means in the sense of Kubo and Ando. It follows that all proposals of Morozova and Chentsov are indeed monotone metrics.}

In such a geometrisation, the scalar curvature, R, plays a central role. A non-interacting model has a flat geometry (R=0), while R diverges at the critical point of an interacting one. Here, the information geometry is studied for a number of solvable statistical–mechanical models.}

This article reviews recent progress in applying the principles of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics to form a systematic theory of the behavior of collections of active particles–active matter–with only minimal regard to microscopic details. A unified view of the many kinds of active matter is presented, encompassing not only living systems but inanimate analogs. Theory and experiment are discussed side by side. }

This model is solved in the replica-symmetric ansatz, which is valid in the high-temperature, disordered phase. It is shown that in the phase in which languages carry information, the replica symmetry must be broken.}

We argue that the distinctive ontogenesis of child language arises from the interplay of three factors: domain-specific principles of language (Universal Grammar), external experience, and properties of non-linguistic domains of cognition including general learning mechanisms and principles of efficient computation. We review developmental evidence that children make use of hierarchically composed structures (‘Merge’) from the earliest stages and at all levels of linguistic organization. At the same time, longitudinal trajectories of development show sensitivity to the quantity of specific patterns in the input, which suggests the use of probabilistic processes as well as inductive learning mechanisms that are suitable for the psychological constraints on language acquisition. By considering the place of language in human biology and evolution, we propose an approach that integrates principles from Universal Grammar and constraints from other domains of cognition. We outline some initial results of this approach as well as challenges for future research.}

Moreover, we introduce the Left-to-Right Inside algorithm, which computes the probability that successive applications of the grammar rewriting rules (beginning with the sentence start symbol s) produce a word string whose initial substring is a given one.",

abstract = { Flocking is a paradigmatic case of self-organized collective behavior in biology and a living example of active matter. Several models and theories have been developed in recent years to address these kinds of systems. However, unlike granular materials and biological systems at the microscale, experiments have been scarce until recently, preventing the necessary comparison between theory and data. In this review, we discuss a novel approach to flocking, in which experimental data are used as a starting point to empirically characterize flocking as a collective phenomenon—as the term is understood in statistical and condensed matter physics—and build models directly from the data. }

abstract = {Collective cell migration in tissues occurs throughout embryonic development, during wound healing, and in cancerous tumor invasion, yet most detailed knowledge of cell migration comes from single-cell studies. As single cells migrate, the shape of the cell body fluctuates dramatically through cyclic processes of extension, adhesion, and retraction, accompanied by erratic changes in migration direction. Within confluent cell layers, such subcellular motions must be coupled between neighbors, yet the influence of these subcellular motions on collective migration is not known. Here we study motion within a confluent epithelial cell sheet, simultaneously measuring collective migration and subcellular motions, covering a broad range of length scales, time scales, and cell densities. At large length scales and time scales collective migration slows as cell density rises, yet the fastest cells move in large, multicell groups whose scale grows with increasing cell density. This behavior has an intriguing analogy to dynamic heterogeneities found in particulate systems as they become more crowded and approach a glass transition. In addition we find a diminishing self-diffusivity of short-wavelength motions within the cell layer, and growing peaks in the vibrational density of states associated with cooperative cell-shape fluctuations. Both of these observations are also intriguingly reminiscent of a glass transition. Thus, these results provide a broad and suggestive analogy between cell motion within a confluent layer and the dynamics of supercooled colloidal and molecular fluids approaching a glass transition.}

Bain and Bartolo applied a fluid-like model to the behavior of marathon runners as they walked up to the start line of the Chicago Marathon (see the Perspective by Ouellette). They observed nondamping linear waves with the same speed for different starting corrals of runners and at different races around the world. Their model should apply both to this type of polarized crowd as well as to other groups, which may help guide crowd management. Science, this issue p. 46; see also p. 27 A fluid-like model describes the motion of a polarized crowd subject to small amplitude perturbations. Modeling crowd motion is central to situations as diverse as risk prevention in mass events and visual effects rendering in the motion picture industry. The difficulty of performing quantitative measurements in model experiments has limited our ability to model pedestrian flows. We use tens of thousands of road-race participants in starting corrals to elucidate the flowing behavior of polarized crowds by probing its response to boundary motion. We establish that speed information propagates over system-spanning scales through polarized crowds, whereas orientational fluctuations are locally suppressed. Building on these observations, we lay out a hydrodynamic theory of polarized crowds and demonstrate its predictive power. We expect this description of human groups as active continua to provide quantitative guidelines for crowd management.}

Such systems are made of interacting agents able to extract energy stored in the environment to produce sustained directed motion. The local conversion of energy into mechanical work drives the system far from equilibrium, yielding new dynamics and phases. The emerging phenomena can be classified depending on the symmetry of the active particles and on the type of microscopic interactions. We focus here on steric and aligning interactions, as well as interactions driven by shape changes. The models that we present are all inspired by experimental realizations of either synthetic, biomimetic or living systems. Based on minimal ingredients, they are meant to bring a simple and synthetic understanding of the complex phenomenology of active matter.}

Entanglement theory does not escape from its influence. Thus the interconversion of bipartite pure states by means of local manipulations turns out to be ruled to a great extend by majorization relations. This review both introduces some elements of majorization theory and describes recent results on bipartite entanglement transformations, with special emphasis being placed on explaining the connections between these two topics. The latter implies analyzing two other aspects of quantum mechanics similarly influenced by majorization, namely the problem of mixing of quantum states and the characterization of quantum measurement.},

Recently, a pioneering study by Ballerini et al., 2008a, Ballerini et al., 2008b suggested that the interactions of birds in a flock should be modeled using the topological distance rather than the metric distance. The concept of topological distance is deemed important for explaining collective behavior. However, few studies have discussed the distinctions between the metric and topological distances. In this paper, we clarify the difference between models based on the topological and metric distances and propose a new hybrid model of these models. The agent of our model switches between these two interactions by tuning the threshold parameters. We show that this hybrid flocking model has the medium property between the metric and the topological distance. In other words, the agents of our hybrid model can dramatically make and divide flock by tuning their neighborhoods. This result suggests that making and dividing flock would be deeply connected with animal's cognition.}

It is applied in two and three dimensions in order to evaluate critical quantities, including the renormalized coupling constant of the corresponding field theory. A simple minimization of finite size effects is shown to give a realistic determination of these numbers from quite small lattices.}

journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
abstract = {Considering a gas of self-propelled particles with binary interactions, we derive the hydrodynamic equations governing the density and velocity fields from the microscopic dynamics, in the framework of the associated Boltzmann equation. Explicit expressions for the transport coefficients are given, as a function of the microscopic parameters of the model. We show that the homogeneous state with zero hydrodynamic velocity is unstable above a critical density (which depends on the microscopic parameters), signalling the onset of a collective motion. Comparison with numerical simulations on a standard model of self-propelled particles shows that the phase diagram we obtain is robust, in the sense that it depends only slightly on the precise definition of the model. While the homogeneous flow is found to be stable far from the transition line, it becomes unstable with respect to finite-wavelength perturbations close to the transition, implying a non-trivial spatio-temporal structure for the resulting flow. We find solitary wave solutions of the hydrodynamic equations, quite similar to the stripes reported in direct numerical simulations of self-propelled particles.}

abstract = {In the development of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum there is a stage in which the aggregated amoebae form a migrating slug that moves forward in a polar fashion, showing sensitive orientation to environmental cues, as well as early signs of differentiation into anterior prestalk and posterior prespore cells. Heretofore it has been difficult to follow the movement of the individual cells within the slug, but a new method is described in which small, flat (one cell thick) slugs are produced in a glass-mineral oil interface where one can follow the movement of all the cells. Observations of time-lapse videos reveal the following facts about slug migration: (i) While the posterior cells move straight forward, the anterior cells swirl about rapidly in a chaotic fashion. (ii) Turning involves shifting the high point of these hyperactive cells. (iii) Both the anterior and the posterior cells move forward on their own power as the slug moves forward. (iv) There are no visible regular oscillations within the slug. (v) The number of prestalk and prespore cells is proportional for a range of sizes of these mini-slugs. All of these observations on thin slugs are consistent with what one finds in normal, three-dimensional slugs.}

abstract = {At SIGMOD 2015, an article was presented with the title “DBSCAN Revisited: Mis-Claim, Un-Fixability, and Approximation” that won the conference’s best paper award. In this technical correspondence, we want to point out some inaccuracies in the way DBSCAN was represented, and why the criticism should have been directed at the assumption about the performance of spatial index structures such as R-trees and not at an algorithm that can use such indexes. We will also discuss the relationship of DBSCAN performance and the indexability of the dataset, and discuss some heuristics for choosing appropriate DBSCAN parameters. Some indicators of bad parameters will be proposed to help guide future users of this algorithm in choosing parameters such as to obtain both meaningful results and good performance. In new experiments, we show that the new SIGMOD 2015 methods do not appear to offer practical benefits if the DBSCAN parameters are well chosen and thus they are primarily of theoretical interest. In conclusion, the original DBSCAN algorithm with effective indexes and reasonably chosen parameter values performs competitively compared to the method proposed by Gan and Tao.},

abstract = {In order to keep their cohesiveness during locomotion gregarious animals must make collective decisions. Many species boast complex societies with multiple levels of communities. A common case is when two dominant levels exist, one corresponding to leaders and the other consisting of followers. In this paper we study the collective motion of such two-level assemblies of self-propelled particles. We present a model adapted from one originally proposed to describe the movement of cells resulting in a smoothly varying coherent motion. We shall use the terminology corresponding to large groups of some mammals where leaders and followers form a group called a harem. We study the emergence (self-organization) of sub-groups within a herd during locomotion by computer simulations. The resulting processes are compared with our prior observations of a Przewalski horse herd (Hortobágy, Hungary) which we use as results from a published case study. We find that the model reproduces key features of a herd composed of harems moving on open ground, including fights for followers between leaders and bachelor groups (group of leaders without followers). One of our findings, however, does not agree with the observations. While in our model the emerging group size distribution is normal, the group size distribution of the observed herd based on historical data have been found to follow lognormal distribution. We argue that this indicates that the formation (and the size) of the harems must involve a more complex social topology than simple spatial-distance based interactions.}
