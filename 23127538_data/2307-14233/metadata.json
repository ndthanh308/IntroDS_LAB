  "abstract": "Insects, pick-and-place manufacturing, engineered adhesives, and soft robots employ soft materials to stick to surfaces even in the presence of roughness. Experiments show that the force required for making contact is lower than for releasing it, a phenomenon known as the adhesion hysteresis. The common explanation for this hysteresis is either contact aging or viscoelasticity. Here, we show that adhesion hysteresis emerges even for perfectly elastic contacts and in the absence of contact aging and viscoelasticity because of surface roughness. We present a crack-perturbation model and experimental observations that reveal discrete jumps of the contact perimeter. These stick-slip instabilities are triggered by local differences in fracture energy between roughness peaks and valleys. Pinning of the contact perimeter retards both its advancement when coming into contact and its retraction when pulling away. Our model quantitatively reproduces the hysteresis observed in experiments and allows us to derive analytical predictions for its magnitude, accounting for realistic rough geometries across orders of magnitude in length scale. Our results explain why adhesion hysteresis is ubiquitous and reveal why soft pads in nature and engineering are efficient in adhering even to surfaces with significant roughness.",
