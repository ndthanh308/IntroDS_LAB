@article{schuller2018_shape-representation-by-zippables,
	abstract = {Fabrication from developable parts is the basis for arts such as papercraft and needlework, as well as modern architecture and CAD in general, and it has inspired much research. We observe that the assembly of complex 3D shapes created by existing methods often requires first fabricating many small parts and then carefully following instructions to assemble them together. Despite its significance, this error prone and tedious process is generally neglected in the discussion. We present the concept of zippables - single, two dimensional, branching, ribbon-like pieces of fabric that can be quickly zipped up without any instructions to form 3D objects. Our inspiration comes from the so-called zipit bags [zipit 2017], which are made of a single, long ribbon with a zipper around its boundary. In order to "assemble" the bag, one simply needs to zip up the ribbon. Our method operates in the same fashion, but it can be used to approximate a wide variety of shapes. Given a 3D model, our algorithm produces plans for a single 2D shape that can be laser cut in few parts from fabric or paper. A zipper can then be attached along the boundary by sewing, or by gluing using a custom-built fastening rig. We show physical and virtual results that demonstrate the capabilities of our method and the ease with which shapes can be assembled.},

@article{allen2015_an-experimental-demonstration-of-effective-curved-layer,
	abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is an additive manufacturing (AM) method that relies on the thermal extrusion of a thermoplastic feedstock from a mobile deposition head. Conventional FFF constructs components from stacks of individual extruded layers using tool paths with fixed z-values in each individual layer. Consequently, the manufactured components often contain inherent weaknesses in the z-axis due to the relatively weak thermal fusion bonding that occurs between individual layers, as well as poor surface finish in shallow sloped contours. This study demonstrates the use of Curved Layer FFF (CLFFF) tool paths in tandem with a commercially available parallel, or delta, style FFF system to allow the deposition head to follow the topology of the component. By incorporating a delta robot and CLFFF tool paths in this way, improvements in the surface finish of the manufactured parts has been observed, and time costs associated with Cartesian robot based CLFFF manufacturing have been notably reduced. Furthermore, employing a delta robot provides additional flexibility to CLFFF manufacturing and increases the feasibility of its application for advanced manufacturing. The study has also demonstrated a viable approach to multi-material FFF by decoupling support structure and part manufacture into regions of CLFFF and static z tool pathing in an appropriate fashion.},

@article{huang2015_a-mixed-layer-approach-combining-both-flat,
	abstract = { Fused deposition modelling is one of the additive manufacturing techniques in which part quality is often influenced by stair-step effects and internal meso-structures. Adaptive slicing employing slices of varying thicknesses was attempted as a means of overcoming some of these problems, but with limited success, while speed and time of printing often lead to further complications. On the other hand, curved layer deposition is proved to improve surface quality and part strength in specific cases. This research brings both flat and curved layer approaches together through specific algorithms developed and employed combining the two to process given parts. The mixed slicing method is applied successfully to three test cases, practically implemented on a test bed, and proved to be feasible and effective. },

For most technologies, stairstepping artifacts impair the surface quality of 3D printed objects, especially when the surface slope is close to horizontal.In this paper we propose a novel Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) slicing approach that combines nonplanar and planar layers, increasing printing quality and resulting in smoother, stronger object surfaces. Our slicing algorithm automatically detects which parts of the object should be printed with nonplanar layers and uses a geometric model of the printhead and extruder to generate collision-free toolpaths.Our open source implementation is based on the popular Slic3r tool and can be used on all common three-axis 3D printers. We present typical printing results and compare surface quality as well as slicing and printing times with traditional and adaptive planar slicing.},

@article{lim2016_modelling-curved-layered-printing-paths-for-fabricating,
	abstract = {In this paper, a non-conventional way of additive manufacturing, curved-layered printing, has been applied to large-scale construction process. Despite the number of research works on Curved Layered Fused Deposition Modelling (CLFDM) over the last decade, few practical applications have been reported. An alternative method adopting the CLFDM principle, that generates a curved-layered printing path, was developed using a single scripting environment called Grasshopper -- a plugin of Rhinoceros{\textregistered}. The method was evaluated with the 3D Concrete Printing process developed at Loughborough University. The evaluation of the method including the results of simulation and printing revealed three principal benefits compared with existing flat-layered printing paths, which are particularly beneficial to large-scale AM techniques: (i) better surface quality, (ii) shorter printing time and (iii) higher surface strengths.},

@article{verhoeven2022_dev2pq:-planar-quadrilateral-strip-remeshing,
	abstract = {We introduce an algorithm to remesh triangle meshes representing developable surfaces to planar quad dominant meshes. The output of our algorithm consists of planar quadrilateral (PQ) strips that are aligned to principal curvature directions and closely approximate the curved parts of the input developable, and planar polygons representing the flat parts of the input that connect the PQ strips. Developable PQ-strip meshes are useful in many areas of shape modeling, thanks to the simplicity of fabrication from flat sheet material. Unfortunately, they are difficult to model due to their restrictive combinatorics. Other representations of developable surfaces, such as arbitrary triangle or quad meshes, are more suitable for interactive freeform modeling but generally have non-planar faces or are not aligned to principal curvatures. Our method leverages the modeling flexibility of non-ruling-based representations of developable surfaces while still obtaining developable, curvature-aligned PQ-strip meshes. Our algorithm optimizes for a scalar function on the input mesh, such that its isolines are extrinsically straight and align well to the locally estimated ruling directions. The condition that guarantees straight isolines is non-linear of high order and numerically difficult to enforce in a straightforward manner. We devise an alternating optimization method that makes our problem tractable and practical to compute. Our method works automatically on any developable input, including multiple patches and curved folds, without explicit domain decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of developable surfaces and show how our remeshing can be used alongside handle-based interactive freeform modeling of developable shapes.},

@article{tam2017_additive-manufacturing-along-principal-stress,
	abstract = { Abstract Optimization techniques developed for additive manufacturing (AM) to maximize the structural stiffness of printed parts are often computationally expensive reformulations of classical procedures that do not typically consider the mechanical behavior introduced to the printed part by the AM fabrication process, which is layer-based, and result in pieces with significant anisotropy. The misalignment of filament orientation and structural action negates the potential benefits of optimization. Addressing this problem, this article presents a two-part research approach exploring a new method of material deposition called Stress Line Additive Manufacturing (SLAM), which deposits filament along paths derived from principal stress lines. The proposed method unifies the design and optimization of the geometry and filament layout of AM-produced parts, and is compatible to the operational characteristics of fused deposition modeling (FDM). Experimentally validating the structural significance of oriented filament, the first part of the research implements SLAM on a commercial platform for planar design cases. Ongoing research to adapt SLAM for complex 2.5D surface geometries using a six-axis industrial robot arm and a custom-designed heated extruder is then presented in Implementation 2: Robot-Enabled SLAM for 2.5-D Cases. The presented research opens new possibilities for structurally performative fabrication. },

The approach is based on novel biharmonic and m-harmonic energies for n-fields on surface meshes and the integration of hard constraints to the resulting optimization problems. Real-time computation rates are achieved by a model reduction approach employing a Fourier-like n-vector field decomposition, which associates frequencies and modes to n-vector fields on surfaces. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed n-field modeling approach, we use it for controlling stroke directions in line-art drawings of surfaces and for the modeling of anisotropic BRDFs, which define the reflection behavior of surfaces.},

This yields a variety of theoretical tools for efficiently computing boundary-aligned quad meshes, with provable guarantees on the resulting mesh, such as the number of mesh defects and bounds on the defect locations. The procedure for generating the quad mesh is to (i) find a complex-valued ``representation'' field that minimizes the Ginzburg--Landau energy subject to a boundary constraint, (ii) convert the representation field into a boundary-aligned, smooth cross field, (iii) use separatrices of the cross field to partition the domain into four-sided regions, and (iv) mesh each of these four-sided regions using standard techniques. Leveraging the Ginzburg--Landau theory, we prove that this procedure can be used to produce a cross field whose separatrices partition the domain into four-sided regions. To minimize the Ginzburg--Landau energy for the representation field, we use an extension of the Merriman--Bence--Osher threshold dynamics method, originally conceived as an algorithm to simulate mean curvature flow. Finally, we demonstrate the method on a variety of test domains. },

@article{liu2020_practical-fabrication-of-discrete-chebyshev-nets,
	abstract = {Abstract We propose a computational and practical technique to allow home users to fabricate discrete Chebyshev nets for various 3D models. The success of our method relies on two key components. The first one is a novel and simple method to approximate discrete integrable, unit-length, and angle-bounded frame fields, used to model discrete Chebyshev nets. Central to our field generation process is an alternating algorithm that takes turns executing one pass to enforce integrability and another pass to approach unit length while bounding angles. The second is a practical fabrication specification. The discrete Chebyshev net is first partitioned into a set of patches to facilitate manufacturing. Then, each patch is assigned a specification on pulling, bend, and fold to fit the nets. We demonstrate the capability and feasibility of our method in various complex models.},

@article{meekes2021_unconventional-patterns-on-surfaces,
	abstract = {We present a unified method to meshing surfaces with unconventional patterns, both periodic and aperiodic. These patterns, which have so far been studied on the plane, are patterns comprising a small number of tiles, that do not necessarily exhibit translational periodicity. Our method generalizes the de Bruijn multigrid method to the discrete setting, and thus reduces the problem to the computation of N-Directional fields on triangle meshes. We work with all cases of directional symmetries that have been little studied, including odd and high N. We address the properties of such patterns on surfaces and the challenges in their construction, including order-preservation, seamlessness, duality, and singularities. We show how our method allows for the design of original and unconventional meshes that can be applied to architectural, industrial, and recreational design.},

@article{takayama2013_sketch-based-generation-and-editing-of-quad-meshes,
	abstract = {Coarse quad meshes are the preferred representation for animating characters in movies and video games. In these scenarios, artists want explicit control over the edge flows and the singularities of the quad mesh. Despite the significant advances in recent years, existing automatic quad remeshing algorithms are not yet able to achieve the quality of manually created remeshings. We present an interactive system for manual quad remeshing that provides the user with a high degree of control while avoiding the tediousness involved in existing manual tools. With our sketch-based interface the user constructs a quad mesh by defining patches consisting of individual quads. The desired edge flow is intuitively specified by the sketched patch boundaries, and the mesh topology can be adjusted by varying the number of edge subdivisions at patch boundaries. Our system automatically inserts singularities inside patches if necessary, while providing the user with direct control of their topological and geometrical locations. We developed a set of novel user interfaces that assist the user in constructing a curve network representing such patch boundaries. The effectiveness of our system is demonstrated through a user evaluation with professional artists. Our system is also useful for editing automatically generated quad meshes.},

We argue that our editing operations are fundamental, because they only change the quad mesh in the smallest possible region and involve the fewest irregular vertices (ie., two). The irregular vertex movement operations are supplemented by operations for the splitting, merging, canceling, and aligning of irregular vertices. We explain how the proposed high-level operations are realized through graph-level editing operations such as quad collapses, edge flips, and edge splits. The utility of these mesh editing operations are demonstrated by improving the connectivity of quad meshes generated from state-of-art quadrangulation techniques.},

@inproceedings{goes2016_vector-field-processing-on-triangle-meshes,
	abstract = {While scalar fields on surfaces have been staples of geometry processing, the use of tangent vector fields has steadily grown in geometry processing over the last two decades: they are crucial to encode both directions and sizing on surfaces as commonly required in tasks such as texture synthesis, non-photorealistic rendering, digital grooming, and meshing. There are, however, a variety of discrete representations of tangent vector fields on triangle meshes, and each approach offers different trade-offs among simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy depending on the targeted application.This course reviews the three main families of discretizations used to design computational tools for vector field processing on triangle meshes: face-based, edge-based, and vertex-based representations. In the process of reviewing the computational tools offered by these representations, we go over a large body of recent developments in vector field processing in the area of discrete differential geometry. We also discuss the theoretical and practical limitations of each type of discretization, and cover increasingly-common extensions such as n-direction and n-vector fields.While the course will focus on explaining the key approaches to practical encoding (including data structures) and manipulation (including discrete operators) of finite-dimensional vector fields, important differential geometric notions will also be covered: as often in Discrete Differential Geometry, the discrete picture will be used to illustrate deep continuous concepts such as covariant derivatives, metric connections, or Bochner Laplacians.},

@article{keating2013_compound-fabrication:-a-multi-functional-robotic-platform,
	abstract = {Supporting various applications of digital fabrication and manufacturing, the industrial robot is typically assigned repetitive tasks for specific pre-programmed and singular applications. We propose a novel approach for robotic fabrication and manufacturing entitled Compound Fabrication, supporting multi-functional and multi-material processes. This approach combines the major manufacturing technologies including additive, formative and subtractive fabrication, as well as their parallel integration. A 6-axis robotic arm, repurposed as an integrated 3D printing, milling and sculpting platform, enables shifting between fabrication modes and across scales using different end effectors. Promoting an integrated approach to robotic fabrication, novel combination processes are demonstrated including 3D printing and milling fabrication composites. In addition, novel robotic fabrication processes are developed and evaluated, such as multi-axis plastic 3D printing, direct recycling 3D printing, and embedded printing. The benefits and limitations of the Compound Fabrication approach and its experimental platform are reviewed and discussed. Finally, contemplation regarding the future of multi-functional robotic fabrication is offered, in the context of the experiments reviewed and demonstrated in this paper.},

abstract = {Current CAD modeling techniques enable the design of objects with aesthetically pleasing smooth freeform surfaces. However, the fabrication of these freeform shapes remains challenging. Our novel method uses orthogonal principal strips to fabricate objects whose boundary consists of freeform surfaces. This approach not only lends an artistic touch to the appearance of objects, but also provides directions for reinforcement, as the surface is mostly bent along the lines of curvature. Moreover, it is unnecessary to adjust the bending of these orthogonal strips during the construction process, which automatically reforms the design shape as if it is memorized, provided the strips possess bending rigidity. Our method relies on semi-isometric mapping, which preserves the length of boundary curves, and approximates angles between boundary curves under local minimization. Applications include the fabrication of paper and sheet metal craft, and architectural models using plastic plates. We applied our technique to several freeform objects to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.},

abstract="Rationalization of architectural freeform structures using planar quadrilateral (PQ) meshes has received rising interest in recent years, facilitated mainly by the introduction of algorithms which are capable of generating such. These algorithms involve an optimization which is, up to now, motivated purely geometrically and accounts for aspects of feasibility, visual appearance, and approximation of the architectural design. Practitioners would wish to add stiffness to the objectives of the layout process. This paper presents a simple but effective statics-aware initialization procedure for the layout of PQ meshes approximating a given freeform surface. We focus on the class of surface structures with membrane-like load bearing behavior, quite regularly encountered in architecture. By compliance analysis of two representative examples, we demonstrate that this specific type of initialization has indeed favorable impact on the mechanical properties of the final PQ mesh.",

abstract = {In architectural freeform design, the relation between shape and fabrication poses new challenges and requires more sophistication from the underlying geometry. The new concept of conical meshes satisfies central requirements for this application: They are quadrilateral meshes with planar faces, and therefore particularly suitable for the design of freeform glass structures. Moreover, they possess a natural offsetting operation and provide a support structure orthogonal to the mesh. Being a discrete analogue of the network of principal curvature lines, they represent fundamental shape characteristics. We show how to optimize a quad mesh such that its faces become planar, or the mesh becomes even conical. Combining this perturbation with subdivision yields a powerful new modeling tool for all types of quad meshes with planar faces, making subdivision attractive for architecture design and providing an elegant way of modeling developable surfaces.},

These partitions can be constructed in sublinear time from a list of the extraordinary vertices in a mesh. We also study the problem of further reducing the number of submeshes in our partitions—we prove that optimizing this number is NP-hard, but it can be efficiently approximated.},

Our algorithm creates large rectangular patches by relaxing the notion of motorcycle graphs and making it insensitive to local irregularities in the mesh structure such as non-quad elements, redundant irregular vertices, T-junctions, and others. Each surface patch, which can contain multiple singularities and/or polygonal elements, is mapped to an axis-aligned rectangle, leading to a simple and efficient UV layout, which is ideal for texture mapping (allowing for mipmapping and artifact-free bilinear interpolation). We demonstrate that our algorithm is an ideal solution for both recent semi-regular, quad-dominant meshing methods, and for the low-poly meshes typically used in games and movies.},
