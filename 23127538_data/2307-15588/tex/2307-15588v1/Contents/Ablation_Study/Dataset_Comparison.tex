we analyze the impact of image quality among distinct datasets. While the number of classes and their distribution exhibits similarity across the datasets, the most prominent difference lies in the image quality, as expounded in UrbanLF~\cite{sheng2022urbanlf}.

As shown in Fig~\ref{fig:dataset comparison}, the presence of noise in out-of-focus images leads to performance degradation for LF-IENet$^3$, LF-IENet$^4$, and OCR-LF, resulting in a decline of more than $1\%$ in mIoU.
However, the mIoU score of our OAFuser increases by $1.05\%$.
This improvement contributes to the proposed method and the design of our model, which leverage abundant angular information and rectify features from various viewpoints, consequently reducing the impact of image quality on our model.
For existing works, the improved accuracy values and decreased mAcc also demonstrate the challenges, which is posed by the decrease in image quality in distinguishing different class boundaries. However, our model, while improving classification accuracy, shows a minimal decrease in mAcc $({-}0.05\%)$.
