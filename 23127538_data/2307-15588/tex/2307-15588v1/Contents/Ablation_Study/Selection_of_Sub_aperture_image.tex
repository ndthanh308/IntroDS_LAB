Exploration of the contribution of different numbers of sub-aperture images. mIoU~(\%) is reported. V11 denotes the sub-aperture image from the top-left viewpoint. The best results are highlighted in red.}
\label{tab:Sub-aperture images}
\end{table}

To further prove the contribution of sub-aperture images, several experiments are conducted. As shown in Table~\ref{tab:Sub-aperture images}, compared with our baseline method CMX~\cite{zhang2022cmx}, which is designed for similar modalities fusion, our OAFuser achieves an increase of more than $2\%$ in mIoU.
This result further confirms the effectiveness of our design in handling asymmetric data from the light field camera for segmentation tasks.
Furthermore, our network perceives the scene from multiple perspectives, and with the increase of viewpoints, it achieves progressively higher accuracy. This also demonstrates our network's ability to utilize angular information and exhibit the necessity of utilizing more sub-aperture images for segmentation task. OAFuser reaches its peak at OAFuser17.
