The image size for UrbanLF-Syn is $640{\times}480$ while applying zero padding converts samples in UrbanLF-Real into a size of $640{\times}480$.
Data augmentation is applied with random flipping with a probability of $0.5$, random scaling factors $\{0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75\}$, normalization with mean factors $\{0.485, 0.456, 0.406\}$, and standard deviation factors $\{0.229, 0.224, 0.225\}$.
We use the AdamW optimizer with momentum parameters $\{0.9, 0.999\}$ and a weight decay of $0.01$.
The original learning rate is set to ${6e}^{-5}$ and scheduled using the polynomial strategy with a power of $0.9$.
The first $10$ epochs are used to warm up the models.

For experiments on the three different datasets, the training process adapts on three A40 GPUs with a batch size of $3$ on each GPU and the number of training epochs is limited to a maximum of $500$, and the model is based on the MiT-B4 per-train weight~\cite{xie2021segformer}.
For the ablation study of architecture, we train our model with MiT-B2~\cite{xie2021segformer} on one A5000 GPU with a batch size of $2$ and epoch $200$.
With the MiT-B0~\cite{xie2021segformer} on one A5000 GPU with a batch size of $2$, we conduct an ablation study on the CARM and the investigation on the selection of sub-aperture images.
{For the selection of sub-aperture images, we choose images that are rich in angular information, mainly in the diagonal, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:light array}. The experiments on the selection strategy of sub-aperture light-field images are discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:5_d_select}.}
