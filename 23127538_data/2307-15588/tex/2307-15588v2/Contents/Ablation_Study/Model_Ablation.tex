\caption{Ablation study of the OAFuser framework.}
\label{tab:ablationstudy for model}
\end{table}

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:ablationstudy for model}, we ablate our OAFuser structure gradually.
When removing the CARM and replacing it with the Feature
Rectification Module (FRM)~\cite{zhang2022cmx}.
The accuracy dramatically decreases by $2.17\%$.
Although the number of parameters is also reduced, our CARM module is essential to overcome challenges such as image mismatching and out-of-focus issues.
Besides, we ablate the components of SAFM progressively, \ie, {using SAFM in the first or last stage, and without SAFM. The performances of these three variants are decreased significantly ($2{\sim}3\%$ drops compared to OAFuser). }
%
Especially notably in these variants, the number of parameters remains unchanged, as the angle information is obtained through channel-level feature aggregation with shared weights.
This also validates that the introduction of the SAFM efficiently achieves the selection and fusion of rich information from the {LF} camera, and the network has the capability to handle arbitrary sub-aperture images.
{Furthermore, the FFM~\cite{zhang2022cmx} is also essential since combining complementary features is crucial in the LF semantic segmentation task.}

Moreover, we conduct visualization comparisons in this ablation study. Fig.~\ref{fig:ARlation} illustrates the difference maps of the cropped region compared to the ground-truth mask, which is generated by the overall OAFuser model, the one without CARM and the other without CARM and SAFM, respectively. The visualization result indicates the effectiveness of using CARM and SAFM for light-field semantic segmentation. %
