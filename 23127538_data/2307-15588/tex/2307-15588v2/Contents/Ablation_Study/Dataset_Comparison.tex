{To further prove the performance of our network, %
we analyze the impact of image quality among distinct datasets. {While the number of classes and their distribution exhibit similarity across the datasets,} the most prominent difference lies in the image quality, as expounded in UrbanLF~\cite{sheng2022urbanlf}.

As shown in Fig~\ref{fig:dataset comparison}, the presence of noise in out-of-focus images leads to performance degradation for LF-IENet$^3$, LF-IENet$^4$, and OCR-LF, resulting in a decline of more than $1\%$ in mIoU.
However, the mIoU score of our OAFuser increases by $1.05\%$.
{This improvement contributes to the proposed method and the design of our model, which leverages abundant angular information and rectifies features from various viewpoints, consequently reducing the impact of image quality on our model.
For existing works, the improved accuracy values and decreased mAcc also demonstrate the challenges posed by the quality in distinguishing different class boundaries. However, while improving classification accuracy, our model shows a minimal decrease in mAcc $({-}0.05\%)$.}}
