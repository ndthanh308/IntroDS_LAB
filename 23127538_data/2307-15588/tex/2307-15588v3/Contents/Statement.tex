{\revised{To solve the data abundance problem}, we have reduced the significant computational consumption of light field cameras while not introducing any additional parameters. \revised{The proposed method} has practical value for the deployment and application of light field cameras.} The proposed method provides a scalable solution for scene parsing tasks based on light field cameras. \revised{We hope that this study will promote the development of light field cameras in the field of scene understanding.}
