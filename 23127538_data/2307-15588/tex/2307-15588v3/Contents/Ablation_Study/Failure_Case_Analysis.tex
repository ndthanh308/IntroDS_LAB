{Although OAFuser has \revised{exhibits} state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, an analysis of the visual results presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:Failure_Cases} suggests considerable \revised{room} for improvement in complex and occluded scenarios. \revised{The results obtained} on the synthetic dataset show that all approaches demonstrate significant errors in regions where vehicles, suspension bridges, and road surfaces intersect. Although OAFuser, unlike other methods, identifies the road surface to some extent, it erroneously interprets it as a pedestrian crossing. In the middle column, where mirrors and other objects appear together in the scene, \revised{OAFuser outperforms the other methods in recognizing the signs; none of the methods recognizes the surrounding objects.} In the rightmost column, the presence of fences, due to their slender volume and frequent co-occurrence with other objects, \revised{poses a significant challenge} to the ability of the network to recognize them. \revised{The previous methods} have almost completely failed to detect fences, and OAFuser has only managed to recognize a small portion of them, which is of poor quality. In zones with \revised{overlapped vehicles, buildings, and fences}, OAFuser also exhibits recognition errors. These results demonstrate that LF semantic segmentation still requires further exploration. \revised{The proposed method significantly reduces floating-point operations and achieves state-of-the-art performance; however, further exploration is required to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency.}}
