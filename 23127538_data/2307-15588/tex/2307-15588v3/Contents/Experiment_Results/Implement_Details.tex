The image size for UrbanLF-Syn is $640{\times}480$, \revised{whereas} applying zero padding converts samples in UrbanLF-Real into a size of $640{\times}480$.
Data augmentation is applied with random flipping with a probability of $0.5$, random scaling factors $\{0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75\}$, normalization with mean factors $\{0.485, 0.456, 0.406\}$, and standard deviation factors $\{0.229, 0.224, 0.225\}$.
We use the AdamW optimizer with momentum parameters $\{0.9, 0.999\}$ and a weight decay of $0.01$.
The initial learning rate is set to ${6e}^{-5}$ and scheduled using the polynomial strategy with a power of $0.9$.
The first $10$ epochs are used to warm up the models.

\revised{For experiments on the four different datasets, the training process is performed on three A40 GPUs with a batch size of $3$ on each GPU, and the number of training epochs is limited to a maximum of $500$. The model is based on the MiT-B4 per-train weight~\cite{xie2021segformer}. \revised{To demonstrate model effectiveness across different} module scales, several experiments are conducted on various model scales~\ie, MiT-B4, MiT-B2, and MiT-B0.} For the ablation study of architecture, we train our model with MiT-B2~\cite{xie2021segformer} on one A5000 GPU with a batch size of $2$ and \revised{a number of} epochs of $200$ in Section~\ref{sec:5_a_model}.
With the MiT-B0~\cite{xie2021segformer} on one A5000 GPU with a batch size of $2$, we conduct an ablation study on the CARM (in Section~\ref{sec:5_a_ma}), the computational cost analysis, and the investigation on the selection of \revised{SAIs} (in Section~\ref{sec:5_d_select}).
\revised{{For the selection of SAIs, we choose images that are rich in angular information. Following the methodology of~\cite{sheng2022urbanlf,chen2023light}, the images are mainly selected along the diagonal, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:light array}.}}

%The experiments on the contributions of sub-aperture light-field images with varying numbers to scene understanding are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:5_d_select}.
