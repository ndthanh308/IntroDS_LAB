  "abstract": "During a screening in ASAS-SN database searching candidates of Delta Scuti stars with short period, our attention was drawn to the variable star ASASSN-V J104912.47+274312.7, we considered interesting to follow. It is an ASAS-SN discovery, classified by them as a RRc. We observed it for 16 nights in 2021, obtaining several maxima that allow us to refine its period. After a frequency analysis, we conclude that this star belongs to a small subgroup of RRc stars having the peculiarity to show two close frequencies with ratio greater than 0.96, without 0.61 or 0.68 period ratio mode. This behaviour is very similar to two stars found by Netzel & Smolec (2019) in OGLE data, and one star in NGC 6362, studied by Smolec et al. (2017). This large period ratios are also found as additional mode to standard double mode RRc stars (Px/Pl= 0.61-0.68) by Netzel et al. (2023).",
