abstract={Heavy-fermion systems represent one of the paradigmatic strongly correlated states of matter1--5. They have been used as a platform for investigating exotic behaviour ranging from quantum criticality and non-Fermi liquid behaviour to unconventional topological superconductivity4--12. The heavy-fermion phenomenon arises from the exchange interaction between localized magnetic moments and conduction electrons leading to Kondo lattice physics, and represents one of the long-standing open problems in quantum materials3. In a Kondo lattice, the exchange interaction gives rise to a band with heavy effective mass. This intriguing phenomenology has so far been realized only in compounds containing rare-earth elements with 4f or 5f electrons1,4,13,14. Here we realize a designer van der Waals heterostructure where artificial heavy fermions emerge from the Kondo coupling between a lattice of localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons in a 1T/1H-TaS2 heterostructure. We study the heterostructure using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy and show that depending on the stacking order of the monolayers, we can reveal either the localized magnetic moments and the associated Kondo effect, or the conduction electrons with a heavy-fermion hybridization gap. Our experiments realize an ultimately tunable platform for future experiments probing enhanced many-body correlations, dimensional tuning of quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity in two-dimensional artificial heavy-fermion systems15--17.},

abstract={The electron--phonon interaction is a major factor influencing the competition between collective instabilities in correlated-electron materials, but its role in driving high-temperature superconductivity in the cuprates remains poorly understood. We have used high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering to monitor low-energy phonons in YBa2Cu3O6.6 (superconducting transition temperature Tc{\thinspace}={\thinspace}61{\thinspace}K), which is close to a charge-density-wave (CDW) instability. Phonons in a narrow range of momentum space around the CDW ordering vector exhibit extremely large superconductivity-induced line-shape renormalizations. These results imply that the electron--phonon interaction has sufficient strength to generate various anomalies in electronic spectra, but does not contribute significantly to Cooper pairing. In addition, a quasi-elastic `central peak' due to CDW nanodomains is observed in a wide temperature range above and below Tc, suggesting that the gradual onset of a spatially inhomogeneous CDW domain state with decreasing temperature is a generic feature of the underdoped cuprates.},

abstract={Understanding of charge-density wave (CDW) phases is a main challenge in condensed matter due to their presence in high-Tc superconductors or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Among TMDs, the origin of the CDW in VSe2 remains highly debated. Here, by means of inelastic x-ray scattering and first-principles calculations, we show that the CDW transition is driven by the collapse at 110 K of an acoustic mode at qCDW = (2.25 0 0.7) r.l.u. The softening starts below 225 K and expands over a wide region of the Brillouin zone, identifying the electron-phonon interaction as the driving force of the CDW. This is supported by our calculations that determine a large momentum-dependence of the electron-phonon matrix-elements that peak at the CDW wave vector. Our first-principles anharmonic calculations reproduce the temperature dependence of the soft mode and the TCDW onset only when considering the out-of-plane van der Waals interactions, which reveal crucial for the melting of the CDW phase.},

abstract = {Abstract A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 · R−6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol−1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R−6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract={QUANTUM ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling, based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials (norm-conserving, ultrasoft, and projector-augmented wave). The acronym ESPRESSO stands for opEn Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization . It is freely available to researchers around the world under the terms of the GNU General Public License. QUANTUM ESPRESSO builds upon newly-restructured electronic-structure codes that have been developed and tested by some of the original authors of novel electronic-structure algorithms and applied in the last twenty years by some of the leading materials modeling groups worldwide. Innovation and efficiency are still its main focus, with special attention paid to massively parallel architectures, and a great effort being devoted to user friendliness. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is evolving towards a distribution of independent and interoperable codes in the spirit of an open-source project, where researchers active in the field of electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to participate in the project by contributing their own codes or by implementing their own ideas into existing codes.}

Quantum ESPRESSO owes its popularity to the wide variety of properties and processes it allows to simulate, to its performance on an increasingly broad array of hardware architectures, and to a community of researchers that rely on its capabilities as a core open-source development platform to implement their ideas. In this paper we describe recent extensions and improvements, covering new methodologies and property calculators, improved parallelization, code modularization, and extended interoperability both within the distribution and with external software.}

abstract = {Abstract Superconductivity in topological kagome metals has recently received great research interests. Here, charge density wave (CDW) orders and the evolution of superconductivity under various pressures in CsV3Sb5 single crystal with V kagome lattice are investigated. By using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), two CDW orders in CsV3Sb5 are observed which correspond to 4a × 1a and 2a × 2a superlattices. By applying pressure, the superconducting transition temperature Tc is significantly enhanced and reaches a maximum value of 8.2 K at around 1 GPa. Accordingly, CDW state is gradually declined as increasing the pressure, which indicates the competing interplay between CDW and superconducting state in this material. The broad superconducting transitions around 0.4–0.8 GPa can be related to the strong competition relation among two CDW states and superconductivity. These results demonstrate that CsV3Sb5 is a new platform for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and CDW in topological kagome metals.},

abstract={Theoretically, it has been known that breaking spin degeneracy and effectively realizing spinless fermions is a promising path to topological superconductors. Yet, topological superconductors are rare to date. Here we propose to realize spinless fermions by splitting the spin degeneracy in momentum space. Specifically, we identify monolayer hole-doped transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)s as candidates for topological superconductors out of such momentum-space-split spinless fermions. Although electron-doped TMDs have recently been found superconducting, the observed superconductivity is unlikely topological because of the near spin degeneracy. Meanwhile, hole-doped TMDs with momentum-space-split spinless fermions remain unexplored. Employing a renormalization group analysis, we propose that the unusual spin-valley locking in hole-doped TMDs together with repulsive interactions selectively favours two topological superconducting states: interpocket paired state with Chern number 2 and intrapocket paired state with finite pair momentum. A confirmation of our predictions will open up possibilities for manipulating topological superconductors on the device-friendly platform of monolayer TMDs.},

abstract={We have developed the numerical software package chinook for the simulation of photoemission matrix elements. This quantity encodes a depth of information regarding the orbital structure of the underlying wavefunctions from which photoemission occurs. Extraction of this information is often nontrivial, owing to the influence of the experimental geometry and photoelectron interference, precluding straightforward solutions. The chinook code has been designed to simulate and predict the ARPES intensity measured for arbitrary experimental configuration, including photon-energy, polarization, and spin-projection, as well as consideration of both surface-projected slab and bulk models. This framework then facilitates an efficient interpretation of the ARPES, allowing for a deeper understanding of the electronic structure in addition to the design of new experiments which leverage the matrix element effects towards the objective of selective photoemission from states of particular interest.},

abstract = {Helical arrangements of spins are common among magnetic materials. The first material to harbor a corkscrew pattern of charge density, on the other hand, was discovered only very recently. The nature of the order parameter is of key relevance, since rotating a magnetic vector around any propagation vector trivially yields a helical pattern. In contrast, the purely scalar charge density cannot straightforwardly support a chiral state. Here we use a Landau order parameter analysis to resolve this paradox, and show that the chiral charge order may be understood as a form of orbital ordering. We discuss the microscopic mechanism driving the transition and show it to be of a general form, thus allowing for a broad class of materials to display this novel type of orbital-ordered chiral charge density wave.}

Different instrumental methods applied to synchrotron light can transform its natural polarization into an arbitrary polarization state. Several synchrotron applications, in particular in the field of magnetic and resonant scattering rely on the improvement in the signal/noise ratio or the deeper insight into the ordered state and the scattering process made possible through these polarization techniques. Here, we present the mathematical framework for the description of fully and partially polarized X-rays, with some applications such as linear X-ray polarization analysis for the determination of the scattered beam's polarization, and the Ge K-edge resonant scattering.},

	journal = {2D Materials},
	abstract = {Most metallic transition metal dichalcogenides undergo charge density wave (CDW) instabilities with similar or identical ordering vectors in bulk and in single layer, albeit with different critical temperatures. Metallic 1 T-TiTe2 is a remarkable exception as it shows no evidence of charge density wave formation in bulk, but it displays a stable 2 × 2 reconstruction in single-layer form. The mechanism for this 3D-2D crossover of the transition is still unclear, although strain from the substrate and the exchange interaction have been pointed out as possible formation mechanisms. Here, by performing non-perturbative anharmonic calculations with gradient corrected and hybrid functionals, we explain the thickness behaviour of the transition in 1 T-TiTe. We demonstrate that the CDW in single-layer TiTe2 occurs from the interplay of non-perturbative anharmonicity and an exchange enhancement of the electron-phonon interaction, larger in the single layer than in the bulk. Finally, we study the electronic and structural properties of the single-layer CDW phase and provide a complete description of its electronic structure, phonon dispersion as well as infrared and Raman active phonon modes.}

ABSTRACT={Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-VSe<sub>2</sub> exhibits a unique three-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) order below ∼110 K at ambient pressure, which shows unusual evolution under pressure. Here we report on the high-pressure structural and transport properties of 1T-VSe<sub>2</sub> by extending the pressure up to 57.8 GPa, through electrical transport, synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman scattering measurements, which unravel two critical pressure points. The CDW transition is found to be enhanced under compression at a rate of 16.5 K/GPa up to the first critical pressure P<sub>C1</sub> ∼ 12 GPa, at which a structural phase transition from hexagonal P-3m1 to monoclinic C2/m phase takes place. The second critical pressure P<sub>C2</sub> ∼ 33 GPa corresponds to another structural transition from monoclinic C2/m to P2<sub>1</sub>/m phase. These findings extend the phase diagram of pressurized 1T-VSe<sub>2</sub> and may help to understand pressure tuning of structures in transition metal dichalcogenides.}
