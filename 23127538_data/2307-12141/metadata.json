  "abstract": "This is an overview on the {source operator method} which leads to the construction of symmetry breaking differential operators (SBDO) in the context of tensor product of two principals series representations for the conformal group of a simple real Jordan algebra. This method can be applied to other geometric contexts: in the construction of SBDO for differential forms and for spinors, and also for the construction of Juhl's operators corresponding to the restriction from the sphere $S^n$ to $S^{n-1}$.",
