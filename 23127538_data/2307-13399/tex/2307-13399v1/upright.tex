\input{LHCb_Authorship_DD-MMM-20YY}

The author list for journal publications is generated from the
Membership Database shortly after 'approval to go to paper' has been
given.  It will be sent to you by email shortly after a paper number
has been assigned.  The author list should be included in the draft used for 
first and second circulation, to allow new members of the collaboration to verify
that they have been included correctly. Occasionally a misspelled
name is corrected, or associated institutions become full members.
Therefore an updated author list will be sent to you after the final
EB review of the paper.  In case line numbering doesn't work well
after including the authorlist, try moving the \verb!\bigskip! after
the last author to a separate line.


The authorship for Conference Reports should be ``The LHCb
collaboration'', with a footnote giving the name(s) of the contact
author(s), but without the full list of collaboration names.


The authorship for Figure Reports should be ``The LHCb
collaboration'', with no contact author and without the full list 
of collaboration names.
