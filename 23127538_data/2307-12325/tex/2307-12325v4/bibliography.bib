    abstract = "{Kernel two-sample tests have been widely used for multivariate data to test equality of distributions. However, existing tests based on mapping distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space mainly target specific alternatives and do not work well for some scenarios when the dimension of the data is moderate to high due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a new test statistic that makes use of a common pattern under moderate and high dimensions and achieves substantial power improvements over existing kernel two-sample tests for a wide range of alternatives. We also propose alternative testing procedures that maintain high power with low computational cost, offering easy off-the-shelf tools for large datasets. The new approaches are compared to other state-of-the-art tests under various settings and show good performance. We showcase the new approaches through two applications: the comparison of musks and nonmusks using the shape of molecules, and the comparison of taxi trips starting from John F. Kennedy airport in consecutive months. All proposed methods are implemented in an R package kerTests.}",

Existing works mainly focused on sparse graphs, such as graphs with the number of edges in the order of the number of observations, and their asymptotic results imposed strong conditions on the graph that can easily be violated by commonly constructed graphs they suggested. Moreover, the graph-based tests have better performance with denser graphs under many settings. In this work, we establish the theoretical ground for graph-based tests with graphs ranging from those recommended in current literature to much denser ones.},

abstract = {An important problem in contemporary immunology studies based on single-cell protein expression data is to determine whether cellular expressions are remodeled postinfection by a pathogen. One natural approach for detecting such changes is to use nonparametric two-sample statistical tests. However, in single-cell studies direct application of these tests is often inadequate, because single-cell level expression data from processed uninfected populations often contain attributes of several latent subpopulations with highly heterogeneous characteristics. As a result, viruses often infect these different subpopulations at different rates, in which case the traditional nonparametric two-sample tests for checking similarity in distributions are no longer conservative. In this paper, we propose a new nonparametric method for Testing Remodeling under Heterogeneity (TRUH) that can accurately detect changes in the infected samples compared to possibly heterogeneous uninfected samples. Our testing framework is based on composite nulls and is designed to allow the null model to encompass the possibility that the infected samples, though unaltered by the virus, might be dominantly arising from underrepresented subpopulations in the baseline data. The TRUH statistic, which uses nearest neighbor projections of the infected samples into the baseline uninfected population, is calibrated using a novel bootstrap algorithm. We demonstrate the nonasymptotic performance of the test via simulation experiments and also derive the large sample limit of the test statistic which provides theoretical support toward consistent asymptotic calibration of the test. We use the TRUH statistic for studying remodeling in tonsillar T cells under different types of HIV infection and find that, unlike traditional tests which do not have any heterogeneity correction, TRUH based statistical inference conforms to the biologically validated immunological theories on HIV infection.},

    abstract = { Nonparametric two-sample testing is a classical problem in inferential statistics. While modern two-sample tests, such as the edge count test and its variants, can handle multivariate and non-Euclidean data, contemporary gargantuan datasets often exhibit heterogeneity due to the presence of latent subpopulations. Direct application of these tests, without regulating for such heterogeneity, may lead to incorrect statistical decisions. We develop a new nonparametric testing procedure that accurately detects differences between the two samples in the presence of unknown heterogeneity in the data generation process. Our framework handles this latent heterogeneity through a composite null that entertains the possibility that the two samples arise from a mixture distribution with identical component distributions but with possibly different mixing weights. In this regime, we study the asymptotic behavior of weighted edge count test statistic and show that it can be effectively re-calibrated to detect arbitrary deviations from the composite null. For practical implementation we propose a Bootstrapped Weighted Edge Count test which involves a bootstrap-based calibration procedure that can be easily implemented across a wide range of heterogeneous regimes. A comprehensive simulation study and an application to detecting aberrant user behaviors in online games demonstrates the excellent non-asymptotic performance of the proposed test.
