\abstract{Zigzag nanoribbons hosting the Haldane Chern insulator model are considered. In this context, an unreported reentrant topological phase, characterized by the emergence of quasi zero dimensional in-gap states, is discussed. The bound states, which reside in the gap opened by the hybridization of the counter-propagating edge modes of the Haldane phase, are localized at the ends of the strip and are found to be robust against on-site disorder. These findings are supported by the behavior of the Zak phase over the parameter space, which exhibits jumps of $\pi$ in correspondence to the phase transitions between the trivial and the non-trivial phases. Setups with non-uniform parameters also show topological bound states via the Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism. All the properties reported are shown to be extremely sensitive to the strip width. }

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}
The discovery of topological insulators and topological superconductors completely revolutionized the usual classification of the phases of matter, shedding light on the fact that the Gizburg-Landau classification was but a partial description~\cite{Zhang_rev_2011}. Starting from the first feasible proposal for a topological insulator \cite{bernevig_2007}, in less than two decades the field has undergone several major breakthroughs, like the classification of topological phases by symmetry classes \cite{ryu_2010}, the discovery of higher order topology~\cite{Neupert_2018} and, very recently, of non-Hermitian topology~\cite{Bergholtz_2021}.

At the same time, as the nanostructuration of topological phases of matter has become possible, a very active branch of research is nowadays related to the study of finite size effects on topological phases~\cite{niu_2008, PhysRevB.92.235407, PhysRevB.98.205129, Claessen_2022, Teemu_2011, Molenkamp_2020, Traverso_2022, Vigliotti_2023, PhysRevB.107.245409}. Indeed, dimensional crossovers between topological phases is a promising way to engineer novel topological systems~\cite{Potter_2010}. In this context, the way has been opened for instance by studies on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), that have revealed that these systems, depending on the nanoribbon width and on the nature of its terminations, can host robust topological bound states~\cite{PhysRevLett.119.076401, Li_2021}.

Taking a step back, even before the first theoretical proposal for a symmetry protected topological insulator was conceived, many topologically non-trivial systems had been object of study, first of all the quantum Hall system~\cite{Klitzing_1980}.
In that context, a milestone for the comprehension of topological phases had been conceived: the Haldane model~\cite{haldane_1988}. Dated back to 1988, it represented the first theoretical proposal for a system realising a quantum anomalous Hall phase and is now regarded as the most famous model for a Chern insulator. Even more importantly, the time reversal doubling of the Haldane model results in the Kane-Mele model which, describing spinful fermions on a honeycomb lattice with strong spin-orbit interaction, is the prototypical model of a time reversal protected topological phase~\cite{Kane-Mele-1_2005, Kane-Mele-2_2005}. Although the Kane-Mele model was originally proposed to describe the electrons in graphene, where the predicted spin Hall phase cannot be observed since spin-orbit coupling is too small to yield a sizable topological gap, it has recently found a direct experimental realization in Bismuthene~\cite{Reis_2017} and is hence receiving renewed attention.

Inspired by the rich research landscape in nanostuctured topological insulators and motivated by the renewed interest in honeycomb-based topological models, in this paper we consider zigzag Haldane nanoribbons and assess the effects of dimensional reduction on the topological phase of the Haldane model. We find that, for thin enough strips, there are multiple regions of the parameter space in which the chiral edge states gap out and, correspondingly, degenerate pairs of quasi zero-dimensional (0D) end-states appear whose energy lies inside the gap. Such regions however are intercalated, through topological quantum phase transitions, to phases without bound states. We hence unveil a complex, width-dependent, reentrant quantum phase diagram, which we characterize by numerically computing a well established indicator for the classification of topological phases in (effectively) one-dimensional systems, that is, the Zak phase~\cite{Zak_1989, Jens_2017}. Moreover, we show that domain walls in the on-site staggered potential distribution can localize quasi 0D bound states. These Jackiw-Rebbi like states~\cite{Jackiw_1976} retain a fractional charge of $\pm \frac{e}{2}$ ($e$ the electron charge) and are found to be robust against the introduction of random on-site disorder. More generally, our results demonstrate that the physics of coupled topological edges can be way richer than what is expected from naive low energy theories.

The paper is organized as follows: In section~\ref{sec:Model} we introduce the model Hamiltonian and the lattice specifications; in section~\ref{sec:Res_and_disc} we present and discuss our results; in section~\ref{sec:Concl} we draw our conclusions. In section~\ref{sec:Methods} we briefly report the methods used in the numerical calculations.

\section{Model}\label{sec:Model}
The Haldane model~\cite{haldane_1988} describes spinless fermions on a honeycomb lattice, pierced by an orthogonal periodic magnetic field and having the full symmetry of the lattice and zero net flux over the unit cell. Time reversal symmetry is broken for the model, so that the transverse Hall conductance can be non-trivially quantized~\cite{bernevig2013topological}. We denote the two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice as $A$ and $B$ and we choose as primitive vectors $\vec{a}_1 = a (1,0) $ and $\vec{a}_2 = a(\frac{1}{2},\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$. Moreover, we place the unit cell origin on the $A$ sites, so that the basis vectors are given by $\vec{\delta}_a = (0,0)$ and $\vec{\delta}_b = a(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}})$. The Hamiltonian is thus given by
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \mathcal{H} &= t_1 (\sum_{l,n} a^\dagger_{ln} b_{ln} + a^\dagger_{ln} b_{l-1n}+a^\dagger_{ln}b_{ln-1})+\text{h.c.}\\
        &+t_2 e^{i\phi} (\sum_{l,n} a_{ln}^\dagger a_{l+1n} + a^\dagger_{ln}a_{l-1n+1}+a^\dagger_{ln}a_{ln-1})+\text{h.c.}\\
        &+t_2 e^{-i\phi} (\sum_{l,n} b_{ln}^\dagger b_{l+1n} + b^\dagger_{ln}b_{l-1n+1}+b^\dagger_{ln}b_{ln-1})+\text{h.c.}\\
        &+m (\sum_{l,n} a^\dagger_{ln}a_{ln}-b^\dagger_{ln}b_{ln}),
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $a_{ln}$ ($b_{ln}$) destroys a fermion at $l\vec{a}_1+n\vec{a}_2+\vec{\delta}_{a(b)}$; $t_1$ and $t_2$ parameterize the intensity of the nearest and next to nearest neighbor hoppings respectively; $\phi$ is a phase accounting for the staggered magnetic flux inside the unit cell and $m$ tunes a term of staggered on-site potential breaking inversion symmetry. In the topological phase, that occurs for $|m/t_2|<3\sqrt{3}\sin\phi$, the bulk bands are gapped and the Chern number~\cite{bernevig2013topological} has a non-trivial value ($c=\pm 1)$~\cite{haldane_1988}.

Correspondingly, in a strip geometry chiral modes localized on opposite edges and with gapless dispersion relation occur, in accordance with the bulk boundary correspondence. This can be explicitly seen by imposing periodic boundary conditions (PBC) in the $\vec{a}_1$ direction and going in $k$-space. For a strip of length $L=Na$, the Fourier transformation is defined as
\begin{align}
    a_{ln}&= \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k} e^{-ikx_{ln}^a}a_n(k) & x_{ln}^a&=la+\frac{n}{2}a, \\
    b_{ln}&= \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k} e^{-ikx_{ln}^b}b_n(k) & x_{ln}^b&=la+\frac{n+1}{2}a,
\end{align}
with the Bloch momenta discretized as $k_j=\dfrac{2\pi}{Na}j, \ j=0,\ldots,N-1$. The Bloch Hamiltonian is found to be of the form (see also \cite{Wang_2008})
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}(k) =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        g(\tilde{k},\phi)+m & 2t_1\cos(\frac{\tilde{k}}{2}) & g(\frac{\tilde{k}}{2},-\phi) & 0 & 0 & 0 &\cdots & 0 \\
        2t_1\cos(\frac{\tilde{k}}{2}) & g(\tilde{k},-\phi)-m & t_1 & g(\frac{\tilde{k}}{2},\phi) & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
        g(\frac{\tilde{k}}{2},-\phi) & t_1 & g(\tilde{k},\phi)+m & 2t_1\cos(\frac{\tilde{k}}{2}) & g(\frac{\tilde{k}}{2},-\phi) & 0 &\cdots & 0 \\
        0& g(\frac{\tilde{k}}{2},\phi) & 2t_1\cos(\frac{\tilde{k}}{2}) & g(\tilde{k},-\phi)-m & t_1 & g(\frac{\tilde{k}}{2},\phi) & \ddots & 0 \\
        \vdots & \ddots & \ddots &  \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \cdots &\vdots
    \end{bmatrix},
    \label{eq:Bloch_matrix}
\end{equation}
with $g(\tilde{k},\phi)=2t_2\cos(\tilde{k}+\phi)$ and $\tilde{k}=ka$.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}\textbf{a} is shown a schematic representation of a strip with zigzag edges, $N_y=60$ sites in the vertical direction, and PBC along the $\vec{a}_1$ direction. In Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}\textbf{b} are reported the corresponding energy bands, obtained via numerical tight-binding diagonalization. Inside the bulk gap are clearly visible the two modes corresponding to the chiral edge states characterizing the topological phase.

It can be expected that by reducing the strip width, the chiral edge states may hybridize because of spatial overlap, giving rise to a gap opening in the edge spectrum. This kind of behavior has indeed been explicitly proven in several contexts~\cite{niu_2008,Ohyama_2011}. In spite of this, an analysis of the topological character of the gapped phases originated by finite size effects is still missing in the context of Chern insulators. In the next section, the results of such a study are presented.

\section{Results and discussion}\label{sec:Res_and_disc}
We start by numerically computing the amplitude of the gap $\Delta$ as a function of the staggered on-site potential $m$. We set the energy scale to $t_1 =1$, and we impose $t_2=0.3$ and $\phi=\pi/2$, so that the topological bulk gap of the Haldane model is maximized. We perform our analysis for the Haldane strip with PBC for the different widths $N_y= 4,6,8,10$. The results are reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:Gap-Zak}.

% Figure environment removed

By comparing the top panels (Fig.~\ref{fig:Gap-Zak}\textbf{a}-\ref{fig:Gap-Zak}\textbf{d}) it appears that the number of gap closings and reopenings grows monotonically with the strip width. This non trivial pattern hints to the fact that a topological phase transition may be associated with the gap closings. Interestingly, for the strips whose number of sites in the vertical direction is given by $N_y=4M+2$, the edge spectrum is gapless for $m=0$: in these cases, despite the wave functions of the chiral modes on opposite edges are brought in close proximity, they do not hybridize with each other. This counterintuitive behavior is proven analytically in the Supplementary Material (SM)~\cite{suppl}.

In order to characterize the topology of the zigzag Haldane strips, we use a well established tool for assessing the topological properties of 1D solids: the Zak phase~\cite{Zak_1989}, \textit{i.e.} the natural open-loop extension of the Berry phase~\cite{Berry_1984} when the parameter space is the Brillouin zone. The Zak phase associated with an isolated band was originally defined in terms of the cell-periodic Bloch functions $\ket{u_k}$ as~\cite{Zak_1989}:
\begin{equation}
    \varphi = i \int_{0}^{2\pi/a}\mathrm{d}k \braket{u_k|\partial_k |u_k}.
\end{equation}
However, the above definition cannot be applied in the present case. Indeed, we are dealing with a multiband system in which the valence bands may cross each other and whose Hamiltonian can only be diagonalized numerically. Thus, we follow the prescription given in~\cite{Resta_1994} for the multi-band case. Given a discretization of the Brillouin zone $k_j=\dfrac{2\pi}{a}\dfrac{j}{N}, \ j \in \{0,\ldots,N-1\}$, for each momentum $k_j$ we compute a basis of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian~\ref{eq:Bloch_matrix} for the occupied bands. The resulting $N_y$-dimensional vectors will be denoted as $\ket{u_{nk_0}},\ldots,\ket{u_{nk_{N-1}}}$, $n$ being the band index. Then we enforce the periodic gauge, by defining~\cite{Resta_1994}
\begin{equation}
    \ket{u_{nk_N}}_\ell=e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{a}t_\ell}\ket{u_{k_0}}_\ell,
\end{equation}
where $\ket{u_{nk_j}}_\ell$ is the $\ell$-th component of the eigenvector $\ket{u_{nk_j}}$ and $t_\ell$ the $x$ position of the $\ell$-th site inside the strip unit cell~\cite{yusufaly2013tight}, whose origin we place on the $A$ site at the bottom edge. The Zak phase for the occupied bands is thus defined as~\cite{Resta_1994, vanderbilt_2018, yusufaly2013tight}
\begin{equation}
    \varphi=-\Im \log \det \prod_{j=0}^{N-1}S(k_{j},k_{j+1}),
\end{equation}
with the overlap matrix $S$ given by~\cite{Resta_1994, vanderbilt_2018, yusufaly2013tight}
\begin{equation}
    S(k_{j},k_{j+1})_{mn}=\braket{u_{mk_j}|u_{nk_{j+1}}}.
\end{equation}
This formula is unaffected by any erratic behavior of the phase randomly appended to the eigenvectors by the numerical diagonalization routine~\cite{vanderbilt_2018}. It must be noted that since the Hamiltonian in Eq.~\ref{eq:Bloch_matrix} is real, the Zak phase can only be $0$ or $\pi$. The values obtained for the Zak phase at different values of $m$ are reported in the bottom panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:Gap-Zak}, below the corresponding plots of the energy gap. We find that the Zak phases jump of $\pi$ at each gap closing, confirming that some kind of topological phase transition actually occurs.

In order to gain any insight about which phase is trivial and which is topological we need to make some more physical considerations. As a matter of fact, the Zak phase itself does not have an absolute meaning~\cite{Jens_2017, Atala2013, cayssol_2021}, since its value depends on the choice of the unit cell origin in real space. However, the difference between the values of the Zak phases in two regions of the parameter space is uniquely defined (modulo $2\pi$).

In the large $m$ limit, the system at half filling is expected to be a trivial insulator: in fact, in this scenario the electrons localize on the sublattice which is lower in energy (depending on the sign of $m$) and the hoppings between sites are suppressed. In view of this, we expect the regions of parameter space characterized by a value of the Zak phase differing by $\pi$ ($0$) from that of the large $m$ limit to be topologically non-trivial (trivial). It is worth pointing out that for $N_y=6$ and $N_y=10$ the limits $m \to \pm \infty$ correspond to different values of the Zak phase. We prove analytically in the SM~\cite{suppl} that this is a general fact for $N_y=4M+2$. In these cases, the comparison of the Zak phases should be made with the $m\to -\infty$ limit for negative values of $m$ and with the $m\to \infty$ limit for positive ones. The phase diagram emerging from this argument is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase-diag}, where for each of the widths considered a star is drawn in every region of the parameter space which is expected to be topologically non-trivial. By virtue of bulk boundary correspondence, quasi 0D bound states should occur when the quasi 1D strips are considered under open boundary conditions (OBC) along the $\vec{a}_1$ direction and the parameters fall inside one of the topological regions depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase-diag}.

To check our predictions we perform numerical diagonalization of the model in an uncompactified geometry along the $\vec{a}_1$ direction and we inspect the low energy spectra in the different regions of the parameter space. The OBC strips are cropped with a rectangular geometry, with the long edges parallel to $\vec{a}_1$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:bound_states}, for each of the widths taken into account, the bands in PBC geometry (Panels \textbf{a} to \textbf{d}) and the corresponding low energy spectra in the OBC case (Panels \textbf{e} to \textbf{h}) are reported. The values of $m$ at which the diagonalization was performed for each strip, were chosen close to the point of the topological regions where the gap was maximum (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:Gap-Zak}\textbf{a}-\ref{fig:Gap-Zak}\textbf{d}). The spectra of the finite size systems present two degenerate eigenvalues located inside the gap. In Panels \textbf{i} to \textbf{n} we report the 1D profile of the probability density distributions corresponding to the eigenvalue n${}^\circ 10$ (marked in orange) of the spectra in Panels \textbf{e} to \textbf{h} respectively as a function of the position, together with insets representing the corresponding unprojected probability densities directly on the strips. From the localization pattern of these states, we conclude that the in-gap doublets characterizing the topological phases depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase-diag} correspond to quasi zero-dimensional bound states exponentially localized at the two ends of the strips. We numerically checked the robustness of these 0D bound states against the introduction of random on-site disorder finding that, though their energy is inevitably slightly shifted, they survive as long as the disorder strength does not become comparable with the gap width (see the SM~\cite{suppl}).

% Figure environment removed

The results just discussed prove that the dimensional reduction of the Haldane model, when operated on a strip with zigzag edges, gives rise to an unreported reentrant topological phase diagram, characterized by the emergence of degenerate doublets of in-gap 0D end states. Interestingly, if we consider a setup of our model in which the staggered mass term $m$ interpolates between two values in adjacent regions of the phase diagram with different Zak phases, we observe the occurrence of a bound state, localized at the transition point and with energy lying inside the gap. Thus, leaning on the results from Jackiw and Rebbi~\cite{Jackiw_1976}, we can conclude that such bound state retains a fractional charge of $\pm \frac{e}{2}$~\cite{Qi_2008, Ziani_2020}. Strikingly, the bound state is present even when the mass $m$ interpolates between two regions that, despite having different Zak phases, do not host bound states against the vacuum (more details in the SM \cite{suppl}).

In Fig.~\ref{fig:jackiw-bs} we report an explicit example for a strip with $N_y=10$ and $L=200a$, in which the on-site staggered potential is set to $\mp 0.3$ for the $A$ and $B$ sites respectively on the left part and to $\pm 0.3$ on the right part (with $m=0$ at the interface to smoothen out the jump). These two regions of the phase diagram are marked with a yellow and red dot respectively in Fig.~\ref{fig:phase-diag}\textbf{d}. All the other parameters of the model are left unchanged. In Panel \textbf{a} is reported a density plot of the on-site potential close to the transition point, where the sign of $m$ switches for the two sublattices. By performing real space numerical diagonalization we obtain the low energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenvectors. The first is shown in Panel \textbf{b}, where an isolated eigenvalue is clearly visible inside the gap: this corresponds to a bound state localized at the point where $m$ switches its sign, as demonstrated by the plot of its probability density in Panel \textbf{c}. From Fig.~\ref{fig:Gap-Zak}\textbf{d}, we see that from $m=-0.3$ to $m=+0.3$ the Zak phase jumps of $\pi$, so that the occurrence of a bound state at the domain wall is actually expected according to our analysis. The emergence of such fractionally charged bound states had never been explicitly proven before in the context of the Haldane model.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:Concl}

In this paper we have studied the role of finite size effects on the Haldane model. We have shown that, in the case of zigzag strip geometry, the chiral edge modes can, as expected, hybridize and develop a gap. Surprisingly, however, such gap can be both trivial or topological in the sense that, in the uncompactified geometry, bound states can be present or absent depending on the value of the trivial mass, even in the topological phase of the Haldane model. In other words, we unveiled a phase diagram which presents a width-dependent reentrant behavior with respect to the tuning of the on-site staggered potential. We have proven that, when present, the bound states are robust against on-site random disorder. Besides, we have shown that they also occur in correspondence of domain walls in the on-site staggered potential and, consequently, that they bear a fractional charge of $\pm\frac{e}{2}$. 
The topological nature of the bound states is witnessed by the behavior of the Zak phase. Indeed, we can hence conclude that the mass associated to the tunneling between the edges competes in a definitely non-trivial fashion with the other masses of the model, generating a rich phenomenology.

The implications of our results are diverse. In the context of two-dimensional topological insulators and Chern insulators they imply, for instance, that the transport properties of setups where constrictions are present might be affected by the presence of zero modes, and hence show resonances. Moreover, given that a similar gap structure also characterizes the 2D Kitaev model~\cite{Potter_2010,Shen_2011} for topological superconductivity, the impact of our results bears also consequences on the field of Majorana zero modes~\cite{Kitaev2001, Albrecht_2016, Mourik_2012} and parafermions~\cite{Fendley_2012, Alicea_2016, calzona_2018}, paving the way to new possibilities for implementing such non-abelian excitations.

\section{Methods}\label{sec:Methods}
The finite size model construction and the numerical diagonalization have been performed using the package Pybinding~\cite{dean_moldovan_2020_4010216}.
The computation of the gaps and of the Zak phase as a function of the staggered on-site potential have been performed with an original code and the results for the Zak phase have been benchmarked with existing packages.
