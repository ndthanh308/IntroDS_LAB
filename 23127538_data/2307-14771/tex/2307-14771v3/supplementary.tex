\section*{Supplementary Notes}
\subsection*{Supplementary Note 1}
Given the Hamiltonian with PBC along the $\mathbf{a}_1$ direction in Eq.~(4) of the main text, the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}(k) \Psi = \epsilon \Psi,
\end{equation}
can be recast in a more explicit way by denoting
\begin{equation}
    \Psi_{2n-1}(k)= \psi_n^A(k), \ \Psi_{2n}(k)= \psi_n^B(k), \qquad n \in \{1,\ldots,N_y/2\}.
\end{equation}
In this notation we can can synthetically write 
\begin{align*}
    \varepsilon\psi_n^A(k) &= \bigg\{g_0\psi_n^B(k)+t_1\psi_{n-1}^B(k)+(g(k,\phi)+m)\psi_n^A(k)+g(k/2,-\phi)\big[\psi_{n+1}^A(k)+\psi_{n-1}^A(k)\big]\bigg\},\\
    \varepsilon\psi_n^B(k) &= \bigg\{g_0\psi_n^A(k)+t_1\psi_{n+1}^A(k)+(g(k,-\phi)-m)\psi_n^B(k)+g(k/2,\phi)\big[\psi_{n+1}^B(k)+\psi_{n-1}^B(k)\big]\bigg\},
\end{align*}
where $g(k,\phi) = 2t_2\cos(k+\phi)$ and $g_0=2t_1\cos(k/2)$. The above equations are to be read assuming that $\psi_{0}^{A/B}(k)=0=\psi_{\Tilde{N}+1}^{A/B}(k), \ \Tilde{N}=N_y/2$, because of open boundary conditions in the $y$ direction. With $\phi = \pi/2$ we get: $g(k,\pm \pi/2) = \mp 2t_2\sin(k)$. Thus, after renormalizing every constant in units of $t_1$, we have
{\small
\begin{align*}
    \varepsilon\psi_n^A(k) &= \bigg\{2\cos(k/2)\psi_n^B(k)+\psi_{n-1}^B(k)+(-2t_2\sin(k)+m)\psi_n^A(k)+2t_2\sin(k/2)\big[\psi_{n+1}^A(k)+\psi_{n-1}^A(k)\big]\bigg\},\\
    \varepsilon\psi_n^B(k) &= \bigg\{2\cos(k/2)\psi_n^A(k)+\psi_{n+1}^A(k)+(2t_2\sin(k)-m)\psi_n^B(k)-2t_2\sin(k/2)\big[\psi_{n+1}^B(k)+\psi_{n-1}^B(k)\big]\bigg\}.
\end{align*}
}
What we want to prove here is that for $\Tilde{N}=2M+1$ (\textit{i.e.} $N_y=4M+2$), $M\in \mathbb N$, and $m=0$, the dispersion relation is always metallic. By setting $k=\pi$ we get:
\begin{align*}
    \varepsilon\psi_n^A(\pi) &= \bigg\{\psi_{n-1}^B(\pi)+2t_2\big[\psi_{n+1}^A(\pi)+\psi_{n-1}^A(\pi)\big]\bigg\},\\
    \varepsilon\psi_n^B(\pi) &= \bigg\{\psi_{n+1}^A(\pi)-2t_2\big[\psi_{n+1}^B(\pi)+\psi_{n-1}^B(\pi)\big]\bigg\}.
\end{align*}
We now start looking for a zero energy solution. Enforcing $\varepsilon=0$, the above equations reduce to
\begin{align*}
    0&= \psi_{n-1}^B+2t_2\big[\psi_{n+1}^A+\psi_{n-1}^A\big],\\
    0 &= \psi_{n+1}^A-2t_2\big[\psi_{n+1}^B+\psi_{n-1}^B\big],
\end{align*}
where, to simplify the notation, we have omitted the fact that the $\psi_n^{A/B}(k)$ are calculated for $k=\pi$.

Imposing the boundary condition $\psi_{0}^{A/B}(k)=0$ we get
\begin{align*}
    0 &= 2t_2\psi_{2}^A,\\
    0 &= \psi_{2}^A-2t_2\psi_{2}^B, \\
    0 &= \psi_{1}^B+2t_2\big[\psi_{3}^A+\psi_{1}^A\big],\\
    0 &= \psi_{3}^A-2t_2\big[\psi_{3}^B+\psi_{1}^B\big],
    \\
    &\vdots
\end{align*}
so that in the end $\psi_{2\ell}^{A/B}=0$ for any $\ell \in \mathbb N$. On the other hand, the boundary condition $\psi_{\Tilde{N}+1}^{A/B}(k)=0$ imposes no more conditions if $\Tilde{N}=2M+1$, since then $\Tilde{N}+1$ is even, while for $\Tilde{N}=2M$ it forces $\psi_{2\ell+1}^{A/B}=0$ for any $\ell \in \mathbb N$ as well. Thus we conclude that if $N_y=4M$ no zero energy solution exists for $m=0$. Note that the dispersion relation can only be gapless at $k=\pi$, since that is the position of the Dirac point for the edge states of the Haldane model on a strip with zigzag edges (see Fig.~1\textbf{b} of the main text).

For the $\Tilde{N}=2M+1$ case we look for a solution of the following kind:
\begin{align*}
    \psi_{2\ell}^{A/B} &=0, \\
    \psi_{2\ell+1}^{A/B} &= \xi^\ell \psi_{1}^{A/B}.
\end{align*}
The first condition is coherent with the boundary conditions, as already discussed. About the second one, by substituting $n=2\ell$ into the equations one gets
\begin{align*}
    0&= \psi_{2\ell-1}^B+2t_2\big[\psi_{2\ell+1}^A+\psi_{2\ell-1}^A\big]=\xi^{\ell-1}\psi_{1}^B+2t_2\big[\xi^{\ell}\psi_{1}^A+\xi^{\ell-1}\psi_{1}^A\big],\\
    0 &= \psi_{2\ell+1}^A-2t_2\big[\psi_{2\ell+1}^B+\psi_{2\ell-1}^B\big]=\xi^{\ell}\psi_{1}^A-2t_2\big[\xi^{\ell}\psi_{1}^B+\xi^{\ell-1}\psi_{1}^B\big],
\end{align*}
which upon dividing by $\xi^{\ell-1}$ yield
\begin{align*}
    0&=\psi_{1}^B+2t_2\big[\xi\psi_{1}^A+\psi_{1}^A\big],\\
    0 &= \xi\psi_{1}^A-2t_2\big[\xi\psi_{1}^B+\psi_{1}^B\big].
\end{align*}
Solving the system we get
\begin{equation}
    \psi_1^B=\dfrac{\xi}{2t_2(1+\xi)}\psi_1^A \implies \dfrac{\xi}{2t_2(1+\xi)}+2t_2(1+\xi)=0 \implies \xi + 4t_2^2(1+\xi)^2=0.
\end{equation}
Solving the equation for $\xi$ we get:
\begin{equation}
    \xi^2 + \xi (1/(4t_2^2) + 2) + 1 = 0 \implies \xi_{\pm} = - (1/(8t_2^2) + 1) \pm \sqrt{(1/(8t_2^2) + 1)^2-1}.
\end{equation}
Thus, we find two solutions with zero energy at $k=\pi$ for $m=0$ in the $N_y=4M+2$ case, as claimed in the main text. Finally, we observe that the product of the solutions is $1$, meaning that they have the same sign, and their sum equals $-(1/(4t_2^2) + 2)$,  meaning that they are both negative, one bigger and one smaller then unity in modulus respectively. These two degenerate solutions correspond to a state localized on the upper edge and to a state localized on the lower one, as expected.

\subsection*{Supplementary Note 2}
Let $N_y$ be the number of sites in the vertical direction (or, equivalently in the $\vec{a}_2$ direction).
In the large $m$ limit ($m\gg t_1,t_2$), the Hamiltonian can be brutally approximated as 
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}(k)= \mathrm{diag}(m,-m,m,-m,\ldots).
\end{equation}
If the system is at half filling, the occupied states will be those localized on the sublattice with negative value of the on-site potential, \textit{i.e.} the $B$ sublattice for $m>0$ and the $A$ sublattice for $m<0$.

Let us start by considering $m>0$. For each $k \in \{0,\frac{2\pi}{Na}, \ldots,\frac{2\pi}{Na}(N-1)\}$ a basis of eigenstates for the $N_y/2\ (\equiv \Bar{n})$  occupied bands is given by
\begin{equation}
    \Psi^{m>0}_{1_\ell}(k) = \delta_{2,\ell},\ \ldots, \ \Psi^{m>0}_{\Bar{n}_\ell}(k) = \delta_{2\Bar{n},\ell}, \qquad \ell \in 1,\ldots,N_y,
\end{equation}
where the $\Psi_n(k)$ are $N_y$-dimensional vectors and the index $\ell$ refers to their components.
Thus, for $j=0,\ldots, N-2$, the $S$ matrix is trivially given by
\begin{equation}
    S^{m>0}(k_j,k_{j+1})= \mathbb I_{\Bar{n}},
\end{equation}
so that $\det[S^{m>0}(k_j,k_{j+1})]=+1 \ \forall j \in \{0,\ldots, N-2\}$.
However, from the periodic gauge enforcing,
\begin{equation}
    \Psi^{m>0}_{n_\ell}(k_N) = \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\frac{2\pi}{a}t_\ell}  \Psi^{m>0}_{n_\ell}(k_0),
\end{equation}
where $t_\ell$ is the $x$-position of the $\ell$-th site in the strip unit cell. With our conventions (see main text) we get
\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\frac{2\pi}{a}t_{4r}} &= 1, \\
    \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\frac{2\pi}{a}t_{4r+1}} &= 1, \\
    \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\frac{2\pi}{a}t_{4r+2}} &= -1, \\
    \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}\frac{2\pi}{a}t_{4r+3}} &= -1.
\end{align*}
Thus, for $m>0$ we get
\begin{align*}
    \Psi^{m>0}_{2n_\ell}(k_N) &= \delta_{4n,\ell}, \\
    \Psi^{m>0}_{{2n-1}_\ell}(k_N) &= -\delta_{4n-2,\ell},
\end{align*}
or, equivalently
\begin{equation}
    \Psi^{m>0}_{n_\ell}(k_N) = (-1)^n \delta_{2n,\ell}.
\end{equation}
Recalling that at half filling $N_y=2\Bar{n}$, we have
\begin{equation}
    [S^{m>0}(k_{N-1},k_{N})]_{rs}= \Psi^{m>0\dagger}_r(k_{N-1})\Psi^{m>0}_s(k_N) = (-1)^s \sum_{\ell=1}^{N_y}\delta_{2r,\ell}\delta_{\ell, 2s}= (-1)^{r}\delta_{rs},
\end{equation}
and therefore the determinant turns out to depend on the value of $\Bar{n}$
\begin{equation}
    \det[S^{m>0}(k_{N-1},k_{N})]= 
    \begin{cases}
        +1 &\Bar{n}= 4\ell \\
        -1 &\Bar{n} = 4\ell +1 \\
        -1 &\Bar{n} = 4\ell +2 \\
        +1 &\Bar{n} = 4\ell + 3 \\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

We now turn to the $m<0$ case.
For each $k \in \{0,\frac{2\pi}{Na}, \ldots,\frac{2\pi}{Na}(N-1)\}$ a basis of eigenstates of the the $N_y/2\ (\equiv \Bar{n})$ occupied bands is now given by
\begin{equation}
    \Psi^{m<0}_{1_\ell}(k) = \delta_{1,\ell},\ \ldots, \ \Psi^{m<0}_{\Bar{n}_\ell}(k) = \delta_{2\Bar{n}-1,\ell}, \qquad \ell \in 1,\ldots,N_y.
\end{equation}
Again for $j=0,\ldots, N-2$, the $S$ matrix is trivially given by
\begin{equation}
    S^{m<0}(k_j,k_{j+1})= \mathbb I_{\Bar{n}},
\end{equation}
so that $\det[S^{m<0}(k_j,k_{j+1})]=+1 \ \forall j \in \{0,\ldots, N-2\}$. However, enforcing the periodic gauge for $m<0$ yields ($\Psi^{m<0}_{n_\ell}(k)=\delta_{2n-1,\ell}$)
\begin{align*}
    \Psi^{m<0}_{2n_\ell}(k_N) &= -\delta_{4n-1,\ell}, \\
    \Psi^{m<0}_{{2n-1}_\ell}(k_N) &= +\delta_{4n-3,\ell},
\end{align*}
or, equivalently
\begin{equation}
    \Psi^{m<0}_{n_\ell}(k_N) = (-1)^{n-1} \delta_{2n-1,\ell}.
\end{equation}
Then, proceeding as in the $m>0$ case
\begin{equation}
    [S^{m<0}(k_{N-1},k_{N})]_{rs} = (-1)^{r-1}\delta_{rs} \implies \det[S(k_{N-1},k_{N})]= 
    \begin{cases}
        +1 &\Bar{n}= 4\ell \\
        +1 &\Bar{n} = 4\ell +1 \\
        -1 &\Bar{n} = 4\ell +2 \\
        -1 &\Bar{n} = 4\ell + 3 \\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

We have found that in the large $m$ limit the sign of  $\prod_{j=0}^{N-1} \det[S(k_{j},k_{j+1})] $ is entirely determined by the sign of $\det[S(k_{N-1},k_{N})]$. Knowing that, we can easily determine the Zak phase, which is given by
\[
    \varphi = -\Im \log \prod_{j=0}^{N-1} \det[S(k_{j},k_{j+1})], \qquad \varphi \in (-\pi,\pi].
\]
The resulting values of the Zak phase in the large (positive and negative) $m$ limit are reported as a function of $N_y$ ($N_{y}=2\Bar{n}$) in Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:tab1}. In particular, by inspecting Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:tab1} we conclude that for $N_y=4M+2$ the Zak phase differs of $\pi$ between the $m\to \pm \infty$ limits, while this is not the case for $N_y=4M$.

\subsection*{Supplementary Note 3}
In order to test the robustness of the bound states, we assess their stability against the introduction of random on-site disorder of the following form
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}_\text{RN} = \sum_{i} \omega_i c_i^\dagger c_i,
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over all lattice sites, the operator $c_i$ destroys a fermion at site $i$ and $\omega_i$ is a real number randomly extracted from the interval $[-V,V]$, $V>0$. In Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_2} we compare two Haldane zigzag nanoribbons (OBC geometry) with $N_y=4$ and $L=20a$ without (Panels \textbf{a}, \textbf{c}, \textbf{e}, \textbf{g}) and with (Panels \textbf{b}, \textbf{d}, \textbf{f}, \textbf{h}) disorder respectively; an analogous comparison for a strip with $N_y=6$ and $L=40a$ is reported in Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_3}. The parameters of the Haldane model are set as in the main text to $t_1=1, \ t_2=0.3, \ \phi=\frac{\pi}{2}$, while the maximum intensity of the on-site disorder is chosen as $V=0.2$. The mass term is set to $m=0$ for the $N_y=4$ strip and to $m=0.5$ for the $N_y=6$ one, so that both systems are in their topological phase and host end states.

For both configurations, we find that the effect of the random on-site disorder is to break the degeneracy between the end states, which, however, survive to the perturbation.
In Panels \textbf{a} and \textbf{b} of Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_2} (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_3}) we report a graphical representation of the on-site potential in absence and presence of the random noise term for the strip with $N_y=4$ ($N_y=6$). In Panels \textbf{c} and \textbf{d} of Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_2} (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_3}) we compare the corresponding low energy spectra: even in the presence of noise, two eigenmodes (marked in red and orange) are present inside the energy gap. However, in contrast to the unperturbed case, the in-gap eigenvalues in Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_2}\textbf{d} (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_3}\textbf{d}) are slightly split in energy. In Panels \textbf{e} and \textbf{g} of Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_2} (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_3}) are reported the probability density plots of the eigenstates corresponding to the eigenvalues marked in red and orange in Panel \textbf{c}, while in Panels \textbf{f} and \textbf{h} of Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_2} (Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:noise_N_3}) are reported the ones corresponding to the eigenvalues marked in red and orange in Panel \textbf{d}. By comparing them one can see that, as a consequence of the energy splitting, the two bound states, which in absence of noise are degenerate in energy and equally localized on both ends, localize themselves on one end of the strip each.

Similar results to those discussed here hold for strips of greater width or different random noise configurations. However, being that the splitting between the end states is due to the value of the on-site disorder at the two ends of the strip (\textit{i.e.} where the bound states are localized), the splitting of the eigenmodes (and so their localization pattern) may differ for different noise configurations.

\subsection*{Supplementary Note 4}
To derive an effective analytical expression for the coupling term $\mathcal{M}$ in Eq.~9 of the main text in the case $m=0$, we start by considering the coupling between two one dimensional chains, formed by the edge sites of the zigzag nanoribbon. We introduce an exponentially suppressed coupling between the two chains, of the form
\[
    t_{ij} = \mathrm{e}^{-d_{ij}/\xi},
\]
with $d_{ij}$ the distance between the site $i$ of one edge and the site $j$ of the other and $\xi$ some length scale.

Also, we set a sharp ``first-neighbor'' cutoff, effectively limiting the interaction to the edge sites that in the full strip are connected by the minimum amount of first neighbor hoppings (see Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:eff_coupl_scheme}). According to this criterion, the number of coordination is easily found to be $n_c = \frac{N_y}{2}+1$. Thus, the interaction Hamiltonian is written as
\begin{align*}
    &N_y=4M: && H_{\text{int}} = \Tilde{\Delta}\sum_{\ell=1}^{N}\sum_{j=-(n_c-1)/2}^{(n_c-1)/2} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(ja)^2}-w)/\xi} a^\dagger_\ell b_{\ell+j} + \text{h.c.}, \\
    &N_y=4M+2: && H_{\text{int}} = \Tilde{\Delta}\sum_{\ell =1}^{N}\sum_{j=-n_c/2}^{n_c/2-1} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(ja+a/2)^2}-w)/\xi} a^\dagger_\ell b_{\ell+j} +\text{h.c.},
\end{align*}
where $\Tilde{\Delta}$ is some arbitrary energy scale and $w$ the strip width. The operator $a_\ell$ ($b_\ell$) destroys a fermion on the site $\ell $ of the lower (upper) edge, corresponding to a $A$ ($B$) site.
The strip width $w$ can be expressed in terms of $N_y$ as (first neighbor distance set to unity)
\[
    w = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\dfrac{N_y}{2}-\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
About the length scale $\xi$, it is reasonable to assume that it should be of the same order of magnitude of the localization length of the edge states. This is given analytically for $k=\pi$ (assuming $m=0$ and $\phi=\frac{\pi}{2}$) in~\cite{Doh_2013, Cano_2013}
\[
    \xi_{\text{loc}}(\pi) = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\left[\log\left\{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{t_1}{4t_2}\right)^2} +\frac{t_1}{4t_2}\right\}\right]^{-1},
\]
and is shown to be more or less constant around the Dirac point and for small values of $m$. More specifically, since the coupling results from the interaction between the two opposite chiral modes, each of which has a decay length $\sim\xi_{\text{loc}}(\pi)$, we pick $\xi=2\xi_{\text{loc}}(\pi)$ for the plots in Figs.~5\textbf{a} to 5\textbf{d} of the main text.

By Fourier transforming we find the interacting Hamiltonian in $k$-space. First we rewrite expressing $n_c$ in terms of $M$:
\begin{align*}
    &N_y=4M: && H_{\text{int}} = \Tilde{\Delta}\sum_{\ell =1}^{N}\sum_{j=-M}^{M} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(ja)^2}-w)/\xi} a^\dagger_\ell b_{\ell +j} + \text{h.c.}, \\
    &N_y=4M+2: && H_{\text{int}} = \Tilde{\Delta}\sum_{\ell =1}^{N}\sum_{j=-(M+1)}^{M} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(ja+a/2)^2}-w)/\xi} a^\dagger_\ell b_{\ell+j} +\text{h.c.}
\end{align*}
The Fourier transformation is defined as
\begin{align}
    a_{\ell}&= \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}k\ell a}a(k), \\
    b_{\ell}&= \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}k(\ell a+\delta)}b(k) ,
\end{align}
with $\delta = 0$ if $N_y=4M$ and $\delta = 1/2$ if $N_y=4M+2$. Thus
\begin{align*}
    &N_y=4M: && H_{\text{int}} = \frac{\Tilde{\Delta}}{N}\sum_{\ell=1}^{N} \sum_{k,q}\sum_{j=-M}^{M} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+j^2}-w)/\xi} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}k\ell}\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}q(\ell+j)}a^\dagger(k)b(q) + \text{h.c.} \\
    &N_y=4M+2: && H_{\text{int}} = \frac{\Tilde{\Delta}}{N}\sum_{\ell=1}^{N}\sum_{k,q}\sum_{j=-(M+1)}^{M} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(j+1/2)^2}-w)/\xi} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}k\ell}\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}q(\ell+j+1/2)} a^\dagger(k)b(q)+\text{h.c.}
\end{align*}
Summing over $\ell$ and $q$:
\begin{align*}
    &N_y=4M: && H_{\text{int}} = \Tilde{\Delta}\sum_{k}\sum_{j=-M}^{M} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+j^2}-w)/\xi} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}kj}a^\dagger(k)b(k) + \text{h.c.} \\
    &N_y=4M+2: && H_{\text{int}} = \Tilde{\Delta}\sum_{k}\sum_{j=-(M+1)}^{M} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(j+1/2)^2}-w)/\xi} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}k(j+1/2)} a^\dagger(k)b(k) +\text{h.c.}
\end{align*}
Now we consider the $N_y=4M$ case first. We have
\[
    H_{\text{int}} = \Tilde{\Delta}\sum_{k} [1 + \sum_{j=1}^{M} 2\cos(kj)\mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+j^2}-w)/\xi}]a^\dagger(k)b(k) + \text{h.c.},
\]
yielding
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}^{\text{edge}}_{\text{int}}(k)= \Tilde{\Delta} [1 + \sum_{j=1}^{M} 2\cos(kj)\mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+j^2}-w)/\xi}] \tau_x.
\end{equation}
Proceeding analogously for the $N_y=4M+2$ case
\[
    \begin{split}
        H_{\text{int}} &=\Tilde{\Delta}\sum_{k}\left\{\sum_{j=0}^{M} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(j+1/2)^2}-w)/\xi} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}k(j+1/2)} a^\dagger(k)b(k) +\text{h.c.} \right.\\
        &\left.+ \sum_{j=1}^{M+1} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(-j+1/2)^2}-w)/\xi} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}k(-j+1/2)} a^\dagger(k)b(k) +\text{h.c.}\right\}\\
        &= \Tilde{\Delta}\sum_{k}\left\{\sum_{j=0}^{M} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(j+1/2)^2}-w)/\xi} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i}k(j+1/2)} a^\dagger(k)b(k) +\text{h.c.} \right.\\
        &\left.+ \sum_{j=0}^{M} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(j+1/2)^2}-w)/\xi} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}k(j+1/2)} a^\dagger(k)b(k) +\text{h.c.}\right\}\\
        &= \Tilde{\Delta}\sum_{k}\sum_{j=0}^{M} \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(j+1/2)^2}-w)/\xi} 2\cos(k(j+1/2)) a^\dagger(k)b(k) +\text{h.c.} \\
    \end{split}
\]
This yields
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}^{\text{edge}}_{\text{int}}(k)= \Tilde{\Delta} \sum_{j=0}^{M} 2\cos(k(j+1/2)) \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(j+1/2)^2}-w)/\xi}  \tau_x.
\end{equation}
Thus, if we identify $\mathcal{H}^{\text{edge}}_{\text{int}}(k)= \mathcal{M}^{\text{teo}}(k)\tau_x$ in the end we have
\begin{align}
    &N_y=4M: && \mathcal{M}^{\text{teo}}(k) = \Tilde{\Delta} [1 + \sum_{j=1}^{M} 2\cos(kj)\mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+j^2}-w)/\xi}],
    \label{eq:delta_even}
    \\
    &N_y=4M+2: && \mathcal{M}^{\text{teo}}(k) = \Tilde{\Delta} \sum_{j=0}^{M} 2\cos(k(j+1/2)) \mathrm{e}^{-(\sqrt{w^2+(j+1/2)^2}-w)/\xi}.
    \label{eq:delta_odd}
\end{align}

Moreover, as explained in the main text, we can numerically retrieve the mass term $\mathcal{M}$ as a function of the model parameters for a given $N_y$ via
\begin{equation}
    |\mathcal{M}(m;k)|= \sqrt{E_{N_y}(m; k)^2-E_{\infty}(m; k)^2},
    \label{eq:mass_num}
\end{equation}
where $E_{N_y}(m; k)$ is the-- exact, numerically computed --lowest positive energy band for a strip of width $N_y$ (all the other parameters of the model fixed), and $E_{\infty}(m; k)$ is the lowest positive energy band for a model with the same identical parameters but, on a much wider strip ($N_y\to \infty)$.

In Supplementary Figures~\ref{fig:Mk_t2_015-num}, \ref{fig:Mk_t2_02-num} and \ref{fig:Mk_t2_03-num} are shown the plots of $\mathcal{M}$ as a function of $k$ and for different values of the staggered mass $m$-- each column corresponding to one of the widths considered in the main text ($N_y=4,6,8,10$) --for $t_2=0.15$, $t_2=0.2$ and $t_2=0.3$ respectively. The reference spectrum ($E_{\infty}(m; k)$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:mass_num}) was obtained considering a strip with $N_y =202$ sites in the vertical direction.

The general features that we can retrieve from these plots are the following: The number of nodes in the effective mass increases of exactly one from one zigzag strip to the next larger one; for $m=0$ the effective mass has a node at $\pi$ when $N_y=4M+2, \ M \in \mathbb{Z}$; as $m$ is increased (to positive values) the profile of $\mathcal{M}$ moves to the right in the Brillouin zone; the higher the value of $t_2$ the more the profile of $\mathcal{M}$ spreads in $k$-space. The points in $k$ space where $\mathcal{M}$ stops oscillating and steeply goes up correspond to the points where the edge states of the wide (reference) strip merge with the bulk states. That is, where the low energy theory ceases to work.

\subsection*{Supplementary Note 5}
Here we report some more phenomenology regarding the Jackiw-Rebbi like bound states occurring at the interface between sides of the strip belonging to topologically distinct regions of the phase diagram. We set the parameters as in the main text to $t_1=1, \ t_2=0.3, \ \phi=\frac{\pi}{2}$.
In the main text we considered a scenario with $N_y=6$ and with $m$ interpolating between two regions of the phase diagram both trivial with respect to the presence of end states, but with the Zak phase differing of $\pi$. Here we consider a more detailed, though necessarily not exhaustive, phenomenology.

In Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:VarPot_N_4-M_-0.3_0.3} we consider a zigzag Haldane nanoribbon with $N_y=4$ and $L=40a$, with the staggered on-site potential $m$ interpolating between $-0.3$ and $0.3$ (Panel \textbf{a}). With reference to the phase diagram in Fig.~2\textbf{a} of the main text, the two sides of the strip belong to the same region of the phase diagram: Therefore, no bound states at the domain wall would be expected. Indeed, from numerical diagonalization we find that two isolated degenerate eigenvalues occur inside the gap (Panel \textbf{b}). These correspond to two bound states which, according to the probability density plots in Panels \textbf{c}, \textbf{d}, are equally localized on the two ends of the strip. These are actually expected since both sides of the strip are in the topologically non trivial region (cf. Fig.~2\textbf{a} of the main text).



In Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:VarPot_N_6-M_0.5_1.3} we consider a zigzag Haldane nanoribbon with $N_y=6$ and $L=80a$, with the staggered on-site potential $m$ interpolating between $0.5$ and $1.3$ (Panel \textbf{a}). With reference to the phase diagram in Fig.~2\textbf{b} of the main text, the two sides of the strip belong to distinct contiguous regions of the phase diagram: in terms of end states $m=0.5$ belongs to the topologically non-trivial region, while $m=1.3$ to the trivial (and connected to the atomic limit) one. Since the Zak phase differs of $\pi$ between the two regions, a bound state is expected at the domain wall. The low energy spectrum obtained via numerical diagonalization is reported in Panel \textbf{b}. We find that two isolated eigenvalues occur inside the gap: The lower one in energy (coloured in red) corresponds to an eigenstate localized at the domain wall in the on-site potential, as shown by the probability density plot in Panel \textbf{c}. The one at higher energy instead (coloured in orange), is localized at the left end of the strip (Panel \textbf{d}): this is expected since the left side, having $m=0.5$, pertain to a topological region (cf. Fig.~2\textbf{b} of the main text).

In Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:VarPot_N_6-M_-0.5_0.5} we consider a zigzag Haldane nanoribbon with $N_y=6$ and $L=80a$, with the staggered on-site potential $m$ interpolating between $-0.5$ and $0.5$ (Panel \textbf{a}). With reference to the phase diagram in Fig.~2\textbf{b} of the main text, the two sides of the strip belong to distinct contiguous regions of the phase diagram: in terms of end states, both sides belong to topologically non trivial regions of the phase diagrams. Despite this, since the Zak phase differs of $\pi$ between the two regions, a bound state is expected at the domain wall (similarly to the case considered in the main text). The low energy spectrum obtained via numerical diagonalization is reported in Panel \textbf{b}. We find that three isolated eigenvalues occur inside the gap: The mid one in energy (coloured in red) corresponds to an eigenstate localized at the domain wall in the on-site potential, as shown by the probability density plot in Panel \textbf{c}. The one at higher energy instead (coloured in orange), is localized at the right end of the strip (Panel \textbf{d}). Finally, the lower one in energy correspond to an eigenstate localized at the left end of the strip (the corresponding probability density plot is not reported for brevity). Again, these latter two bound states are expected, since the right (left) side, having $m=0.5$ ($m=-0.5$), pertain to a topological region (cf. Fig.~2\textbf{b} of the main text).
