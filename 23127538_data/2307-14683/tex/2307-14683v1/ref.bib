A few typical lattice models of rings are proposed. Besides pattern formation and turbulencelike behavior, our ring models, as statistical cooperative systems, can exhibit curious phase transitions with the order parameter essentially of dynamic origin. Finally, such fields of rings are generalized in order to simulate excitable media, and also to incorporate equilibrium cooperative fields of some known universality classes.}",

  abstract={ Although there has been considerable progress in the development of engineering principles for synthetic biology, a substantial challenge is the construction of robust circuits in a noisy cellular environment. Such an environment leads to considerable intercellular variability in circuit behaviour, which can hinder functionality at the colony level. Here we engineer the synchronization of thousands of oscillating colony ‘biopixels’ over centimetre-length scales through the use of synergistic intercellular coupling involving quorum sensing within a colony and gas-phase redox signalling between colonies. We use this platform to construct a liquid crystal display (LCD)-like macroscopic clock that can be used to sense arsenic via modulation of the oscillatory period. Given the repertoire of sensing capabilities of bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the ability to coordinate their behaviour over large length scales sets the stage for the construction of low cost genetic biosensors that are capable of detecting heavy metals and pathogens in the field.},

We now test the hypothesis that the circadian period in behavior is determined by the mean period that arises from the coupling of clock cells with diverse circadian periods. For these studies, we monitored firing rate rhythms of individual suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons on fixed multielectrode plates and exploited the altered circadian periods expressed by heterozygous and homozygous tau mutant hamsters. The results show that circadian period in the whole animal is determined by averaging widely dispersed periods of individual clock cells. The data also demonstrate that the tau mutation affects circadian function in a cell-autonomous manner.}

abstract = {In this paper, the global asymptotic and exponential stability are investigated for a class of neural networks with both the discrete and distributed time-varying delays. By using appropriate Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, several delay-dependent sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the global asymptotic and exponential stability of the addressed neural networks. These conditions are expressed in terms of LMIs, and are dependent on both the discrete and distributed time delays. Therefore, the stability of the neural networks can be checked readily by resorting to the Matlab LMI toolbox. In addition, the proposed stability criteria do not require the monotonicity of the activation functions and the differentiability of the discrete and distributed time-varying delays, which means that our results generalize and further improve those in the earlier publications. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness and less conservatism of the obtained conditions.}
