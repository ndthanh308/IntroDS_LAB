  "abstract": "The effect of phase-lag parameter in pairwise interactions has been a topic of great interest for long. However, real-world systems often have interactions that are beyond pairwise and can be modeled using simplicial complexes. We investigate the effect of the inclusion of phase-lag in coupled Kuramoto oscillators with simplicial interactions and find that it shifts the critical points at which first-order transition from cluster synchronized state to incoherent state occurs. In the thermodynamic limit, using the Ott-Antonsen approach we derive a reduced equation for order parameter measuring cluster synchronization. Further, we progress through the self-consistency method to achieve a closed form of the order parameter measuring global synchronization which was lacking in Ott-Antonsen approach. Moreover, considering polar coordinates framework we obtain rotation frequency of the clusters which comes out to be a function of the phase-lag parameter further indicating that phase-lag can be used as a control parameter to achieve a desired cluster frequency.",
