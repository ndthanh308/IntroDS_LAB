	abstract = {Continuously monitored atomic spin-ensembles allow, in principle, for real-time sensing of external magnetic fields beyond classical limits. Within the linear-Gaussian regime, thanks to the phenomenon of measurement-induced spin-squeezing, they attain a quantum-enhanced scaling of sensitivity both as a function of time, t, and the number of atoms involved, N. In our work, we rigorously study how such conclusions based on Kalman filtering methods change when inevitable imperfections are taken into account: in the form of collective noise, as well as stochastic fluctuations of the field in time. We prove that even an infinitesimal amount of noise disallows the error to be arbitrarily diminished by simply increasing N, and forces it to eventually follow a classical-like behaviour in t. However, we also demonstrate that, `thanks' to the presence of noise, in most regimes the model based on a homodyne-like continuous measurement actually achieves the ultimate sensitivity allowed by the decoherence, yielding then the optimal quantum-enhancement. We are able to do so by constructing a noise-induced lower bound on the error that stems from a general method of classically simulating a noisy quantum evolution, during which the stochastic parameter to be estimated---here, the magnetic field---is encoded. The method naturally extends to schemes beyond the linear-Gaussian regime, in particular, also to ones involving feedback or active control.},

However, studies in recent years have revealed wide connections between QFIM and other aspects of quantum mechanics, including quantum thermodynamics, quantum phase transition, entanglement witness, quantum speed limit and non-Markovianity. These connections indicate that QFIM is more than a concept in quantum metrology, but rather a fundamental quantity in quantum mechanics. In this paper, we summarize the properties and existing calculation techniques of QFIM for various cases, and review the development of QFIM in some aspects of quantum mechanics apart from quantum metrology. On the other hand, as the main application of QFIM, the second part of this paper reviews the quantum multiparameter Cramér–Rao bound, its attainability condition and the associated optimal measurements. Moreover, recent developments in a few typical scenarios of quantum multiparameter estimation and the quantum advantages are also thoroughly discussed in this part.}

A magnetic or electric field induces a spatially varying stress across the sensor, which then induces a force on mechanical eigenmodes of the system. The force on each oscillator can then be determined from an overlap integral between magnetostrictive stress and the corresponding eigenmode, with the optomechanical coupling strength determining the ultimate resolution with which this force can be detected. Furthermore, an optomechanical magnetic field sensor is compared to other magnetic field sensors in terms of sensitivity and potential for miniaturization. It is shown that an optomechanical sensor can potentially outperform state-of-the-art magnetometers of similar size, in particular other sensors based on a magnetostrictive mechanism.},

Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a measurement method that reduces the effective transducer temperature and improves the measurement precision of a dynamic impulse response signal. Thermal noise–limited, integrated cavity optomechanical atomic force microscopy probes are used in a photothermal-induced resonance measurement to demonstrate an effective temperature reduction by a factor of ≈25, i.e., from room temperature down as low as ≈12 K, without cryogens. The method improves the experimental measurement precision and throughput by \&gt;2×, approaching the theoretical limit of ≈3.5× improvement for our experimental conditions. The general applicability of this method to dynamic measurements leveraging thermal noise–limited harmonic transducers will have a broad impact across a variety of measurement platforms and scientific fields. Optimal estimation of a sensor’s thermal state removes thermal fluctuations from impulse response measurement.}}

We show that a study performed in non-equilibrium conditions unveils the advantages provided by the use of genuinely quantum resources—such as quantum correlations—in estimating the CSL-induced diffusion rate. In stationary conditions, instead, the gap between quantum performance and a classical scheme disappears. Our investigation contributes to the ongoing effort aimed at identifying suitable conditions for the experimental assessment of collapse models.},

Quickest change-point detection has become a vital sequential analysis primitive that aims at designing procedures that minimize the expected detection delay of a change subject to a bounded expected false alarm time. We put forward the quantum counterpart of this fundamental primitive on streams of quantum data. We give a lower bound on the mean minimum delay when the expected time of a false alarm is asymptotically large, under the most general quantum detection strategy, which is given by a sequence of adaptive collective (potentially weak) measurements on the growing string of quantum data. In addition, we give particular strategies based on repeated measurements on independent blocks of samples that asymptotically attain the lower bound and thereby establish the ultimate quantum limit for quickest change-point detection. Finally, we discuss online change-point detection in quantum channels.},

As a field, it has been hugely successful in the production of precise and novel sensors, the development of low-dissipation nanomechanical devices, and the manipulation of quantum signals. Micro- and nano-particles levitated in optical fields act as nanoscale oscillators, making them excellent low-dissipation optomechanical objects, with minimal thermal contact to the environment when operating in vacuum. Levitated optomechanics is seen as the most promising route for studying high-mass quantum physics, with the promise of creating macroscopically separated superposition states at masses of 106 amu and above. Optical feedback, both using active monitoring or the passive interaction with an optical cavity, can be used to cool the centre-of-mass of levitated nanoparticles well below 1 mK, paving the way to operation in the quantum regime. In addition, trapped mesoscopic particles are the paradigmatic system for studying nanoscale stochastic processes, and have already demonstrated their utility in state-of-the-art force sensing.}

In this setting, samples of an unknown state are requested sequentially and a decision to either continue or to accept one of the two hypotheses is made after each test. Under the constraint that the number of samples is bounded, either in expectation or with high probability, we exhibit adaptive strategies that minimize both types of misidentification errors. Namely, we show that these errors decrease exponentially (in the stopping time) with decay rates given by the measured relative entropies between the two states. Moreover, if we allow joint measurements on multiple samples, the rates are increased to the respective quantum relative entropies. We also fully characterize the achievable error exponents for non-adaptive strategies and provide numerical evidence showing that adaptive measurements are necessary to achieve our bounds.},

Deli{\'c} et al. laser-cooled an optically trapped solid-state object (a ∼150-nanometer-diameter silic a nanoparticle) into its quantum ground state of motion starting from room temperature. Because the object is levitated using optical forces, the experimental configuration can be switched to free fall, thereby providing a test bed for several macroscopic quantum experiments. Science, this issue p. 892 A levitated nanoparticle trapped in an optical cavity is cooled to the quantum ground state. Quantum control of complex objects in the regime of large size and mass provides opportunities for sensing applications and tests of fundamental physics. The realization of such extreme quantum states of matter remains a major challenge. We demonstrate a quantum interface that combines optical trapping of solids with cavity-mediated light-matter interaction. Precise control over the frequency and position of the trap laser with respect to the optical cavity allowed us to laser-cool an optically trapped nanoparticle into its quantum ground state of motion from room temperature. The particle comprises 108 atoms, similar to current Bose-Einstein condensates, with the density of a solid object. Our cooling technique, in combination with optical trap manipulation, may enable otherwise unachievable superposition states involving large masses.},

abstract={Controlling a quantum system by using observations of its dynamics is complicated by the backaction of the measurement process---that is, the unavoidable quantum disturbance caused by coupling the system to a measurement apparatus. An efficient measurement is one that maximizes the amount of information gained per disturbance incurred. Real-time feedback can then be used to cancel the backaction of the measurement and to control the evolution of the quantum state. Such measurement-based quantum control has been demonstrated in the clean settings of cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics, but its application to motional degrees of freedom has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate measurement-based quantum control of the motion of a millimetre-sized membrane resonator. An optomechanical transducer resolves the zero-point motion of the resonator in a fraction of its millisecond-scale coherence time, with an overall measurement efficiency close to unity. An electronic feedback loop converts this position record to a force that cools the resonator mode to its quantum ground state (residual thermal occupation of about 0.29). This occupation is nine decibels below the quantum-backaction limit of sideband cooling and six orders of magnitude below the equilibrium occupation of the thermal environment. We thus realize a long-standing goal in the field, adding position and momentum to the degrees of freedom that are amenable to measurement-based quantum control, with potential applications in quantum information processing and gravitational-wave detectors.},

Here, we consider the possibility of continuously monitoring the atomic environment, and conclusively show that strategies based on time-continuous non-demolition measurements followed by a final strong measurement may achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling  and also a monitoring-enhanced scaling in terms of the interrogation time. We also find that time-continuous schemes are robust against detection losses, as we prove that the quantum enhancement can be recovered also for finite measurement efficiency. Finally, we analytically prove the optimality of our strategy.},

    abstract = "{A nonlinear differential equation of the Riccati type is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal filtering error. The solution of this “variance equation” completely specifies the optimal filter for either finite or infinite smoothing intervals and stationary or nonstationary statistics. The variance equation is closely related to the Hamiltonian (canonical) differential equations of the calculus of variations. Analytic solutions are available in some cases. The significance of the variance equation is illustrated by examples which duplicate, simplify, or extend earlier results in this field. The Duality Principle relating stochastic estimation and deterministic control problems plays an important role in the proof of theoretical results. In several examples, the estimation problem and its dual are discussed side-by-side. Properties of the variance equation are of great interest in the theory of adaptive systems. Some aspects of this are considered briefly.}",
