	abstract = {Detecting abrupt changes in data streams is crucial because they are often triggered by events that have important consequences if left unattended. Quickest change-point detection has become a vital sequential analysis primitive that aims at designing procedures that minimize the expected detection delay of a change subject to a bounded expected false alarm time. We put forward the quantum counterpart of this fundamental primitive on streams of quantum data. We give a lower bound on the mean minimum delay when the expected time of a false alarm is asymptotically large, under the most general quantum detection strategy, which is given by a sequence of adaptive collective (potentially weak) measurements on the growing string of quantum data. In addition, we give particular strategies based on repeated measurements on independent blocks of samples that asymptotically attain the lower bound and thereby establish the ultimate quantum limit for quickest change-point detection. Finally, we discuss online change-point detection in quantum channels.},

@article{kiilerich_hypothesis_2018,
	abstract = {In a Bayesian analysis, the likelihood that specific candidate parameters govern the evolution of a quantum system are conditioned on the outcome of measurements which, in turn, cause measurement backaction on the state of the system [Tsang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 170502 (2012)]. Specializing to the distinction of two candidate hypotheses, we study the achievements of continuous monitoring of the radiation emitted by a quantum system followed by an optimal projective measurement on its conditioned final state. Our study of the radiative decay of a driven two-level system shows an intricate interplay between the maximum information available from photon counting and homodyne detection and the final projective measurement on the emitter. We compare the results with theory predicting a lower bound for the probability to assign a wrong hypothesis by any combined measurement on the system and its radiative environment.},

@article{wald_optimum_1948,
	abstract = {Let S0 be any sequential probability ratio test for deciding between two simple alternatives H0 and H1, and S1 another test for the same purpose. We define (i, j = 0, 1): αi(Sj) = probability, under Sj, of rejecting Hi when it is true; Ei j (n) = expected number of observations to reach a decision under test Sj when the hypothesis Hi is true. (It is assumed that E1 i (n) exists.) In this paper it is proved that, if \${\textbackslash}alpha\_i(S\_1) {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}alpha\_i(S\_0){\textbackslash}quad(i = 0,1)\$, it follows that \$E\_i{\textasciicircum}0 (n) {\textbackslash}leq E\_i{\textasciicircum}1 (n){\textbackslash}quad(i = 0, 1)\$. This means that of all tests with the same power the sequential probability ratio test requires on the average fewest observations. This result had been conjectured earlier ([1], [2]).},

Most famously, the Wald--Wolfowitz theorem states that under i.i.d., no other method has both better error rates and better average sample lengths. This article presents three counterexamples to demonstrate that the Wald--Wolfowitz theorem does not hold in sequential mastery testing (SMT), an application of the SPRT where observations are not i.i.d. Consequences of this violation are discussed.},

We show that this new task is not performed optimally by previously known strategies, and derive and experimentally test a detection scheme that performs better.},

With experiments routinely reaching the quantum regime, the focus has now turned towards creating and exploiting interesting non-classical states of motion and entanglement in optomechanical systems. Quantumness has also shifted from being the very reason why experiments are constructed to becoming a resource for the investigation of fundamental physics and the creation of quantum technologies.

In this setting, samples of an unknown state are requested sequentially and a decision to either continue or to accept one of the two hypotheses is made after each test. Under the constraint that the number of samples is bounded, either in expectation or with high probability, we exhibit adaptive strategies that minimize both types of misidentification errors. Namely, we show that these errors decrease exponentially (in the stopping time) with decay rates given by the measured relative entropies between the two states. Moreover, if we allow joint measurements on multiple samples, the rates are increased to the respective quantum relative entropies. We also fully characterize the achievable error exponents for non-adaptive strategies and provide numerical evidence showing that adaptive measurements are necessary to achieve our bounds.},

Deli{\'c} et al. laser-cooled an optically trapped solid-state object (a ∼150-nanometer-diameter silic a nanoparticle) into its quantum ground state of motion starting from room temperature. Because the object is levitated using optical forces, the experimental configuration can be switched to free fall, thereby providing a test bed for several macroscopic quantum experiments. Science, this issue p. 892 A levitated nanoparticle trapped in an optical cavity is cooled to the quantum ground state. Quantum control of complex objects in the regime of large size and mass provides opportunities for sensing applications and tests of fundamental physics. The realization of such extreme quantum states of matter remains a major challenge. We demonstrate a quantum interface that combines optical trapping of solids with cavity-mediated light-matter interaction. Precise control over the frequency and position of the trap laser with respect to the optical cavity allowed us to laser-cool an optically trapped nanoparticle into its quantum ground state of motion from room temperature. The particle comprises 108 atoms, similar to current Bose-Einstein condensates, with the density of a solid object. Our cooling technique, in combination with optical trap manipulation, may enable otherwise unachievable superposition states involving large masses.},

By preparing an initial spin coherent state, for any measurement performed after the evolution, the mean-square error of the estimate is known to scale as , i.e. no quantum enhancement is obtained. Here, we consider the possibility of continuously monitoring the atomic environment, and conclusively show that strategies based on time-continuous non-demolition measurements followed by a final strong measurement may achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling  and also a monitoring-enhanced scaling in terms of the interrogation time. We also find that time-continuous schemes are robust against detection losses, as we prove that the quantum enhancement can be recovered also for finite measurement efficiency. Finally, we analytically prove the optimality of our strategy.},

@article{Amoros2021,
	abstract = {Continuously monitored atomic spin-ensembles allow, in principle, for real-time sensing of external magnetic fields beyond classical limits. Within the linear-Gaussian regime, thanks to the phenomenon of measurement-induced spin-squeezing, they attain a quantum-enhanced scaling of sensitivity both as a function of time, t, and the number of atoms involved, N. In our work, we rigorously study how such conclusions based on Kalman filtering methods change when inevitable imperfections are taken into account: in the form of collective noise, as well as stochastic fluctuations of the field in time. We prove that even an infinitesimal amount of noise disallows the error to be arbitrarily diminished by simply increasing N, and forces it to eventually follow a classical-like behaviour in t. However, we also demonstrate that, `thanks' to the presence of noise, in most regimes the model based on a homodyne-like continuous measurement actually achieves the ultimate sensitivity allowed by the decoherence, yielding then the optimal quantum-enhancement. We are able to do so by constructing a noise-induced lower bound on the error that stems from a general method of classically simulating a noisy quantum evolution, during which the stochastic parameter to be estimated---here, the magnetic field---is encoded. The method naturally extends to schemes beyond the linear-Gaussian regime, in particular, also to ones involving feedback or active control.},
