  "abstract": "We propose a macroscopic market making model à la Avellaneda-Stoikov, using continuous processes for orders instead of discrete point processes. The model intends to bridge the gap between market making and optimal execution problems, while shedding light on the influence of order flows on the optimal strategies. We demonstrate our model through three problems. The study provides a comprehensive analysis from Markovian to non-Markovian noises and from linear to non-linear intensity functions, encompassing both bounded and unbounded coefficients. Mathematically, the contribution lies in the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control, guaranteed by the well-posedness of the strong solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and the (non-)Lipschitz forward-backward stochastic differential equation. Finally, the model's applications to price impact and optimal execution are discussed.",
