@article{couponcollecotorrqm,
   abstract = {We study a new model of space-bounded computation, the random-query model. The model is based on a branching-program over input variables x 1 ,. .. , x n. In each time step, the branching program gets as an input a random index i ∈ \{1,. .. , n\}, together with the input variable x i (rather than querying an input variable of its choice, as in the case of a standard (obliv-ious) branching program). We motivate the new model in various ways and study time-space tradeoff lower bounds in this model. Our main technical result is a quadratic time-space lower bound for zero-error computations in the random-query model, for XOR, Majority and many other functions. More precisely, a zero-error computation is a computation that stops with high probability and such that conditioning on the event that the computation stopped, the output is correct with probability 1. We prove that for any Boolean function f : \{0, 1\} n → \{0, 1\}, with sensitivity k, any zero-error computation with time T and space S, satisfies T · (S + log n) ≥ Ω(n · k). We note that the best time-space lower bounds for standard oblivious branching programs are only slightly super linear and improving these bounds is an important long-standing open problem. To prove our results, we study a memory-bounded variant of the coupon-collector problem that seems to us of independent interest and to the best of our knowledge has not been studied before. We consider a zero-error version of the coupon-collector problem. In this problem, the coupon-collector could explicitly choose to stop when he/she is sure with zero-error that all coupons have already been collected. We prove that any zero-error coupon-collector that stops with high probability in time T , and uses space S, satisfies T · (S + log n) ≥ Ω(n 2), where n is the number of different coupons.},

For every $d \geq 3$ and $k \geq 4$, our approximation guarantees are better than those of all other classical and quantum algorithms known to the authors. Our algorithm constructs an explicit vector solution to the standard semidefinite relaxation of MaxCut and applies hyperplane rounding. It may be viewed as a simplification of the previously best known technique, which approximates Gaussian wave processes on the infinite $d$-regular tree.},

This is the first improvement over the sparse-graph case of the long-standing $O(m \min(\sqrt\{m\},n^\{2/3\}))$ time bound due to Even and Tarjan [EvenT75]. By well-known reductions, this also establishes an $\tilde\{O\}(m^\{10/7\})$-time algorithm for the maximum-cardinality bipartite matching problem. That, in turn, gives an improvement over the celebrated celebrated $O(m \sqrt\{n\})$ time bound of Hopcroft and Karp [HK73] whenever the input graph is sufficiently sparse.},

   abstract = {We introduce a new approach to computing an approximately maximum s-t flow in a capacitated, undirected graph. This flow is computed by solving a sequence of electrical flow problems. Each electrical flow is given by the solution of a system of linear equations in a Laplacian matrix, and thus may be approximately computed in nearly-linear time. Using this approach, we develop the fastest known algorithm for computing approximately maximum s-t flows. For a graph having n vertices and m edges, our algorithm computes a (1-\epsilon)-approximately maximum s-t flow in time \tilde\{O\}(mn^\{1/3\} \epsilon^\{-11/3\}). A dual version of our approach computes a (1+\epsilon)-approximately minimum s-t cut in time \tilde\{O\}(m+n^\{4/3\}\eps^\{-8/3\}), which is the fastest known algorithm for this problem as well. Previously, the best dependence on m and n was achieved by the algorithm of Goldberg and Rao (J. ACM 1998), which can be used to compute approximately maximum s-t flows in time \tilde\{O\}(m\sqrt\{n\}\epsilon^\{-1\}), and approximately minimum s-t cuts in time \tilde\{O\}(m+n^\{3/2\}\epsilon^\{-3\}).},
