   abstract = {Portfolio optimization is an essential use case in Finance, but its computational complexity forces financial institutions to resort to approximated solutions, which are still time consuming. Thus, the scientific community is looking at how Quantum Computing can be used for efficient and accurate portfolio optimization. Portfolio optimization can be formulated as a quadratic program, with the cost function enforcing risk minimization for a targeted return. Of particular interest is the mean-variance portfolio optimization problem. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, the program can be converted into a system of linear equations and potentially benefit from the exponential speedup provided by the HHL quantum algorithm. However, multiple components in HHL are unsuitable for execution on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. This paper introduces NISQ-HHL, the first hybrid formulation of HHL suitable for the end-to-end execution of small-scale portfolio-optimization problems on NISQ devices. NISQ-HHL extends the hybrid HHL variant with newly available quantum-hardware features: mid-circuit measurement, Quantum Conditional Logic (QCL), and qubit reset and reuse. To best of our knowledge, NISQ-HHL is the first algorithm incorporating a QCL-enhanced version of Phase Estimation that was executed on real hardware. In addition, NISQ-HHL includes a novel method for choosing the optimal evolution time for the Hamiltonian simulation. Although this paper focuses on portfolio optimization, the techniques it proposes to make HHL more scalable are generally applicable to any problem that can be solved via HHL in the NISQ era. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of NISQ-HHL by presenting the experimental results we obtained on a real quantum device, the trapped-ion Honeywell System Model H1.},

   abstract = {In this paper we present an algorithm to compute keyed hash function (message authentication code MAC). Our approach uses a family of expander graphs of large girth denoted $D(n,q)$, where $n$ is a natural number bigger than one and $q$ is a prime power. Expander graphs are known to have excellent expansion properties and thus they also have very good mixing properties. All requirements for a good MAC are satisfied in our method and a discussion about collisions and preimage resistance is also part of this work. The outputs closely approximate the uniform distribution and the results we get are indistinguishable from random sequences of bits. Exact formulas for timing are given in term of number of operations per bit of input. Based on the tests, our method for implementing DMAC shows good efficiency in comparison to other techniques. 4 operations per bit of input can be achieved. The algorithm is very flexible and it works with messages of any length. Many existing algorithms output a fixed length tag, while our constructions allow generation of an arbitrary length output, which is a big advantage.},

As examples, we investigate two specific families of optimal expander graphs for provable collision resistant hash function constructions: the families of Ramanujan graphs constructed by Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak and Pizer respectively. When the hash function is constructed from one of Pizer's Ramanujan graphs, (the set of supersingular elliptic curves over F p2 with ℓ-isogenies, ℓ a prime different from p), then collision resistance follows from hardness of computing isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. For the LPS graphs, the underlying hard problem is a representation problem in group theory. Constructing our hash functions from optimal expander graphs implies that the outputs closely approximate the uniform distribution. This property is useful for arguing that the output is indistinguishable from random sequences of bits. We estimate the cost per bit to compute these hash functions, and we implement our hash function for several members of the Pizer and LPS graph families and give actual timings. © 2007 International Association for Cryptologic Research.},

Charles-Goren-Lauter in 2006 [CGL06] proposed two hash functions based on the hardness of finding paths in Ramanujan graphs. One is based on Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak (LPS) graphs and the other one is based on Supersingular Isogeny Graphs. A 2008 paper by Petit-Lauter-Quisquater breaks the hash function based on LPS graphs. On the Supersingular Isogeny Graphs proposal, recent work has continued to build cryptographic applications on the hardness of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. A 2011 paper by De Feo-Jao-Plût proposed a cryptographic system based on Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman as well as a set of five hard problems. In this paper we show that the security of the SIDH proposal relies on the hardness of the SSIG path-finding problem introduced in [CGL06]. In addition, similarities between the number theoretic ingredients in the LPS and Pizer constructions suggest that the hardness of the path-finding problem in the two graphs may be linked. By viewing both graphs from a number theoretic perspective, we identify the similarities and differences between the Pizer and LPS graphs.},

We prove reductions between the problem of path finding in the-isogeny graph, computing maximal orders isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve, and computing the endomorphism ring itself. We also give constructive versions of Deuring's correspondence, which associates to a maximal order in a certain quaternion algebra an isomorphism class of supersingular elliptic curves. The reductions are based on heuristics regarding the distribution of norms of elements in quaternion algebras. We show that conjugacy classes of maximal orders have a representative of polynomial size, and we define a way to represent endomorphism ring generators in a way that allows for efficient evaluation at points on the curve. We relate these problems to the security of the Charles-Goren-Lauter hash function. We provide a collision attack for special but natural parameters of the hash function and prove that for general parameters its preimage and collision resistance are also equivalent to the endomorphism ring computation problem.},

In this graph, propagation between a particular pair of nodes is exponentially faster in the quantum case. [MIT-CTP #3093] Introduction. Many classical algorithms are based on random walks, so it is natural to ask whether quantum random walks might be useful for quantum computation. A framework for using quantum random walks to solve decision problems was investigated in [1]. There also, an exponential separation was found between the classical and quantum times to propagate through a certain tree. In this note, we describe a general definition of continuous-time random walks on graphs and give a simpler example of a graph for which the quantum time to propagate between a particular pair of nodes is exponentially shorter than the analogous classical propagation time. We also discuss advantages of the continuous time formulation over discrete versions.},

The main target is trying to overcome the input and output problem, which are not easy to solve and many quantum algorithms will encounter, to study matrix operations in quantum computer with high efficiency. And solving matrix multiplication will be the first step. We propose three quantum algorithms to matrix multiplication based on swap test, SVE and HHL. From the point of making fewer assumptions, swap test method works the best than the other two. We also show that the quantum algorithm of matrix multiplication with classical input and output data by swap test achieves the best complexity $\widetilde\{O\}(n^2/\epsilon)$ with no assumptions. This is proved by giving an efficient quantum algorithm in polynomial time to solve the input problem, that is to prepare the quantum states of the classical data efficiently. Other contributions of this paper include: (1). Extending swap test to a more general form that is suitable to deal with quantum data in parallel, which will have further applications in other matrix operations. (2). Generalizing SVE technique such that it applies to any matrix (not just Hermitian) directly only with quantum data. (3). Proposing two new efficient quantum algorithms to prepare quantum states of classical data, which solves the input problem efficiently than other quantum algorithms.},

   abstract = {Analyzing large sparse electrical networks is a fundamental task in physics, electrical engineering and computer science. We propose two classes of quantum algorithms for this task. The first class is based on solving linear systems, and the second class is based on using quantum walks. These algorithms compute various electrical quantities, including voltages, currents, dissipated powers and effective resistances, in time $\operatorname\{poly\}(d, c, \operatorname\{log\}(N), 1/\lambda, 1/\epsilon)$, where $N$ is the number of vertices in the network, $d$ is the maximum unweighted degree of the vertices, $c$ is the ratio of largest to smallest edge resistance, $\lambda$ is the spectral gap of the normalized Laplacian of the network, and $\epsilon$ is the accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the polynomial dependence on $1/\lambda$ is necessary. This implies that our algorithms are optimal up to polynomial factors and cannot be significantly improved.},

   abstract = {In this paper, quite tight lower and upper bounds are obtained on the algebraic connectivity, namely, the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, of an unweighted balanced binary tree with k levels and hence n = 2k - 1 vertices. This is accomplished by considering the inverse of a matrix of order k - 1 readily obtained from Laplacian matrix. It is shown that the algebraic connectivity is 1/(2k - 2k + 3) + O(1/22k).},

   abstract = {We consider the normalized Laplacian matrix for signed graphs and derive interlacing results for its spectrum. In particular, we investigate the effects of several basic graph operations, such as edge removal and addition and vertex contraction, on the Laplacian eigenvalues. We also study vertex replication, whereby a vertex in the graph is duplicated together with its neighboring relations. This operation causes the generation of a Laplacian eigenvalue equal to one. We further generalize to the replication of motifs, i.e. certain small subgraphs, and show that the resulting signed graph has an eigenvalue 1 whenever the motif itself has eigenvalue 1. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

@article{HHL09,
   abstract = {Solving linear systems of equations is a common problem that arises both on its own and as a subroutine in more complex problems: given a matrix A and a vector b→, find a vector x→ such that Ax→=b→. We consider the case where one does not need to know the solution x→ itself, but rather an approximation of the expectation value of some operator associated with x→, e.g., x→†Mx→ for some matrix M. In this case, when A is sparse, N×N and has condition number κ, the fastest known classical algorithms can find x→ and estimate x→†Mx→ in time scaling roughly as Nκ. Here, we exhibit a quantum algorithm for estimating x→†Mx→ whose runtime is a polynomial of log(N) and κ. Indeed, for small values of κ [i.e., polylog(N)], we prove (using some common complexity-theoretic assumptions) that any classical algorithm for this problem generically requires exponentially more time than our quantum algorithm. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},
