  "abstract": "We explain the physical origin of a curious property of algebras $\\mathcal{A}_\\mathfrak{q}$ which encode the rotation-equivariant fusion ring of half-BPS line defects in four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum field theories. These algebras are a quantization of the algebras of holomorphic functions on the three-dimensional Coulomb branch of the SQFTs, with deformation parameter $\\log \\mathfrak{q}$. They are known to acquire a large center, canonically isomorphic to the undeformed algebra, whenever $\\mathfrak{q}$ is a root of unity. We give a physical explanation of this fact. We also generalize the construction to characterize the action of this center in the $\\mathcal{A}_\\mathfrak{q}$-modules associated to three-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ boundary conditions. Finally, we use dualities to relate this construction to a construction in the Kapustin-Witten twist of four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theory. These considerations give simple physical explanations of certain properties of quantized skein algebras and cluster varieties, and quantum groups, when the deformation parameter is a root of unity.",
