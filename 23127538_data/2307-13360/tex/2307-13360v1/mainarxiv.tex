%Concurrent systems}


\begin{abstract}
Undoing computations of a concurrent system is beneficial in many
situations, e.g., in reversible debugging of multi-threaded programs
and in recovery from errors due to optimistic execution in parallel
discrete event simulation. A number of approaches have been proposed
for how to reverse formal models of concurrent computation including
process calculi such as CCS, languages like Erlang, prime event
structures and occurrence nets.  However it has not been settled what
properties a reversible system should enjoy, nor how the various
properties that have been suggested, such as the parabolic lemma and
the causal-consistency property, are related.  We contribute to a
solution to these issues by using a generic labelled transition system
equipped with a relation capturing whether transitions are independent
to explore the implications between these properties.  In particular,
we show how they are derivable from a set of axioms.  Our intention is
that when establishing properties of some formalism it will be easier
to verify the axioms rather than proving properties such as the
parabolic lemma directly.  We also introduce two new notions related
to causal consistent reversibility, namely causal liveness and causal
safety, stating, respectively, that an action can be undone if and
only if it is independent from all the following ones.  We show that
both causal liveness and causal safety are derivable from our axioms.

% We also characterise causal-consistent reversibility by two new
% properties: causal safety and causal liveness. We investigate several
% ways to define these properties, and compare them.  We show that these
% properties are not derivable from the basic axioms above, but require
% additional axioms. As a result, they are not consequences of the
% causal-consistency property, as erroneously hinted at in the literature.

%Hence proofs of the parabolic lemma and the causal
%consistency property are not sufficient on their own, since they are
%consequences of the basic axioms.  However, if we add an additional
%axiom, we can then derive causal safety and liveness.
