  "abstract": "Large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can effectively enhance the performance of millimeter wave (mmWave) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to ground communication link with obstructed line-of-sight (LoS) path by exploiting more reflecting units. However, the non-negligible array dimension of large-scale RIS and the mobile property of the terminals bring significant variations in propagation characteristics, making conventional channel models inapplicable. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic sub-array partition scheme to divide the large-scale RIS into sub-arrays by exploiting the Rayleigh distance criterion and the mobile property of the transceivers. Based on the proposed scheme, a novel non-stationary channel model for large-scale RIS auxiliary mmWave UAV-to-ground mobile networks is developed, which outperforms existing models with well balance between model complexity and accuracy. Numerical results are provided to verify our analysis.",
