  "abstract": "We aim at finding static, spherically symmetric, vacuum solutions of a gauge invariant theory of gravity over Weyl integrable geometry spaces. It arises that vacuum wormholes of pure geometric nature are solutions of this theory. This means that there is not necessary to place any exotic matter at the throat of the wormhole in order to support it. A thorough discussion of the related gauge freedom and its experimental consequences is also given.",
