  "abstract": "Existing molecular communication systems, both theoretical and experimental, are characterized by low information rates. In this paper, inspired by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS), we consider the design of a molecular communication system in which the channel is a vacuum and demonstrate that this method has the potential to increase achievable information rates by many orders of magnitude. We use modelling results from TOFMS to obtain arrival time distributions for accelerated ions and use them to analyze several species of ions, including hydrogen, nitrogen, argon, and benzene. We show that the achievable information rates can be increased using a velocity (Wien) filter, which reduces uncertainty in the velocity of the ions. Using a simplified communication model, we show that data rates well above 1 Gbit/s/molecule are achievable.",
