ABSTRACT = {Computer modelling and digitalization are integral to the wind energy sector since they provide tools with which to improve the design and performance of wind turbines, and thus reduce both capital and operational costs. The massive sensor rollout and increase in big data processing capacity over the last decade has made data collection and analysis more efficient, allowing for the development and use of digital twins. This paper presents a methodology for developing a hybrid-model-based digital twin (DT) of a power conversion system of wind turbines. This DT allows knowledge to be acquired from real operation data while preserving physical design relationships, can generate synthetic data from events that never happened, and helps in the detection and classification of different failure conditions. Starting from an initial physics-based model of a wind turbine drivetrain, which is trained with real data, the proposed methodology has two major innovative outcomes. The first innovation aspect is the application of generative stochastic models coupled with a hybrid-model-based digital twin (DT) for the creation of synthetic failure data based on real anomalies observed in SCADA data. The second innovation aspect is the classification of failures based on machine learning techniques, that allows anomaly conditions to be identified in the operation of the wind turbine. Firstly, technique and methodology were contrasted and validated with operation data of a real wind farm owned by Engie, including labelled failure conditions. Although the selected use case technology is based on a double-fed induction generator (DFIG) and its corresponding partial-scale power converter, the methodology could be applied to other wind conversion technologies.},

ABSTRACT = {Modern wind turbines operate in continuously transient conditions, with varying speed, torque, and power based on the stochastic nature of the wind resource. This variability affects not only the operational performance of the wind power system, but can also affect its integrity under service conditions. Condition monitoring continues to play an important role in achieving reliable and economic operation of wind turbines. This paper reviews the current advances in wind turbine condition monitoring, ranging from conventional condition monitoring and signal processing tools to machine-learning-based condition monitoring and usage of big data mining for predictive maintenance. A systematic review is presented of signal-based and data-driven modeling methodologies using intelligent and machine learning approaches, with the view to providing a critical evaluation of the recent developments in this area, and their applications in diagnosis, prognosis, health assessment, and predictive maintenance of wind turbines and farms.},

abstract = {Renewable energy is being embraced globally as a viable alternative to conventional fossil fuels generators. This is in direct response to the challenge of depleting fossil fuel reserves and its impact on environmental pollution. Wind energy has continued to play a significant role and can be regarded as the most deployed renewable energy source, however the efficiency level and cost effectiveness of a wind turbine (WT) system with regards to wind application is very much dependent on its control. This research paper reviews the various control methods associated with wind energy control. More recently there has been an attempt to review these control techniques but the authors have focused more on the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques and pitch angle control of WTs however discussions around stall control of the WT is not presented in these research papers. This review paper presents a detailed review of the various operational control strategies of WTs, the stall control of WTs and the role of power electronics in wind system which have not been documented in previous reviews of WT control. This research aims to serve as a detailed reference for future studies on the control of wind turbine systems.}

However, given that most current data-driven algorithms have been developed for canonical problems, the enormous complexity of fluid flows in real wind farms poses unique challenges for data-driven flow modeling. These include the high-dimensional multiscale nature of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, geophysical and atmospheric effects, wake-flow development, and incorporating wind-turbine characteristics and wind-farm layouts, among others. In addition, data-driven wind-farm flow models should ideally be interpretable and have some degree of generalizability. The former is important to avoid a lack of trust in the models with end-users, while the most popular strategy for the latter is to incorporate known physics into the models. This article reviews a collection of recent studies on wind-farm flow modeling, covering both purely data-driven and physics-guided approaches. We provide a thorough analysis of their modeling approach, objective, and methodology and specifically focus on the data utilized in the reviewed works.}",

  ABSTRACT = {To achieve the maximum power from wind in variable-speed regions of wind turbines (WTs), a suitable control signal should be applied to the pitch angle of the blades. However, the available uncertainty in the modeling of WTs complicates calculations of these signals. To cope with this problem, an optimal controller is suitable, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO). To improve the performance of the controller, fractional order PSO (FPSO) is proposed and implemented. In order to construct this approach for a two-mass WT, we propose a new state feedback, which was first applied to the turbine. The idea behind this state feedback was based on the Taylor series. Then, a linear model with uncertainty was obtained with a new input control signal. Thereafter, the conventional PSO (CPSO) and FPSO were used as optimal controllers for the resulting linear model. Finally, a comparison was performed between CPSO and FPSO and the fuzzy Takagi&ndash;Sugeno&ndash;Kang (TSK) inference system. The provided comparison demonstrates the advantages of the Taylor series with combination to these controllers. Notably, without the state feedback, CPSO, FPSO, and TSK fuzzy systems cannot stabilize WTs in tracking the desired trajectory.},

One of the most promising approaches is Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which can combine both data, obtained from sensors or numerical solvers, and physics knowledge, expressed as partial differential equations. In this work, we investigated the suitability of PINNs to replace current available numerical methods for physics simulations. Although the PINN approach is general and independent of the complexity of the underlying physics equations, a selection of typical heat transfer and fluid dynamics problems was proposed and multiple PINNs were comprehensibly trained and tested to solve them. When PINNs were used as learned simulators, the outcome of our experiments was not entirely satisfactory as not enough accuracy was achieved even though optimal configurations and long training times were used. The main cause for this limitation was found to be the lack of adequate activation functions and specialized architectures, since they proved to have a notable impact on the final accuracy of each model. In turn, PINN architectures showed an accurate behavior when used for parameter inference of partial differential equations from data.}

Increasing the wind pick out capability improves the economic viability of this technology, and makes it more rivalry with traditional fossil-fuel based supplies. Therefore, it is necessary to search control strategies that increase aerodynamic efficiency. Several controls are applied and compared during this research. The angle of blade pitch is employed to control the wind turbine (SCIG) operation during partial and full load operations, correspondingly. This work is achieved using Matlab/Simulink simulation. The effect of some compensation modules is studied such as unified power flow controllers (UPFC) and three types of smart technologies on the performance of the IEEE 9 bus.

Finally, the nonlinear auto regressive-moving average (NARMA-L2) based on PI controller. The results show that the controllers used had better improvement in active power and the response of turbine in terms of reduced error for a steady state and ripple reduction in the torque and speed responses. In addition, NARMA-L2 controller presents better results from other methods especially in power output and in terms of reducing the steady state errors of load changes and ripple minimization, making this controller more active to the load and speed variations.}

This work presents a novel controller structure that relies on the separation of low-level control tasks and high-level ones. It is based on a neural network that modulates basic periodic pitch angle signals. This neural network is trained with reinforcement learning, a trial and error way of acquiring skills, in a low-fidelity environment exempt from turbulence. The trained controller is further deployed in large eddy simulations to assess its performances in turbulent and waked flows. Results show that the method enables the neural network to learn how to reduce fatigue loads and to exploit that knowledge to complex turbulent flows. When compared to a state-of-the-art individual pitch controller, the one introduced here presents similar load alleviation capacities at reasonable turbulence intensity levels, while displaying very smooth pitching commands by nature.},

In this paper, we propose a novel method for training non-Bayesian NNs to estimate a continuous target as well as its associated evidence in order to learn both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over the original Gaussian likelihood function and training the NN to infer the hyperparameters of the evidential distribution. We additionally impose priors during training such that the model is regularized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Our method does not rely on sampling during inference or on out-of-distribution (OOD) examples for training, thus enabling efficient and scalable uncertainty learning. We demonstrate learning well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scaling to complex computer vision tasks, as well as robustness to adversarial and OOD test samples.},

While recent approaches use Bayesian optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration nonstochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 is considered to be the fourth industrial revolution introducing a new paradigm of digital, autonomous, and decentralized control for manufacturing systems. Two key objectives for Industry 4.0 applications are to guarantee maximum uptime throughout the production chain and to increase productivity while reducing production cost. As the data-driven economy evolves, enterprises have started to utilize big data techniques to achieve these objectives. Big data and IoT technologies are playing a pivotal role in building data-oriented applications such as predictive maintenance. In this paper, we use a systematic methodology to review the strengths and weaknesses of existing open-source technologies for big data and stream processing to establish their usage for Industry 4.0 use cases. We identified a set of requirements for the two selected use cases of predictive maintenance in the areas of rail transportation and wind energy. We conducted a breadth-first mapping of predictive maintenance use-case requirements to the capabilities of big data streaming technologies focusing on open-source tools. Based on our research, we propose some optimal combinations of open-source big data technologies for our selected use cases.}

Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages.

ABSTRACT = {Turbulent wakes trailing utility-scale wind turbines reduce the power production and efficiency of downstream turbines. Thorough understanding and modeling of these wakes is required to optimally design wind farms as well as control and predict their power production. While low-order, physics-based wake models are useful for qualitative physical understanding, they generally are unable to accurately predict the power production of utility-scale wind farms due to a large number of simplifying assumptions and neglected physics. In this study, we propose a suite of physics-informed statistical models to accurately predict the power production of arbitrary wind farm layouts. These models are trained and tested using five years of historical one-minute averaged operational data from the Summerview wind farm in Alberta, Canada. The trained models reduce the prediction error compared both to a physics-based wake model and a standard two-layer neural network. The trained parameters of the statistical models are visualized and interpreted in the context of the flow physics of turbulent wind turbine wakes.},

    abstract = { A wind turbines’ power curve is an easily accessible form of damage-sensitive data, and as such is a key part of structural health monitoring (SHM) in wind turbines. Power curve models can be constructed in a number of ways, but the authors argue that probabilistic methods carry inherent benefits in this use case, such as uncertainty quantification and allowing uncertainty propagation analysis. Many probabilistic power curve models have a key limitation in that they are not physically meaningful – they return mean and uncertainty predictions outside of what is physically possible (the maximum and minimum power outputs of the wind turbine). This paper investigates the use of two bounded Gaussian processes (GPs) in order to produce physically meaningful probabilistic power curve models. The first model investigated was a warped heteroscedastic Gaussian process, and was found to be ineffective due to specific shortcomings of the GP in relation to the warping function. The second model – an approximated GP with a Beta likelihood was highly successful and demonstrated that a working bounded probabilistic model results in better predictive uncertainty than a corresponding unbounded one without meaningful loss in predictive accuracy. Such a bounded model thus offers increased accuracy for performance monitoring and increased operator confidence in the model due to guaranteed physical plausibility. }

abstract = {The expected growth in wind energy capacity requires efficient and accurate models for wind farm layout optimization, control, and annual energy predictions. Although analytical wake models are widely used for these applications, several model components must be better understood to improve their accuracy. To this end, we propose a Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework for physics-guided data-driven model enhancement. The framework incorporates turbulence-related aleatoric uncertainty in historical wind farm data, epistemic uncertainty in the empirical parameters, and systematic uncertainty due to unmodeled physics. We apply the framework to the wake expansion parametrization in the Gaussian wake model and employ historical power data of the Westermost Rough Offshore Wind Farm. We find that the framework successfully distinguishes the three sources of uncertainty in the joint posterior distribution of the parameters. On the one hand, the framework allows for wake model calibration by selecting the maximum a posteriori estimators for the empirical parameters. On the other hand, it facilitates model validation by separating the measurement error and the model error distribution. In addition, the model adequacy and the effect of unmodeled physics are assessable via the posterior parameter uncertainty and correlations. Consequently, we believe that the Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework can be used to calibrate and validate existing and upcoming physics-guided models.},

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {An artificial neural network based reduced order model (ROM) is developed to predict the load coefficients and performance of wind turbine airfoils. The model is trained using a representative database of 972 wind turbine airfoil shapes generated by perturbing the design parameters in each of 12 baseline airfoils defining commercially relevant modern wind turbines. The predictions from our ROM show excellent agreement with the CFD data, with a 99th percentile maximum errors of 0.03 in lift-coefficient, 2 in lift-to-drag ratio and 0.002 in pitching moment coefficient. A Monte-Carlo based uncertainty quantification (UQ) and global sensitivity analysis (GSA) framework is developed using this computationally economical ROM. Using UQ, we observed the stall behavior to be very sensitive to geometric uncertainty, with more than 10% deviation in lift coefficient associated to 5% deviation in geometric features. Sobol’s analysis is used to identify the most influencing geometric feature for the stall behavior to be concentrated at the maximum thickness location on the airfoil suction surface.}

Deep learning (DL) excels at describing complex relationships. However, it is typically not applicable to WTPC modeling with a single wind speed input. This study proposes a novel data-driven DL approach mELM-CA-CNN to establish WTPCs based on multiple extreme learning machines (ELMs), channel attention (CA), convolutional neural network (CNN), and Huber loss (HL). First, multiple ELMs map a single wind speed to various high-dimensional feature spaces. Then, CA helps reduce redundant mappings of ELMs. Next, CNN extracts important features from all ELM mappings and models the complex relationship between wind speed and the corresponding power. Finally, the proposed model is trained with the differentiable and robust HL. To reduce the adverse impact of outliers on WTPC modeling, a segmented data cleaning approach based on 3σ criterion and quartile algorithm is proposed. Comparisons with some popular WTPC models demonstrate that mELM-CA-CNN obtains the most accurate WTPCs on four wind datasets, showing the superiority of the proposed DL approach. Moreover, the roles of the different modules of mELM-CA-CNN in improving model performance are verified.}

Due to the unpredictable and complex nature of offshore aero-hydro dynamics, the Wind Turbine Power Curve (WTPC) model is an important tool for power forecasting and, hence, providing a reliable, predictable, and stable power supply. With the development of data-driven approaches, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has become a popular method for estimating WTPCs. This paper integrates the Isolation Forest (iForest), Nonsymmetric Fuzzy Means (NSFM) Radial Basis Neural Network (RBFNN), and metaheuristic algorithm to form a novel WTPC model. iForest performed anomaly detection and removal, NSFM RBFNN approximated the WTPC, and the metaheuristic solved NSFM optimization without training RBFNN. Four real-world datasets were used to assess the performance of NSFM RBFNN. According to multiple evaluation metrics and the Diebold-Mariano test, the accuracy of NSFM RBFNN was significantly better than the other competitive neural network-based methods. Additionally, NSFM RBFNN was shown to be more robust to anomalies than competitors, which is highly beneficial for practical applications.}

The main contribution of this work is the development of an innovative reinforcement learning (RL)-based control method targeting wind turbine applications. Our RL-based control framework synergistically combines the advantages of deep neural networks (DNNs) and model predictive control (MPC) technologies. The proposed control strategy is data-driven, adapting to real-time changes in system dynamics and enhancing control performance and robustness. Additionally, the incorporation of an MPC structure within our design improves learning efficiency and reduces the high computational complexity typically found in deep RL algorithms. Specifically, a DNN is designed to approximate the wind turbine dynamics based on a continuously updated dataset composed of state and action measurements taken at specified sampling intervals. The real-time control policy is generated by integrating the online trained DNN into an MPC architecture. The proposed method iteratively updates the DNN and control policy in real-time to optimize performance. As a primary result of this work, the proposed method demonstrates superior robustness and control performance compared to commonly-employed MPC and other baseline wind turbine controllers in the presence of uncertainties and unexpected actuator faults. This effectiveness is showcased through simulations with a high-fidelity wind turbine simulator.}

abstract = {Subjected to strong cyclic wind and wave loads, wind turbines could experience severe fatigue damages and possibly fail to function normally due to accumulated damages at certain critical locations. Therefore, fatigue damage evaluation and prediction are essential and important to be conducted, which could involve massive numerical simulations and computational costs due to dynamic analyses of the wind turbines under various environmental conditions. To reduce the calculation cost related to the time-consuming dynamic analysis, sequence models such as the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the long-short term memory model (LSTM) originated from the deep learning topic are good and promising candidates to predict structural dynamic responses at multiple critical locations under different environmental scenarios. However, the training cost and prediction accuracy of these deep learning models might not be satisfiable since these models are purely data-driven and require significant amount of training data and a large number of training parameters. To reduce the computational cost and improve the prediction accuracy, a hybrid method that integrates the physical information of the underlying wind turbine system into the data-driven model is implemented in the present study as a computationally efficient simulation model. Structural properties and linearized representations of the wind turbine system are served as the physical constraints and applied in a recently proposed deep residual recurrent neural network (DR-RNN) to form as a physics-informed deep learning model. This physics-informed model is first applied to a frame structure with four degrees of freedom as a benchmark study to show the accuracy and efficiency of this model. The applicability of this physics-informed model to a complex wind turbine system is then investigated, and the performance of the developed physics-informed model on the structural response prediction is also compared with a regular data-driven model.}

Nevertheless, the exploitation of small turbines usually faces with several shortcomings and the actual return is often lower than expected, mainly because the power curve given by the manufacturer usually does not reproduce the actual behaviour of the turbines during the operating conditions. Using high-resolution wind speed and energy production measurements, this paper presents an in situ experimental analysis of two small size wind turbines with the same rated power, placed in the same urban environment and realized with vertical and horizontal axis, respectively. Wind conditions are particularly interesting as they are characterized by two distinct regimes, corresponding to low (wind blowing from the sea) and high turbulence (wind blowing from the land). The detected power production is discussed, showing the mutual strengths and weaknesses of the two technologies, focusing on the role of the technical features and control apparatus on the one hand and of the incoming wind conditions and turbulence on the other.}

Second, the models are established based on three nonparametric algorithms, i.e. Monte Carlo, neural network, and fuzzy clustering. Third, to fill the research gap on model evaluation, the desirable properties of a probabilistic WTPC model are defined as expected variance ratio (EVR), and this index is formulated by calculating the cumulative gaps between the simulated and actual power distribution in each wind speed segment. Data from two Chinese wind farms are used to validate and compare the proposed methods using the mainstream deterministic index and the proposed EVR. Results show that (i) new model inputs and data clearing methods are able to improve the accuracy for probabilistic models regardless of the afterwards modelling method; (ii) fuzzy outperforms other probabilistic models.}

The hybrid model has been developed to get short-term power forecasts using both historical in-situ measurements available from ENGIE and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) global reanalysis dataset. Meteorology is connected with chemistry because weather is the state of air, determined by pressure and temperature variations. This means that enriching historical measurements with weather data has a potential to get better predictions. It was shown that adding three extra meteorological parameters – pressure, humidity, and temperature – allowed to reach a higher accuracy compared with cases when weather parameters were completely ignored or used partially; this was proved by applying multivariate, one-step Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Finally, the paper explains how to apply LSTM networks for the day-ahead forecasts. In particular, two state-of-the-art models were investigated – a base LSTM network and a more advanced method which combines convolutional and LSTM layers through the CNN-LSTM approach. Results showed the latter network reached higher accuracy for both 12- and 24-h forecasts and performed faster than an ordinary LSTM network. A significant advantage of both methods deals with their light structure which allows running models on the Central Processing Unit (CPU).}

Forecasting renewable energy sources has therefore become essential in balancing the power grid.

One reason for this lack of attention is the limited availability of open-source datasets, as many currently used datasets are non-disclosed and make reproducibility of research impossible. This unavailability of open-source datasets is especially prevalent in commercially interesting fields such as wind power forecasting. However, with this paper, we want to enable researchers to compare their methods on publicly available datasets by providing the, to our knowledge, largest up-to-date overview of existing open-source wind power datasets, and a categorization into different groups of datasets that can be used for wind power forecasting. We show that there are publicly available datasets sufficient for wind power forecasting tasks and discuss the different data groups properties to enable researchers to choose appropriate open-source datasets and compare their methods on them.},
