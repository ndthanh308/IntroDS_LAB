\subsection{\textit{In vivo} experiments and Digital Image Correlation}

Twelve subjects, eight male and four female were tested during Peritoneal Dialysis fluid exchange (PD); CAPD-continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis - 4 exchanges of PD solution per day or APD -A utomatic peritoneal dialysis - nightly PD performed by cycler with or without fluid left for the day. Their characteristics are included in Table \ref{Table_patient}. The subjects suffer from end-stage kidney disease and regularly undergo PD. Thus, the experiments were performed during the dialysis procedure (see \cite{in_vivo_abdomen}). A Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system was applied in the study to register the motion of their abdominal walls.
DIC is an optically-based technique used to measure the evolving full-field 2D or 3D coordinates on the surface of a test piece throughout a mechanical test \citep {DICpractice}. The measured data can be used to calculate, e.g., displacements, strains and other quantities based on changes in the registered geometry of the objects undergoing movement. The system can map the motion and deformation of the tested piece by taking series of images that can replicate the motion of the speckle pattern applied to the specimen. It can  also be used to reconstruct the abdominal wall geometry. A four-camera DIC system Dantec Q-400 was used. This included 4 digital VCXU-23M cameras  with a 2.3 Mpx matrix (resolution: 1920 x 1200 px) and  VS-1620HV lenses(16 mm f/2.0–16) (Figure \ref{fig_stand}).
The stand was situated above the area of interest (front abdominal wall) in a way that enables the correlation of images of the whole abdominal wall (Figure \ref{fig_test}). A random speckle pattern was printed on a 3D printer with the use of a flexible filament in the form of a stamp. The pattern was applied to the abdomen of each subject using  approved  skin colouring paint (Figure \ref{fig_test}). A chequerboard calibration plate (35mm, 9x9 Marked White Plastic) was used to capture the relative positions of the four cameras mounted on two tripods and thus calibrate the system before the  measurement.

The motion of the abdomen was registered in  pictures taken throughout the PD procedure, starting with a drained abdominal cavity and finishing with it being filled with two litres  of dialysis fluid \citep {Durand1996}. Then intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) was measured, (Figure  \ref{fig_PD}) with the use of manometer connected to the dialysis bag, as in \citep{PerezDiaz2017}. 
The collected images were processed using the commercial correlation software Istra 4.7.6.580 to determine the three-dimensional displacement of the  surface of each tested abdominal wall. For  selected parameters used in  the image analysis, see Table \ref{Table_dic_parameters}. DIC measurements have an approximated error radius (\ref{Error_equation})
\begin{equation}
    Err=\sqrt{1/3(V(x)+V(y)+V(z))},
    \label{Error_equation}
\end{equation}
which estimates the uncertainty of the 3D coordinates ($x$, $y$, $z$), where $V$ is the variance.

The experiments were fully non-invasive and the measurement was contactless. All participants  consented to participate in the study under a protocol approved by the local Ethics Committee (NKBBN 314/2018).

\subsection{Strain field of abdominal wall outer surface as the basis for mechanical analysis }

The displacements and subsequent strains were computed in each grid point. A local Green-Lagrange strain tensor was used (\ref{GL_strain_tensor})
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E}=\frac{1}{2}\left( \mathbf{F}^\top \mathbf{F} - \mathbf{I}\right),
    \label{GL_strain_tensor}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{F}$ is the deformation gradient. Their eignevalues and eigenvectors, i.e. principal strains ($\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$) and directions ($\alpha$), are the quantities on which the analysis is based. $\alpha$ is the angle between transverse direction x and principal direction.

Due to the catheter, which covered part of the registration field, only half of the abdominal wall was considered in the study, Figure \ref{fig_test}. The presence of the catheter disturbs the strain field of the abdominal wall ,as already presented in (\cite{in_vivo_abdomen}). Four time-steps representing four different deformation states of the abdominal wall were selected for analysis so that two pairs of time-steps corresponding to one inhalation of air were captured at the early and final stages of the experiment, (Figure \ref{czas_T1T4}).  T1 and T2 denote time-steps  at ca. 20\% of the experiment duration, exhalation and inhalation, respectively.   T3 and T4 denote time-steps at the final stage (T3 exhalation and T4 inhalation) of the experiment, when the abdominal cavity is filled with 2l of dialysis fluid.
