\begin{abstract}
Ballistic capture orbits offer safer Mars injection at longer transfer time. However, the search for such an extremely rare event is a computationally-intensive process. Indeed, it requires the propagation of a grid sampling the whole search space. This work proposes a novel ballistic capture search algorithm based on Taylor differential algebra propagation. This algorithm provides a continuous description of the search space compared to classical grid sampling research and focuses on areas where the nonlinearities are the largest. Two criteria, named consistency and quality, are defined to assess this new algorithm  and to compare its performances with classical grid sampling of the search space around Mars. Results show that differential algebra mapping works on large search spaces, and automatic domain splitting captured the dynamical variations on the whole domain successfully. The consistency criterion shows that more than 87\% of the search space is guaranteed as accurate, and the quality criterion demonstrates that the quality criterion is kept over 80\%.
