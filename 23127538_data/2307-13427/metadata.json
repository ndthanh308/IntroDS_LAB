  "abstract": "Situation awareness is a crucial cognitive skill that enables individuals to perceive, comprehend, and project the current state of their environment accurately. It involves being conscious of relevant information, understanding its meaning, and using that understanding to make well-informed decisions. Awareness systems often need to integrate new knowledge and adapt to changing environments. Ontology reasoning facilitates knowledge integration and evolution, allowing for seamless updates and expansions of the ontology. With the consideration of above, we are providing a quick review on semantic information retrieval and ontology engineering to understand the emerging challenges and future research. In the review we have found that the ontology reasoning addresses the limitations of traditional systems by providing a formal, flexible, and scalable framework for knowledge representation, reasoning, and inference.",
