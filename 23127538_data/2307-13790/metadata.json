  "abstract": "Leptoquarks are theorized particles of either scalar or vector nature that couple simultaneously to quarks and leptons. Motivated by recent measurements of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, we consider the impact of scalar leptoquarks coupling to neutrinos on a few complementary processes, from low energy to colliders. In particular, we set competitive constraints on the typical mass and coupling of scalar leptoquarks by analyzing recent COHERENT data. We compare these constraints with bounds from atomic parity violation experiments, deep inelastic neutrino-nucleon scattering and LHC data. Our results highlight a strong complementarity between different facilities and demonstrate the compelling power of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments to probe leptoquark masses in the MeV-GeV range. Finally, we also present prospects for improving current bounds with future upgrades of the COHERENT detectors and the planned European Spallation Source.",
