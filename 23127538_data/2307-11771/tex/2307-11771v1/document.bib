   abstract = {To find out what other people think has been an essential part of information-gathering behaviors. And in the case of movies, the movie reviews can provide an intricate insight into the movie and can help decide whether it is worth spending time on. However, with the growing amount of data in reviews, it is quite prudent to automate the process, saving on time. Sentiment analysis is an important field of study in machine learning that focuses on extracting information of subject from the textual reviews. The area of analysis of sentiments is related closely to natural language processing and text mining. It can successfully be used to determine the attitude of the reviewer in regard to various topics or the overall polarity of the review. In the case of movie reviews, along with giving a rating in numeric to a movie, they can enlighten us on the favorableness or the opposite of a movie quantitatively; a collection of those then gives us a comprehensive qualitative insight on different facets of the movie. Opinion mining from movie reviews can be challenging due to the fact that human language is rather complex, leading to situations where a positive word has a negative connotation and vice versa. In this study, the task of opinion mining from movie reviews has been achieved with the use of neural networks trained on the “Movie Review Database” issued by Stanford, in conjunction with two big lists of positive and negative words. The trained network managed to achieve a final accuracy of 91%.},

One of the data mining algorithms that are most frequently used in research is the Support Vector Machine because itworks well as a method of classifying text but has a very sensitive deficiency in the selection of features. The Information Gain method as feature selection can solve problems faster and more stable convergence levels. After testing on two movie review datasets are Cornell and Stanford datasets.The results obtained on the Cornell dataset is the Support Vector Machine algorithm to produce an accuracy of 83.05%, while for the Support Vector Machine based on Information Gain, the accuracy value is 85.65%. Increased accuracy reached 2.6%. Then, the results obtained on the Stanford dataset is the Support Vector Machine algorithm yields a value of 86.46%, while for the Support Vector Machine based on Information Gain, the accuracy value is 86.62%. Increased accuracy reached 0.166%. Support Vector Machine based Information Gain on the problem of movie review sentiment analysis proved to provide more accurate value.},

   abstract = {Social Networking sites have become popular and common places for sharing wide range of emotions through short texts. These emotions include happiness, sadness, anxiety, fear, etc. Analyzing short texts helps in identifying the sentiment expressed by the crowd. Sentiment Analysis on IMDb movie reviews identifies the overall sentiment or opinion expressed by a reviewer towards a movie. Many researchers are working on pruning the sentiment analysis model that clearly identifies and distinguishes between a positive review and a negative review. In the proposed work, we show that the use of Hybrid features obtained by concatenating Machine Learning features (TF, TF-IDF) with Lexicon features (Positive-Negative word count, Connotation) gives better results both in terms of accuracy and complexity when tested against classifiers like SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN and Maximum Entropy. The proposed model clearly differentiates between a positive review and negative review Since understanding the context of the reviews plays an important role in classification, using hybrid features helps in capturing the context of the movie reviews and hence increases the accuracy of classification.},

People give their opinion in a variety of formats like reviews, blogs, news, or comments. Sentiment Analysis is used quick gaining insights using large volumes of text data which can be helpful in improving the quality of service and can make companies to earn huge profits. In sentimental analysis, modeling of sentimental relations such as word negation and word intensification are great challenge. In the proposed work, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is constructed for classifying user sentiments on IMDB Movie Review and Amazon Fine Food Review datasets. Word negations and intensifications are also considered for deriving the sentiment of reviews. The experimental results shows that the BERT can capture the sentimental relations effectively than basic ML, DL models and other recent literatures.},

   abstract = {The idea of sentimental analysis is getting attention for the last few years. The key challenges in a sentimental analysis are the collection of huge data from the sources, applying appropriate algorithms or techniques, and classifying them into different sentiments. In this fast-spreading internet world, social media provides a platform for individuals to express their sentiments. With the changing ways of things in different areas in our day-to-day life, the way of expressing one's view or opinion has also changed. People tend to express themselves in their regional language or in a way convenient to them. These individual reviews play an important role in decision-making. With the huge amount of data that is obtained on social media, it is of no use if the opinions are not classified based on their sentiments. This paper provides information about the tweets posted by the customer are positive, negative, or neutral. For this the proposed model first scrape the tweets from Twitter by using Twitter APIs, then later by using text blob, the customer reviews are given different sentiment scores and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral by using text classification model.

   abstract = {With the rapid development of social media, reliable information released by the public on social media can provide important decision-making support. Therefore, the consideration of the public as another decision-making body participating in large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) problems has become an extensively researched topic. However, the participation of the public as a decision-making body with decision-making experts faces several issues, such as the acquisition of public opinion, the reliability of public opinion, the integration of public and expert opinions, etc. Given this, this paper proposes a public and large-scale expert information fusion method that considers public dynamic reliability via sentiment analysis and intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN) expressions. First, sentiment analysis technology is used to process public social media data and obtain IFNs as the opinions of the public decision-making body. Second, the concept of public dynamic reliability is defined to measure the degree of integration of public opinion. Third, a novel information entropy measure of IFNs is proposed, and a new method is introduced to determine the criteria weights under the two different decision-making bodies. Finally, an optimization model that considers the consensus levels of expert subgroups is proposed to determine the weights of different decision-making bodies. The public and expert opinions are then aggregated to obtain collective decision-making information. A case study is proposed to illustrate the application of the proposed method, and the comparative analysis reveals the features and advantages of this model.},

This study aimed to explore LMOOC students' sentiments and opinions through sentiment analysis and content analysis of their comments posted in the discussion forums of 60 LMOOCs and examine the correlation between student sentiment and course rating. The results indicated that the majority of the comments were positive, and student sentiment was positively correlated with course rating. Five major themes that encapsulated students' opinions about LMOOCs and their experiences in LMOOC learning were identified: attitudes towards the LMOOCs, comments on the LMOOCs, evaluations of LMOOC instruction and instructors, learning outcomes, and suggestions. To shed light on LMOOC development, the LMOOC learners’ concerns and suggestions were particularly examined, and tactics possibly used by learners to express euphemistically or circumvent negative feedback were speculated. Implications for LMOOC instructors and developers and future research are finally presented.},

   abstract = {A clinical sentiment is a judgment, thought or attitude promoted by an observation with respect to the health of an individual. Sentiment analysis has drawn attention in the healthcare domain for secondary use of data from clinical narratives, with a variety of applications including predicting the likelihood of emerging mental illnesses or clinical outcomes. The current state of research has not yet been summarized. This study presents results from a scoping review aiming at providing an overview of sentiment analysis of clinical narratives in order to summarize existing research and identify open research gaps. The scoping review was carried out in line with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guideline. Studies were identified by searching 4 electronic databases (e.g., PubMed, IEEE Xplore) in addition to conducting backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies. We extracted information on use cases, methods and tools applied, used datasets and performance of the sentiment analysis approach. Of 1,200 citations retrieved, 29 unique studies were included in the review covering a period of 8 years. Most studies apply general domain tools (e.g. TextBlob) and sentiment lexicons (e.g. SentiWordNet) for realizing use cases such as prediction of clinical outcomes; others proposed new domain-specific sentiment analysis approaches based on machine learning. Accuracy values between 71.5–88.2% are reported. Data used for evaluation and test are often retrieved from MIMIC databases or i2b2 challenges. Latest developments related to artificial neural networks are not yet fully considered in this domain. We conclude that future research should focus on developing a gold standard sentiment lexicon, adapted to the specific characteristics of clinical narratives. Efforts have to be made to either augment existing or create new high-quality labeled data sets of clinical narratives. Last, the suitability of state-of-the-art machine learning methods for natural language processing and in particular transformer-based models should be investigated for their application for sentiment analysis of clinical narratives.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients' rights are integral to medical ethics. This study aimed to perform sentiment analysis and opinion mining on patients' messages by a combination of lexicon-based and machine learning methods to identify positive or negative comments and to determine the different ward and staff names mentioned in patients' messages. METHODS: The level of satisfaction and observance of the rights of 250 service recipients of the hospital was evaluated through the related checklists by the evaluator. In total, 822 Persian messages, composed of 540 negative and 282 positive comments, were collected and labeled by the evaluator. Pre-processing was performed on the messages and followed by 2 feature vectors which were extracted from the messages, including the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) vector and a combination of the multifeature (MF) (a lexicon-based method) and TFIDF (MF + TFIDF) vectors. Six feature selectors and 5 classifiers were used in this study. For the evaluations, 5-fold cross-validation with different metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), F1 score, sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and Precision-Recall Curves (PRC) were reported. Message tag detection, which featured different hospital wards and identified staff names mentioned in the study patients' messages, was implemented by the lexicon-based method. RESULTS: The best classifier was Multinomial Naïve Bayes in combination with MF + TFIDF feature vector and SelectFromModel (SFM) feature selection (ACC = 0.89 ± 0.03, AUC = 0.87 ± 0.03, F1 = 0.92 ± 0.03, SEN = 0.93 ± 0.04, and SPE = 0.82 ± 0.02, PRC-AUC = 0.97). Two methods of assessment by the evaluator and artificial intelligence as well as survey systems were compared. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that the lexicon-based method, in combination with machine learning classifiers, could extract sentiments in patients' comments and classify them into positive and negative categories. We also developed an online survey system to analyze patients' satisfaction in different wards and to remove conventional assessments by the evaluator.},

   abstract = {Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to review the products that they have purchased and the associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. It also makes it difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. For the manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell the same product and the manufacturer normally produces many kinds of products. In this research, we aim to mine and to summarize all the customer reviews of a product. This summarization task is different from traditional text summarization because we only mine the features of the product on which the customers have expressed their opinions and whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. Our task is performed in three steps: (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. This paper proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. Our experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.},

   abstract = {Opinion mining, or sentiment analysis, is a field in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It extracts people’s thoughts, including assessments, attitudes, and emotions toward individuals, topics, and events. The task is technically challenging but incredibly useful. With the explosive growth of the digital platform in cyberspace, such as blogs and social networks, individuals and organisations are increasingly utilising public opinion for their decision-making. In recent years, significant research concerning mining people’s sentiments based on text in cyberspace using opinion mining has been explored. Researchers have applied numerous opinions mining techniques, including machine learning and lexicon-based approach to analyse and classify people’s sentiments based on a text and discuss the existing gap. Thus, it creates a research opportunity for other researchers to investigate and propose improved methods and new domain applications to fill the gap. In this paper, a structured literature review has been done by considering 122 articles to examine all relevant research accomplished in the field of opinion mining application and the suggested Kansei approach to solve the challenges that occur in mining sentiments based on text in cyberspace. Five different platforms database were systematically searched between 2015 and 2021: ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), IEEE (Advancing Technology for Humanity), SCIENCE DIRECT, SpringerLink, and SCOPUS. This study analyses various techniques of opinion mining as well as the Kansei approach that will help to enhance techniques in mining people’s sentiment and emotion in cyberspace. Most of the study addressed methods including machine learning, lexicon-based approach, hybrid approach, and Kansei approach in mining the sentiment and emotion based on text. The possible societal impacts of the current opinion mining technique, including machine learning and the Kansei approach, along with major trends and challenges, are highlighted. Various applications of opinion mining techniques in mining people’s sentiment and emotion according to the objective of the research, used method, dataset, summarized in this study. This study serves as a theoretical analysis of the opinion mining method complemented by the Kansei approach in classifying people’s sentiments based on text in cyberspace. Kansei approach can measure people’s impressions using artefacts based on senses including sight, feeling and cognition reported precise results for the assessment of human emotion. Therefore, this research suggests that the Kansei approach should be a complementary factor including in the development of a dictionary focusing on emotion in the national security domain. Also, this theoretical analysis will act as a reference to researchers regarding the Kansei approach as one of the techniques to improve hybrid approaches in opinion mining.},

@article{Jiang2023,
   abstract = {As a popular research field of sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis focuses on the emotional expression in different aspects. However, the current research is not precise enough in dividing the aspects of sentiment analysis. The problem of semantic overlap between aspects occurs. Furthermore, in many cases, one aspect may be contained in several sub-aspects. When the study only focused on the emotion tends in one or several sub-aspects, the results of sentiment analysis may be distorted. To deal with these problems, we propose the concept of non-dependent aspects by analyzing the dependencies among aspects and a method for dividing non-dependent aspects. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that our proposed sentiment analysis results based on non-dependent aspects are more accurate than the original one, and non-dependent aspects can be easily transferred to a new corpus. The experiments on real-world data are also supporting the results of theoretical analysis. The range of accuracy of non-dependent aspects is improved by 1.9%–13.4% than before.},

@article{Gandhi2023,
   abstract = {Sentiment analysis (SA) has gained much traction In the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). There is growing demand to automate analysis of user sentiment towards products or services. Opinions are increasingly being shared online in the form of videos rather than text alone. This has led to SA using multiple modalities, termed Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), becoming an important research area. MSA utilises latest advancements in machine learning and deep learning at various stages including for multimodal feature extraction and fusion and sentiment polarity detection, with aims to minimize error rate and improve performance. This survey paper examines primary taxonomy and newly released multimodal fusion architectures. Recent developments in MSA architectures are divided into ten categories, namely early fusion, late fusion, hybrid fusion, model-level fusion, tensor fusion, hierarchical fusion, bi-modal fusion, attention-based fusion, quantum-based fusion and word-level fusion. A comparison of several architectural evolutions in terms of MSA fusion categories and their relative strengths and limitations are presented. Finally, a number of interdisciplinary applications and future research directions are proposed.},
