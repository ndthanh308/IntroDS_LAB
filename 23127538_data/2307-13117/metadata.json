  "abstract": "Revisiting the Coon amplitude, a deformation of the Veneziano amplitude with a logarithmic generalization of linear Regge trajectories, we scrutinize its potential origins in a worldsheet theory by proposing a definition of its $q$-deformation through the integral representation of the $q$-beta function. By utilizing $q$-deformed commutation relations and vertex operators, we derive the Coon amplitude within the framework of the dual resonance model. We extend this to the open-string context by $q$-deforming the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$, resulting in a well-defined $q$-deformed open superstring amplitude. We further demonstrate that the $q$-prefactor in the Coon amplitude arises naturally from the property of the $q$-integral. Furthermore, we find that two different types of $q$-prefactors, corresponding to different representations of the same scattering amplitude, are essentially the same by leveraging the properties of $q$-numbers. Our findings indicate that the $q$-deformed string amplitude defines a continuous family of amplitudes, illustrating how string amplitudes with a finite $α^\\prime$ uniquely flow to the amplitudes of scalar scattering in field theory at energy scale $Λ$ as $q$ changes from $1$ to $0$. This happens without the requirement of an $α^\\prime$ expansion, presenting a fresh perspective on the connection between string and field theories.",
