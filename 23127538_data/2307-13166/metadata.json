  "abstract": "Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show great promise as absorber materials in high-specific-power (i.e. high-power-per-weight) solar cells, due to their high optical absorption, desirable band gaps, and self-passivated surfaces. However, the ultimate performance limits of TMD solar cells remain unknown today. Here, we establish the efficiency limits of multilayer MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 solar cells under AM 1.5 G illumination as a function of TMD film thickness and material quality. We use an extended version of the detailed balance method which includes Auger and defect-assisted Shockley-Reed-Hall recombination mechanisms in addition to radiative losses, calculated from measured optical absorption spectra. We demonstrate that single-junction solar cells with TMD films as thin as 50 nm could in practice achieve up to 25% power conversion efficiency with the currently available material quality, making them an excellent choice for high-specific-power photovoltaics.",
