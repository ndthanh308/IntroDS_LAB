  "abstract": "We use the QCD instanton vacuum model to discuss the emergence of the light scalar and vector mesons on the light front. We take into account both the instanton and anti-instanton single and molecular interactions on the light quarks, in the form of non-local effective interactions. Although the molecular induced interactions are suppressed by a power of the packing fraction, they are still sufficient to bind the vector mesons, while keeping most of the scalar spectrum relatively unchanged. We explicitly derive the light front distribution amplitudes (DAs) and partonic functions (PDFs) for the scalar and vector mesons, and compare them after pertinent QCD evolution, to the available empirical and lattice measured counterparts. The Dirac electric form factors for both the pion and rho meson are derived, and shown to compare well with current data.",
