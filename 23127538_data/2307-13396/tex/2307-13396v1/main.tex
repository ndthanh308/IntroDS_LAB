\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
  This paper discusses the problem of efficiently solving parity games where player \Odd~has to obey an additional \emph{strong transition fairness constraint} on its vertices -- given that a player \Odd~vertex $v$ is visited infinitely often, a particular subset of the outgoing edges (called \emph{live edges}) of $v$ has to be taken infinitely often. Such games, which we call \emph{\Odd-fair parity games}, naturally arise from abstractions of cyber-physical systems for planning and control. 

  In this paper, we present a new Zielonka-type algorithm for solving \Odd-fair parity games. This algorithm not only shares \emph{the same worst-case time complexity} as Zielonka's algorithm for (normal) parity games but also preserves the algorithmic advantage Zielonka's algorithm possesses over other parity solvers with exponential time complexity. %, such as the recently introduced \emph{fixed-point algorithm} for \Odd-fair parity games by Banerjee et. al.~\cite{banerjee2022fast}.
 
 We additionally introduce a formalization of \Odd~player winning strategies in such games, which were unexplored previous to this work. %To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a formalization has been introduced.  %We represent these strategies as \enquote{almost positional} strategy templates, and prove their existence from all player \Odd~winning vertices. 
 This formalization serves dual purposes: firstly, it enables us to prove our Zielonka-type algorithm; secondly, it stands as a noteworthy contribution in its own right, augmenting our understanding of additional fairness assumptions in two-player games.\end{abstract}
