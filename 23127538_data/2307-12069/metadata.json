  "abstract": "Recently LHCb experimental group find an exotic state $T^+_{cc}$ from the process $p\\bar{p} \\to D^0D^0π^+ + X$. A key question is if it is just a molecule or may have confined tetraquark ingredient. To investigate this, different methods are taken, including two channel ($D^{*+}D^0$ and $D^{*0}D^+$) K-matrix unitarization and single channel Flatté-like parametrization method analysed by pole counting rule and spectral density function sum rule. It demonstrates that $T^+_{cc}$ is a molecular state, though the possibility that there may exist elementary ingredient can not be excluded, by rough analysis on its production rate.",
