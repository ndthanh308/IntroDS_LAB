  "abstract": "Let $G_{n,γ}$ be the set of all connected graphs on $n$ vertices with domination number $γ$. A graph is called a minimizer graph if it attains the minimum spectral radius among $G_{n,γ}$. Very recently, Liu, Li and Xie [Linear Algebra and its Applications 673 (2023) 233--258] proved that the minimizer graph over all graphs in $\\mathbb{G}_{n,γ}$ must be a tree. Moreover, they determined the minimizer graph among $G_{n,\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor}$ for even $n$, and posed the conjecture on the minimizer graph among $G_{n,\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor}$ for odd $n$. In this paper, we disprove the conjecture and completely determine the unique minimizer graph among $G_{n,\\lfloor\\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor}$ for odd $n$.",
