  "abstract": "The aim of this chapter is to identify and characterise the pedagogical model prescribed for this particular mathematics teaching delivered in post-primary vocational training. More specifically, the contribution investigates two major questions: what specificities, proximities, differences with the pedagogical models of mathematics teaching for elementary primary and secondary? How should this mathematics teaching be operationalised, particularly with regard to the specific characteristics of the public for whom it is intended?",
