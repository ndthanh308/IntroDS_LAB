  "abstract": "In this article we study the problem of nonlinear Landau damping for the Vlasov-Poisson equations on the torus. As our main result we show that for perturbations initially of size $ε>0$ and time intervals $(0,ε^{-N})$ one obtains nonlinear stability in regularity classes larger than Gevrey $3$, uniformly in $ε$. As a complementary result we construct families of Sobolev regular initial data which exhibit nonlinear Landau damping. Our proof is based on the methods of Grenier, Nguyen and Rodnianski.",
