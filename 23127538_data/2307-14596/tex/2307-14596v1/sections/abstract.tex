Traffic forecasting, which aims to predict traffic conditions based on historical observations, has been an enduring research topic and is widely recognized as an essential component of intelligent transportation.

% As a crucial part of intelligent transportation systems, traffic forecasting, which aims to predict traffic conditions based on historical observations, has been an enduring research topic.
% 
Recent proposals on Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks~(STGNNs) have made significant progress by combining sequential models with graph convolution networks. 
% 
However, due to high complexity issues, STGNNs only focus on short-term traffic forecasting, \eg 1-hour forecasting, while ignoring more practical long-term forecasting. 
% 
{\color{black}In this paper}, we make the first attempt to explore long-term traffic forecasting, \eg 1-day forecasting. 
% 
{\color{black}To this end, we first} reveal its unique challenges in exploiting multi-scale representations.
Then, we propose a novel \textit{Hierarchical U-net TransFormer}~(HUTFormer) to address the issues of long-term traffic forecasting.

% and make accurate predictions.
% 
HUTFormer consists of a hierarchical encoder and decoder to jointly \textit{generate} and \textit{utilize} multi-scale representations of traffic data.
% jointly captures local and global dynamics in long-term traffic data. 
Specifically, for the encoder, we {\color{black}propose} window self-attention and segment merging to extract multi-scale representations from long-term traffic data. 
For the decoder, we design a cross-scale attention mechanism to effectively incorporate multi-scale representations. 
% 
In addition, HUTFormer employs an efficient input embedding strategy to address the complexity issues.
% , which consists of segment embedding and spatial-temporal positional encoding. 
% 
Extensive experiments on four traffic datasets show that the proposed HUTFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art traffic forecasting and long time series forecasting baselines.
