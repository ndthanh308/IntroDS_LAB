  "abstract": "We present a method for identifying $H\\rightarrow WW^* \\rightarrow \\ell νj j$ in the presence of large Standard Model backgrounds and illustrate how this decay mode may be applied to the study of Bell-type Inequalities. Our findings reveal the feasibility of complete reconstruction of such Higgs decays and the efficacy of our suggested combination of selection criteria in effectively mitigating the otherwise overwhelming backgrounds. Our approach is based on a combination of bottom and charm tagging, alongside innovative reconstruction techniques. A realistic simulation based on publicly available object identification, reconstruction, and tagging efficiencies from the ATLAS experiment is used to explore the potential sensitivity to violations of the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) inequality in existing and expected future data collected at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is found that, the proposed method provides a powerful means of distinguishing the Higgs decay mode from the background, allowing us to achieve an expectation of approximately 3$σ$ significance in detecting violations of these inequalities with 300 $fb^{-1}$ of data, soon-to-be collected by LHC.",
