  "abstract": "There is a significant need for the generation of virtual histological information from coronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) images to better guide the treatment of coronary artery disease. However, existing methods either require a large pixel-wisely paired training dataset or have limited capability to map pathological regions. To address these issues, we proposed a structural constrained, pathology aware, transformer generative adversarial network, namely SCPAT-GAN, to generate virtual stained H&E histology from OCT images. The proposed SCPAT-GAN advances existing methods via a novel design to impose pathological guidance on structural layers using transformer-based network.",
