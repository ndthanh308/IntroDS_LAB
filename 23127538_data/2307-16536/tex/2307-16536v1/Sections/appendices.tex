% The \appendix command is used to start a single appendix.
% An optional argument can be used to specify a title:
% \appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% After issuing \appendix, the \section command will be
% disabled and any attempt to use \section will be ignored
% and will cause a warning message to be generated. (The
% single appendix marks the end of the enumerated sections
% and the section counter is fixed at zero—one does not state
% “see Appendix A” when there is only one appendix, instead
% “see the Appendix” is used.) However, all lower \subsecti
% on commands and the \section* form will work as normal
% as these may still be needed for things like acknowledgments.
\appendices
% is used when there is more than one appendix
% section. \section is then used to declare each appendix:
% \section{Proof of the First Zonklar Equation}

% The mandatory argument to section can be left blank (\sect
% ion{}) if no title is desired. It is important to remember to
% declare a section before any additional subsections or labels
% that refer to section (or subsection, etc.) numbers. As with \appendix, the \section* command and the lower \subsection commands will still work as usual.

% Some authors prefer to have the appendix number to be part
% of equation numbers for equations that appear in an appendix.
% This can be accomplished by redefining the equation numbers
% as
\renewcommand{\theequation}{\thesection.\arabic{equation}}
% before the first appendix equation. For a single appendix, the
% constant “A” should be used in place of \thesection.
