\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we studied a cooperative multi-agent constrained POMDP in the setting of infinite-horizon expected total discounted costs. We established strong-duality and existence of a saddle point using Sion's Minimax Theorem -- by giving a suitable topology to the space of all possible policy-profiles and then establishing lower semi-continuity of the Lagrangian function. Then, we laid out the characterization of a universal compression-framework that is independent of the Lagrange-multipliers vector -- therefore easing the learning of the compression-mappings in the learning context. Based on the said compression-framework, we then designed a primal-dual MARL framework based on CTDE and three timescale stochastic approximation with neural-networks for function-approximation.

The theoretical results in this work are the first of its kind and will hopefully encourage investigation of MA-C-POMDPs in more general settings. Furthermore, an empirical evaluation of the proposed primal-dual MARL framework (an extension of single-agent REINFORCE algorithm~\cite{sutton98}) or its actor-critic variants is also an interesting direction.
