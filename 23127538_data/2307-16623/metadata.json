  "abstract": "The structural and magnetic properties of the as-cast and annealed V$_{0.6-x}$Si$_x$Ti$_{0.4}$ ($x$ = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) alloy superconductors are reported here. It is found that addition of silicon to the V-Ti alloys results in eutectic precipitation of Ti$_{5}$Si$_3$-phase in the body centred cubic (bcc) $β$-V-Ti matrix. In the as-cast V$_{0.6-x}$Si$_x$Ti$_{0.4}$ alloys, the superconducting transition temperature (T$_{C}$) changes non-monotonically with increasing silicon content whereas after annealing, it is about 7.7 K for all the alloys. On the other hand, the upper critical field decreases and the coherence length increases after annealing in the x = 0.10 alloy. The variations in the superconducting properties in the alloys are related to the solubility of 6 at.% Si in the V$_{0.60}$Ti$_{0.40}$ alloy and the vanadium enrichment in the $β$ matrix due to the precipitation of Ti$_{5}$Si$_3$ phase.",
