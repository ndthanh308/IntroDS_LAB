  "abstract": "The aim of blind super-resolution (SR) in computer vision is to improve the resolution of an image without prior knowledge of the degradation process that caused the image to be low-resolution. The State of the Art (SOTA) model Real-ESRGAN has advanced perceptual loss and produced visually compelling outcomes using more complex degradation models to simulate real-world degradations. However, there is still room to improve the super-resolved quality of Real-ESRGAN by implementing recent techniques. This research paper introduces StarSRGAN, a novel GAN model designed for blind super-resolution tasks that utilize 5 various architectures. Our model provides new SOTA performance with roughly 10% better on the MANIQA and AHIQ measures, as demonstrated by experimental comparisons with Real-ESRGAN. In addition, as a compact version, StarSRGAN Lite provides approximately 7.5 times faster reconstruction speed (real-time upsampling from 540p to 4K) but can still keep nearly 90% of image quality, thereby facilitating the development of a real-time SR experience for future research.
