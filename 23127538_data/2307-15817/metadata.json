  "abstract": "For any $n$-dimensional simplex in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\\ge 4$, it is asked that if a continuous deformation preserves the volumes of all the codimension 2 faces, then is it necessarily a \\emph{rigid} motion. While the question remains open and the general belief is that the answer is affirmative, for all $n\\ge 4$, we provide counterexamples to a variant of the question where $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is replaced by a pseudo-Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{p,n-p}$ for some unspecified $p\\ge 2$.",
