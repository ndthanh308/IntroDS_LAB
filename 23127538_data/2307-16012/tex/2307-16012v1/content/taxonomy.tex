% \section{Terminology}
% In this section, we summarize the terminologies adopted in this work.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textit{Non-target trial}: The enrollment and testing utterances belong to two different speakers.
%     \item \textit{Target trial}: The enrollment and testing utterances belong to the same speaker.
%     \item \textit{Target system}: The system that attackers attempt to attack.
%     \item \textit{Substitute system}: The system that is used for approximating gradients for adversarial sample generation when the target system is unavailable to attackers.
%     % \item \textit{White-box attack}: Attackers use the target system directly to generate adversarial samples
%     % \item \textit{Black-box attack}: Attackers use a substitute system to generate adversarial samples
%     \item \textit{False acceptance rate (FAR)}: The percentage of non-target trials in which unauthorised persons are incorrectly accepted.
%     \item \textit{False rejection rate (FRR)}: The percentage of target trials where authorised persons are incorrectly rejected.
%     \item \textit{Equal error rate (EER)}: The error rate under the operation point where FAR equals to FRR.
