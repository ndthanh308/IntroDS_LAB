  "abstract": "In this paper, one can explicitly see the process of implementing the robust residual generator on digital domain, especially on FPGA. Firstly, the baseline model is developed in double precision floating point format. To develop the baseline model, key parameters such as SNR and detection window length are selected in the identification stage. (Please refer to the uploaded paper because this box doesn't accept more typing beyond this point)",
