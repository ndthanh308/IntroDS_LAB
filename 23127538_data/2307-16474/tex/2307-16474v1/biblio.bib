    abstract = {In this work we show that the flexibility of the discontinuous Galerkin (dG) discretization can be fruitfully exploited to implement numerical solution strategies based on the use of elements with very general shapes. Thanks to the freedom in defining the mesh topology, we propose a new h-adaptive technique based on agglomeration coarsening of a fine mesh. The possibility to enhance the error distribution over the computational domain is investigated on a Poisson problem with the goal of obtaining a mesh independent discretization. The main building block of our dG method consists of defining discrete polynomial spaces directly on physical frame elements. For this purpose we orthonormalize with respect to the L2-product a set of monomials relocated in a specific element frame and we introduce an easy way to reduce the cost related to numerical integration on agglomerated meshes. To complete the dG formulation for second order problems, two extensions of the BR2 scheme to arbitrary polyhedral grids, including an estimate of the stabilization parameter ensuring the coercivity property, are here proposed.}

    abstract = { We present, on the simplest possible case, what we consider as the very basic features of the (brand new) virtual element method. As the readers will easily recognize, the virtual element method could easily be regarded as the ultimate evolution of the mimetic finite differences approach. However, in their last step they became so close to the traditional finite elements that we decided to use a different perspective and a different name. Now the virtual element spaces are just like the usual finite element spaces with the addition of suitable non-polynomial functions. This is far from being a new idea. See for instance the very early approach of E. Wachspress [A Rational Finite Element Basic (Academic Press, 1975)] or the more recent overview of T.-P. Fries and T. Belytschko [The extended/generalized finite element method: An overview of the method and its applications, Int. J. Numer. Methods Engrg.84 (2010) 253–304]. The novelty here is to take the spaces and the degrees of freedom in such a way that the elementary stiffness matrix can be computed without actually computing these non-polynomial functions, but just using the degrees of freedom. In doing that we can easily deal with complicated element geometries and/or higher-order continuity conditions (like C1, C2, etc.). The idea is quite general, and could be applied to a number of different situations and problems. Here however we want to be as clear as possible, and to present the simplest possible case that still gives the flavor of the whole idea. }

For badly shaped elements the construction of the projection matrices required for assembling the local coefficients of the linear system within the VEM discretization of Partial Differential Equations can result very ill conditioned. The proposed approach can be easily implemented within an existing VEM code in order to reduce the possible ill conditioning of the elemental projection matrices. Numerical results applied to an hydro-geological flow simulation that often produces very badly shaped elements show a clear improvement of the quality of the numerical solution, confirming the viability of the approach. The method can be conveniently combined with a classical implementation of the VEM and applied element-wise, thus requiring a rather moderate additional numerical cost.}

abstract = {Strongly anisotropic diffusion equations require special techniques to overcome or reduce the mesh locking phenomenon. We present a finite volume scheme that tries to approximate with the best possible accuracy the quantities that are of importance in discretizing anisotropic fluxes. In particular, we discuss the crucial role of accurate evaluations of the tangential components of the gradient acting tangentially to the control volume boundaries, that are called into play by anisotropic diffusion tensors. To obtain the sought characteristics from the proposed finite volume method, we employ a second-order accurate reconstruction scheme which is used to evaluate both normal and tangential cell-interface gradients. The experimental results on a number of different meshes show that the scheme maintains optimal convergence rates in both L2 and H1 norms except for the benchmark test considering full Neumann boundary conditions on non-uniform grids. In such a case, a severe locking effect is experienced and documented. However, within the range of practical values of the anisotropy ratio, the scheme is robust and efficient. We postulate and verify experimentally the existence of a quadratic relationship between the anisotropy ratio and the mesh size parameter that guarantees optimal and sub-optimal convergence rates.}

abstract = {In this paper, we present the Virtual Element Method (VEM) for the solution of strongly anisotropic diffusion equations. In the VEM, the bilinear form associated with the diffusion equations is decomposed into two parts: a consistency term and a stability term. Therefore, the local stiffness matrix is the sum of two matrices: a consistency matrix and a stability matrix. Both matrices are constructed by using suitable projection operators that are computable from the degrees of freedom. The VEM stiffness matrix becomes very ill-conditioned in presence of a strong anisotropy of the diffusion tensor coefficient, leading to a loss of convergence, an effect known in the literature as mesh locking. In this work, we compare different choices of the stabilization, the basis functions and the elliptic projection operator, in order to alleviate the mesh locking phenomenon. To this end, we use orthonormal basis functions for the space of polynomials of degree k and an elliptic projection operator that is weighted with respect to the diffusion tensor. Moreover, the VEM with k=1 needs a particular treatment to avoid locking. Numerical experiments with different values of k confirm the validity of the proposed approach.}

Curved triangles or quadrangles are used to discretize the poloidal plane of the machine, while a structured discretization is used in the toroidal direction. The proper design of the numerical fluxes guarantees the correct convergence order at any anisotropy level. Computations performed on well-designed 2D and 3D numerical tests show that non-aligned discretizations are able to provide spurious diffusion free solutions as long as high-order interpolations are used. Introducing an explicit measure of the numerical diffusion, a careful investigation is carried out showing an exponential increase of this latest with respect to the non-alignment of the mesh with the diffusion direction, as well as an exponential decrease with the polynomial degree of interpolation. A brief assessment of the method with respect to two finite-difference schemes using non-aligned discretization, but classically used in fusion modeling, is also presented.

The flexible nature of unstructured grids, however, allows for the orientation of the grid to align locally with the dominant flow direction and thus decrease numerical diffusion. We investigate the relationship between grid alignment and diffusive errors in the context of scalar transport in a triangular, unstructured, 3-D hydrodynamic code. Analytical results are presented for the 2-D anisotropic numerical diffusion tensor and verified against idealized simulations. Results from two physically realistic estuarine simulations, differing only in grid alignment, show significant changes in gradients of salinity. Changes in scalar gradients are reflective of reduced numerical diffusion interacting with the complex 3-D structure of the transporting flow. We also describe a method for utilizing flow fields from an unaligned grid to generate a flow-aligned grid with minimal supervision. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Russo, Basic principles of virtual element methods, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 23 (2013) 199–214]), we use here, in a systematic way, the L2-projection operators as designed in [B. Ahmad, A. Alsaedi, F. Brezzi, L. D. Marini and A. Russo, Equivalent projectors for virtual element methods, Comput. Math. Appl. 66 (2013) 376–391]. In particular, the present method does not reduce to the original Virtual Element Method of [L. Beirão da Veiga, F. Brezzi, A. Cangiani, G. Manzini, L. D. Marini and A. Russo, Basic principles of virtual element methods, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 23 (2013) 199–214] for simpler problems as the classical Laplace operator (apart from the lowest-order cases). Numerical experiments show the accuracy and the robustness of the method, and they show as well that a simple-minded extension of the method in [L. Beirão da Veiga, F. Brezzi, A. Cangiani, G. Manzini, L. D. Marini and A. Russo, Basic principles of virtual element methods, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 23 (2013) 199–214] to the case of variable coefficients produces, in general, sub-optimal results. }

abstract = {We present numerical tests of the virtual element method (VEM) tailored for the discretization of a three dimensional Poisson problem with high-order “polynomial” degree (up to p=10). Besides, we discuss possible reasons for which the method could return suboptimal/wrong error convergence curves. Among these motivations, we highlight ill-conditioning of the stiffness matrix and not particularly “clever” choices of the stabilizations. We propose variants of the definition of face/bulk degrees of freedom, as well as of stabilizations, which lead to methods that are much more robust in terms of numerical performances.}
