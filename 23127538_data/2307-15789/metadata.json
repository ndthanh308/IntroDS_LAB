  "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the asymptotic behavior of weak solutions for non-autonomous diffusion equations with delay in time-dependent spaces when the nonlinear function $f$ is critical growth, the delay term $g(t, u_t)$ contains some hereditary characteristics and the external force $h \\in L_{l o c}^{2}\\left(\\mathbb{R} ; L^{2}(Ω)\\right)$. Firstly, we prove the well-posedness of solutions by using the Faedo-Galerkin approximation method. Then after a series of elaborate energy estimates and calculations, we establish the existence and regularity of pullback attractors in time-dependent spaces $C_{\\mathcal{H}_{t}(Ω)}$ and $C_{\\mathcal{H}^{1}_{t}(Ω)}$ respectively.",
