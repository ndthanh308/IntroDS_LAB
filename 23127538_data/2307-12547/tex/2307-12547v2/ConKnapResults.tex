\section{\pa}
We present our results for \pa in this section. First, we show that \pa is strongly \NPC by reducing it from \vc, which is known to be \NPC even for $3$-regular graphs~\cite[folklore]{DBLP:journals/dm/FleischnerSS10}. Hence, we do not expect a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for \pa, unlike \kp.

\begin{definition}[\vc]Given a graph $\GG=(\VV,\EE)$ and a positive integer $k$, compute if there exists a subset $\VV' \subseteq \VV$ such that at least one end-point of every edge belongs to $\VV'$ and $|\VV'|\leq k$. We denote an arbitrary instance of \vc by $(\GG,k)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:pa-gen-npc}
\pa is strongly \NPC even when the maximum degree of the input graph is four.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Clearly, \pa $\in$ \NP. We reduce \vc to \pa to prove NP-hardness. Let $(\GG=(\VV=\{v_i: i\in[n]\},\EE),$ $k)$ be an arbitrary instance of \vc where \GG is $3$-regular. We construct the following instance $(\GG^\pr=(\VV^\pr,\EE^\pr),(w(u))_{u\in\VV},(\alpha(u))_{u\in\VV},s,d)$ of \pa.
    \begin{align*}
        &\VV^\pr = \{u_i, g_i: i\in[n]\} \cup \{h_e: e\in \EE\}\\
        &\EE^\pr = \{\{u_i,h_e\}: i\in[n], e \in\EE, e\text{ is incident on }v_i\text{ in }\GG\} \\
        &\cup \{\{u_i,g_i\}: i\in[n]\} \cup \{\{g_i,g_{i+1}\}:i \in [n-1]\}\\
        &w(u_i) = 1, \alpha(u_i)=0, w(g_i)=0, \alpha(g_i)=0, \forall i\in[n]\\
        &w(h_e)=0, \alpha(h_e)=1, \forall e\in\EE, s=k, d=|\EE|
    \end{align*}
    We observe that the maximum degree of $\GG^\pr$ is at most four --- (i) the degree of $u_i$ is four for every $i\in[n]$, since \GG is $3$-regular and $u_i$ has an edge to $g_i$, (ii) the degree of $h_e$ is two for every $e\in\EE$, and (iii) the degree of $g_i$ is at most three for every $i\in[n]$ since the set $\{g_i:i\in[n]\}$ induces a path. We claim that the two instances are equivalent.

    In one direction, let us suppose that the \vc instance is a \yes instance. Let $\WW\subseteq\VV$ be a vertex cover of \GG with $|\WW|\le k$. We consider $\UU=\{u_i: i\in[n],v_i\in\WW\}\cup\{g_i: i\in[n]\}\cup\{h_e: e\in\EE\}\subseteq \VV^\pr$. We claim that $\GG^\pr[\UU]$ is connected. Since $\{g_i:i\in[n]\}$ induces a path and there is an edge between $u_i$ and $g_i$ for every $i\in[n]$, the induced subgraph $\GG^\pr[\{u_i: i\in[n],v_i\in\WW\}\cup\{g_i: i\in[n]\}]$ is connected. Since \WW is a vertex cover of \GG, every edge $e\in\EE$ is incident on at least one vertex in \WW. Hence, every vertex $h_e, e\in\EE,$ has an edge with at least one vertex in $\{u_i: i\in[n],v_i\in\WW\}$ in the graph $\GG^\pr$. Hence, the induced subgraph $\GG^\pr[\UU]$ is connected. Now we have $w(\UU)=\sum_{i=1}^n w(u_i)\mathbbm{1}(u_i\in\UU) + \sum_{i=1}^n w(g_i) + \sum_{e\in\EE} w(h_e)=|\UU|\le k$. We also have $\alpha(\UU)=\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha(u_i)\mathbbm{1}(u_i\in\UU) + \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha(g_i) + \sum_{e\in\EE} \alpha(h_e)=|\EE|$. Hence, the \pa instance is also a \yes instance.

    In the other direction, let us assume that the \pa instance is a \yes instance. Let $\UU\subseteq\VV^\pr$ be a solution of the \pa instance. We consider $\WW=\{v_i: i\in[n]: u_i\in\UU\}$. Since $s=k$, we have $|\WW|\le k$. Also, since $d=|\EE|$, we have $\{h_e: e\in\EE\}\subseteq\UU$. We claim that \WW is a vertex cover of \GG. Suppose not, then there exists an edge $e\in\EE$ which is not covered by \WW. Then none of the neighbors of $h_e$ belongs to \UU contradicting our assumption that \UU is a solution and thus $\GG^\pr[\UU]$ should be connected. Hence, \WW is a vertex cover of \GG and thus the \vc instance is a \yes instance.

    We observe that all the numbers in our reduced \pa instance are at most the number of edges of the graph. Hence, our reduction shows that \pa is strongly \NPC.
\end{proof}

 \Cref{thm:pa-gen-npc} also implies the following corollary in the framework of parameterized complexity.

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:pa-max-deg}
    \pa is \PNPH parameterized by the maximum degree of the input graph.
\end{corollary}

We next show that \pa is \NPC even for trees. For that, we reduce from the \NPC problem \kp.

\begin{definition}[\kp]
Given a set $\XX=[n]$ of $n$ items with sizes $\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n,$ values $p_1,\ldots,p_n$, capacity $b$ and target value $q$, compute if there exists a subset $\II \subseteq [n]$ such that $\sum_{i\in \II} \theta_i \leq b$ and $\sum_{i\in \II} p_i \geq q$. We denote an arbitrary instance of \kp by $(\XX,(\theta_i)_{i\in\XX}, (p_i)_{i\in\XX}, b,q)$.
\end{definition}


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:pa-star-npc}
	\pa is \NPC even for star graphs.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\pa clearly belongs to \NP. To show \NP-hardness, we reduce from \kp. Let $(\XX=[n],(\theta_i)_{i\in\XX}, (p_i)_{i\in\XX}, b,q)$ be an arbitrary instance of \kp. We consider the following instance $(\GG(\VV,\EE),(w(u))_{u\in\VV},(\alpha(u))_{u\in\VV},s,d)$ of \pa.
\begin{align*}
    &\VV = \{v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n\}\\
    &\EE = \{\{v_0,v_i\}: 1\le i\le n\}\\
    &w(v_i) = \theta_i\, \alpha(v_i) = p_i;\forall i\in[n], w(v_0)=\alpha(v_0)=0;\\
    &s = b, d = q
\end{align*}
We now claim that the two instances are equivalent.

In one direction, let us suppose that the \kp instance is a \yes instance. Let $\WW\subseteq\XX$ be a solution of \kp. Let us consider $\UU=\{v_i: i\in\WW\}\cup\{v_0\}\subseteq\VV$. We observe that $\GG[\UU]$ is connected since $v_0\in\UU$. We also have
\[ w(\UU) = \sum_{i\in\WW} w(v_i) = \sum_{i\in\WW} \theta_i \le b = s,\]
and
\[ \alpha(\UU) = \sum_{i\in\WW} \alpha(v_i) = \sum_{i\in\WW} p_i \ge q = d.\]
Hence, the \pa instance is a \yes instance.

In the other direction, let us assume that the \pa instance is a \yes instance with $\UU\subseteq\VV$ be one of its solution. Let us consider a set $\WW=\{i: i\in[n], v_i\in\UU\}$. We now have
\[ \sum_{i\in\WW} \theta_i = \sum_{i\in\WW} w(v_i) = w(\UU) \le s = b, \]
and
\[ \sum_{i\in\WW} p_i = \sum_{i\in\WW} \alpha(v_i) = \alpha(\UU) \ge d=q.\]
Hence, the \kp instance is a \yes instance.
\end{proof}


We complement the hardness result in \Cref{thm:pa-star-npc} by designing a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for \pa for trees. In fact, we have designed an algorithm with running time $2^{\OO(\tw\log \tw)}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\cdot {\sf min}\{s^2,d^2\}$ where the treewidth of the input graph is $\tw$. We present this algorithm next.

\subsection{Treewidth as a Parameter}
\input{bdtw}

\subsection{A Fixed Parameter Fully Pseudo-polynomial Time Approximation Scheme}

We now use the algorithm in \Cref{thm:treewidth-pa} as a black-box to design an $(1-\eps)$-factor approximation algorithm for optimizing the value of the solution and running in time $2^{\tw\log \tw}\cdot \text{poly}(n,1/\eps)$.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm-fptas}
There is an $(1-\eps)$-factor approximation algorithm for \pa for optimizing the value of the solution and running in time $2^{\OO(\tw\log \tw)}\cdot \text{poly}(n,1/\eps)$ where \tw is the treewidth of the input graph.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\II=(\GG=(\VV,\EE),(w(u))_{u\in\VV},(\alpha(u))_{u\in\VV},s)$ be an arbitrary instance of \pa where the goal is to output a connected subgraph \UU of maximum $\alpha(\UU)$ subject to the constraint that $w(\UU)\le s$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $w(u)\le s$ for every $u\in\VV$. If not, then we can remove every $u\in\VV$ whose $w(u)>s$; this does not affect any solution since any vertex deleted can never be part of any solution. Let $\alpha_{\text{max}}=\max\{\alpha(u): u\in\VV\}$. We construct another instance $\II^\pr=\left(\GG=(\VV,\EE),(w(u))_{u\in\VV},(\alpha^\pr(u)=\left\lfloor \frac{n\alpha(u)}{\eps\alpha_{\text{max}}}\right\rfloor)_{u\in\VV},s\right)$ of \pa. We compute the optimal solution $\WW^\pr\subseteq\VV$ of $\II^\pr$ using the algorithm in \Cref{thm:treewidth-pa} and output $\WW^\pr$. Let $\WW\subseteq\VV$ be an optimal solution of $\II$. Clearly $\WW^\pr$ is a valid (may not be optimal) solution of \II also, since $w(\WW^\pr)\le s$ by the correctness of the algorithm in \Cref{thm:treewidth-pa}. We now prove the approximation factor of our algorithm.
\begin{align*}
     \sum_{u\in\WW^\pr}\alpha(u) &\ge \frac{\eps\alpha_{\text{max}}}{n}\sum_{u\in\WW^\pr} \left\lfloor \frac{n\alpha(u)}{\eps\alpha_{\text{max}}}\right\rfloor\\
    &\ge \frac{\eps\alpha_{\text{max}}}{n}\sum_{u\in\WW} \left\lfloor \frac{n\alpha(u)}{\eps\alpha_{\text{max}}}\right\rfloor&\text{[since $\WW^\pr$ is an optimal solution of $\II^\pr$]}\\
    &\ge \frac{\eps\alpha_{\text{max}}}{n}\sum_{u\in\WW} \left( \frac{n\alpha(u)}{\eps\alpha_{\text{max}}}-1\right)\\
    &\ge \left(\sum_{u\in\WW}\alpha(u)\right)-\eps\alpha_{\text{max}}\\
    &\ge \OPT(\II)-\eps\OPT(\II) & \text{[$\alpha_{\text{max}}\le\OPT(\II)$]}\\
    &=(1-\eps)\OPT(\II)
\end{align*}
Hence, the approximation factor of our algorithm is $(1-\eps)$. We now analyze the running time of our algorithm.

The value of any optimal solution of $\II^\pr$ is at most
\[\sum_{u\in\VV}\alpha^\pr(u) \le \frac{n}{\eps\alpha_{\text{max}}}\sum_{u\in\VV}\alpha(u)\le \frac{n}{\eps\alpha_{\text{max}}}\sum_{u\in\VV}\alpha_{\text{max}}=\frac{n^2}{\eps}. \]
Hence, the running time of our algorithm is $2^{\tw\log \tw}\cdot \text{poly}(n,1/\eps)$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Other Parameters}

We next consider $vcs$, the maximum size of a minimum vertex cover of the subgraph induced by any solution of \pa, as our parameter. That is, $vcs(\II=(\GG,(w(u))_{u\in\VV},(\alpha(u))_{u\in\VV},s,d) = \max\{\text{size of minimum vertex cover of }W: W\subseteq\VV\text{ is a solution of }\II\}.$ We already know from \Cref{thm:pa-star-npc} that \pa is \NPC for star graphs. We note that $vcs$ is one for star graphs. Hence, \pa is \PNPH with respect to $vcs$, that is, there is no algorithm for \pa which runs in polynomial time even for constant values of $vsc$. However, whether there exists any algorithm with running time $\OO(f(vcs).\text{poly}(n,s,d))$, remains a valid question. We answer this question negatively in \Cref{thm:vcs-woh}. For that, we exhibit an \FPT-reduction from \pvc which is known to be \WOH parameterized by the size of the partial vertex cover we are looking for.


\begin{definition}[\pvc]
Given a graph $\GG=(\VV,\EE)$ and two integers $k$ and $\el$, compute if there exists a subset $\VV^\pr\subseteq\VV$ such that (i) $|\VV^\pr|\le k$ and (ii) there exist at least $\el$ edges whose one or both end points belong to $\VV^\pr$. We denote an arbitrary instance of \pvc by $(\GG,k,\el)$.
\end{definition}

% We know that \pvc is \WOH parameterized by $k$. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:vcs-woh}
There is no algorithm for \pa running in time $\OO(f(vcs).\text{poly}(n,s,d))$ unless \ETH fails.
\end{theorem}




\begin{proof}
At a high-level, our reduction from \pvc is similar to the reduction in \Cref{thm:pa-gen-npc}. The only difference is that we will now have only one ``global vertex'' instead of the ``global path'' in the proof of \Cref{thm:pa-gen-npc}. Formally, our reduction is as follows.

Let $(\GG=(\VV,\EE),k,\el)$ be an arbitrary instance of \pvc. We consider the following instance $(\GG^\pr=(\VV^\pr,\EE^\pr),(w(u))_{u\in\VV^\pr},(\alpha(u))_{u\in\VV^\pr},s,d)$ of \pa.
\begin{align*}
    &\VV^\pr = \{u_i: i\in[n]\} \cup \{h_e: e\in \EE\}\cup\{g\}\\
    &\EE^\pr = \{\{u_i,h_e\}: i\in[n], e \in\EE, e\text{ is incident on }v_i\text{ in }\GG\}
    \cup \{\{u_i,g\}: i\in[n]\}\\
    &w(u_i) = 1, \alpha(u_i)=0, \forall i\in[n], 
    w(h_e)=0, \alpha(h_e)=1, \forall e\in\EE,\\
    &w(g)=0, \alpha(g)=0, s=k, d=\el
\end{align*}
We claim that the two instances are equivalent.

In one direction, let us suppose that the \pvc instance is a \yes instance. Let $\WW\subseteq\VV$ covers at least \el edges in \GG and $|\WW|\le k$. We consider $\UU=\{u_i: i\in[n],v_i\in\WW\}\cup\{h_e: e\in\EE, e\text{ is covered by }\WW\}\cup\{g\}\subseteq \VV^\pr$. We claim that $\GG^\pr[\UU]$ is connected. Since there is an edge between $u_i$ and $g$ for every $i\in[n]$, the induced subgraph $\GG^\pr[\{u_i: i\in[n],v_i\in\WW\}\cup\{g\}]$ is connected. Also, since $h_e$ belongs to \UU only if \WW covers $e$ in \GG, the induced subgraph $\GG^\pr[\UU]$ is connected. Now we have $w(\UU)=\sum_{i=1}^n w(u_i)\mathbbm{1}(u_i\in\UU) + w(g) + \sum_{e\in\EE, \WW\text{ covers }e} w(h_e)=|\WW|\le k$. We also have $\alpha(\UU)=\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha(u_i)\mathbbm{1}(u_i\in\UU) + \alpha(g) + \sum_{e\in\EE, \WW\text{ covers }e} \alpha(h_e)\ge\el$. Hence, the \pa instance is also a \yes instance.

In the other direction, let us assume that the \pa instance is a \yes instance. Let $\UU\subseteq\VV^\pr$ be a solution of the \pa instance. We consider $\WW=\{v_i: i\in[n]: u_i\in\UU\}$. Since $s=k$, we have $|\WW|\le k$. Also, since $d=\el$, we have $|\{h_e: e\in\EE\}\cap\UU|\ge\el$. We claim that \WW covers every edge in $\{e: e\in\EE, h_e\in\UU\}$. Suppose not, then there exists an edge $e\in\{e: e\in\EE, h_e\in\UU\}$ which is not covered by \WW. Then none of the neighbors of $h_e$ belongs to \UU contradicting our assumption that \UU is a solution and thus $\GG^\pr[\UU]$ should be connected. Hence, \WW covers at least \el edges in \GG and thus the \pvc instance is a \yes instance.

We also observe that the size of a minimum vertex cover of the subgraph induced by any solution of the reduced \pa instance is at most $k+1$ --- the set consisting of the vertices in any solution of the \pa instance in $\GG^\pr$ which has weight $1$ and $g$ forms a vertex cover of the subgraph induced by the solution of the \pa instance. Also, all the numbers in our reduced \pa instance are at most the number of edges of the graph, and \pvc is \WOH parameterized by $k$. Hence, \pa is \WOH parameterized by the maximum size of the minimum vertex cover of any solution even when all the numbers are encoded in unary. Therefore, there is no algorithm for \pa running in time $\OO(f(vcs).\text{poly}(n,s,d))$ unless \ETH fails.
\end{proof}
