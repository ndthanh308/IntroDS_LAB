\section{Conclusion}

We study the classical \kp problem with various graph theoretic constraints, namely connectedness, path and shortest path. We show that \pa and \pathknapsack are strongly \NPC whereas \shortestpathknapsack admits a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm. All the three problems admit FPTASes for bounded treewidth graphs; only \shortestpathknapsack admits an FPTAS for arbitrary graphs. It would be interesting to explore if meta-theorems can be proven in this general theme of knapsack on graphs. \longversion{For example, one could study the problem on graph classes with properties such as heredity, etc. }
