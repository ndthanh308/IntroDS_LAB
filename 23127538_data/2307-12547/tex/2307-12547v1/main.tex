\begin{abstract}
We study the \kp problem with graph theoretic constraints. That is, we assume that there exists a graph structure on the set of items of \kp and the solution also needs to satisfy certain graph theoretic properties on top of \kp constraints. In particular, we need to compute in \pa a connected subset of items which has maximum value subject to the size of knapsack constraint. We show that this problem is strongly \NPC even for graphs of maximum degree four and \NPC even for star graphs. On the other hand, we develop an algorithm running in time $\OO\left(2^{\tw\log\tw}\cdot\text{poly}(\min\{s^2,d^2\})\right)$  where $\tw,s,d$ are respectively treewidth of the graph, size, and target value of the knapsack. We further exhibit a $(1-\eps)$ factor approximation algorithm running in time $\OO\left(2^{\tw\log\tw}\cdot\text{poly}(n,1/\eps)\right)$ for every $\eps>0$. We show similar results for several other graph theoretic properties, namely path and shortest-path under the problem names \pathknapsack and \shortestpathknapsack. Our results seems to indicate that \pa is computationally hardest followed by \pathknapsack and \shortestpathknapsack.
