\section{Conclusion}

We have studied the classical \kp problem with graph various theoretic constraints, namely connectedness, path, shortest path, and independent set. We have shown that \pa and \pathknapsack are strongly \NPC whereas \shortestpathknapsack admits pseudo-polynomial time algorithm. All the four problems admit FPTAS for bounded treewidth graph; only \shortestpathknapsack admits an FPTAS for arbitrary graphs. It would be interesting to explore if meta-theorems can be proven in this general theme of knapsack on graphs. For example, one could study the problem on graph classes with properties such as heredity, etc.
