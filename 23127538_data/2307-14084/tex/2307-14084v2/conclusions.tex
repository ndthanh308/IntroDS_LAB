\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
The measurement of the non-prompt \Dzero-meson $v_2$ in midcentral Pb--Pb collisions (30--50\% centrality class) at \fNN is presented in the transverse momentum interval 2 $< p_{\rm T} < $12 GeV$/c$. The non-prompt \Dzero-meson $v_2$ is found to be positive with a significance of 2.7$\sigma$ and it is lower by 3.2$\sigma$ than the prompt non-strange D-meson $v_2$ (average of $\rm D^0$, $\rm D^+$, and $\rm D^{*+}$) in the range $2 < \pt < 8$ GeV$/c$. The measurement is important for the understanding of the degree of thermalisation of beauty quarks in the QGP.  Future data samples to be collected with the upgraded ALICE detector in Run 3 will allow for higher-precision measurements of the non-prompt \Dzero-meson $v_2$ and  $R_{\rm AA}$~\cite{Citron:2018lsq}. These measurements will provide important constraints to model predictions, and allow for accurate extraction of the spatial diffusion coefficient of beauty quarks.
