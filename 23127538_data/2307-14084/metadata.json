  "abstract": "The elliptic flow ($v_2$) of $\\rm D^0$ mesons from beauty-hadron decays (non-prompt $\\rm D^0$) was measured in midcentral (30-50%) Pb-Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The $\\rm D^0$ mesons were reconstructed at midrapidity ($|y|<0.8$) from their hadronic decay $\\mathrm{D^0 \\to K^-π^+}$, in the transverse momentum interval $2 < p_{\\rm T} < 12$ GeV/$c$. The result indicates a positive $v_2$ for non-prompt $\\rm D^0$ mesons with a significance of 2.7$σ$. The non-prompt $\\rm D^0$-meson $v_2$ is lower than that of prompt non-strange D mesons with 3.2$σ$ significance in $2 < p_{\\rm T} < 8$ GeV/$c$, and compatible with the $v_2$ of beauty-decay electrons. Theoretical calculations of beauty-quark transport in a hydrodynamically expanding medium describe the measurement within uncertainties.",
