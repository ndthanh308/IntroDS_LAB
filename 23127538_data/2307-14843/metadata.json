  "abstract": "We establish a coboundary condition for a sequence of ergodic sums (i.e.~Birkhoff partial sums) to be almost surely uniformly distributed mod $1$. Applications are given when the sequence is generated by a Gibbs-Markov map. In particular, we show that for almost every real number, the sequence of denominators of the convergents of its continued fraction expansion satisfies Benford's law.",
