  "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the rate at which the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of geodesic balls decreases as the radius approaches infinity. We prove that if the conformal infinity of an asymptotically hyperbolic Einstein manifold is of nonnegative Yamabe type, then the two-term asymptotic of the eigenvalues is the same as that in hyperbolic space.",
