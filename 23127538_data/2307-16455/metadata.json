  "abstract": "The stellar configurations of quark stars are studied using perturbative QCD (pQCD) for the equation of state (EoS). The neutron star structures with equation of state obtained from Brussels-Montreal extended Skyrme interaction are also explored. The deconfinement phase transition from quark to hadron phase in stellar interior for matter under extreme pressure is accomplished by employing the Maxwell construction. The influence of hybrid EoS on the jump in energy density has been investigated. To study hybrid stars the BSk24 hadronic model and pQCD EoS for the quark phase have been used. The properties of hybrid stars in the view of the very recent astrophysical observations have been examined. We find that the gravitational mass might exceed 2.3 $M_\\odot$ in some cases, comparable with the observed mass of the pulsar PSR J0952-0607 recently detected.",
