On its surface, this dissertation appears to be the culmination of 5 years of my work at USC, but it is impossible to overlook the huge community of people throughout my life who have helped me to get to this point. 
I hope to acknowledge a small number of them here.

Firstly, I'd like to thank Gaurav, my PhD advisor, for achieving the perfect balance of hands-on and hands-off mentoring which has allowed me to learn from his deep wisdom and yet grow on my own. His is a voice of calm reason, which was often exactly what I needed. I am grateful to have had a PhD experience where, though it certainly had its stressful aspects, my advisor was never one of them. Thank you for believing in me, and telling me so, when I felt I couldn't possibly do it. 

I'd also like to thank the other members of my PhD dissertation committee, David Caron and Stefanos Nikolaidis, who have been kind and supportive, and always had insightful questions for me.

I am fortunate to have received support from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program as well as the USC Annenberg and USC Kunzel Fellowships, which together have funded my research and granted me stability and flexibility during my PhD.

My experience would have been immeasurably less pleasant without Lizsl De Leon as my academic advisor and liaison to all things administrative at USC. Her care for me as a student was remarkable and her ability to resolve administrative tasks seemingly instantaneously was a gift to my sanity.

I am grateful for Maja Matarić's mentorship my first year at USC and for her unwavering support when I decided to make the huge move to several desks away. She was instrumental in my decision to come to USC, and for that I am thankful.

It is not an overstatement to say I would have not pursued graduate school at all without Julie Shah, my academic advisor and role model at MIT. She saw potential in me that I did not know was there, and without her gentle but insistent prodding, I would not have sought out research as an undergrad with her bright and talented student, Lindsay Sanneman. My positive experience with Lindsay in Julie's Interactive Robotics Group was key in leading me to where I am today. I'm so thankful to have learned from both of them.

In addition to Julie, there are so many faculty and staff I had the privilege of interacting with and learning from at MIT. To name a few: Marie Stuppard, Joyce Light, Prof. Balakrishnan, Prof. Radovitzky, Prof. Darmofal, Prof. Karaman, Prof. Williams,  Prof. How, Prof. Stirling, Prof. Miller, Prof. Spakovszky, and the entire AeroAstro department; Prof. Gibson, Prof. Gabrieli, Prof. Desimone, Prof. Fee, Prof. Hogan, Prof. Tenenbaum, and the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department; Prof. Minicozzi; Prof. Staffilani; and Prof. Kaelbling. My experiences at MIT were an indispensable foundation for everything following those four years.

I have also been fortunate to have been a part of several student groups throughout my many years as a student. 
MIT Women in Aerospace Engineering gave me a sense of community and friendship as well as an opportunity to develop leadership skills, including allowing me the joys of planning social events.
With such a positive experience with MIT WAE, it was no surprise that I found comfort in being a part of the committee for the USC PhD Women and Gender Minorities in Computing Club as well.

My education has been enhanced by the multiple internships I've been able to have. 
At NASA JPL, I'd like to thank Celina Clewans for her compassionate mentorship, intelligence, and patience, and Rich Rieber for his infectious enthusiasm and willingness to spend seemingly endless time teaching his curious intern. 
Anne Dorsey at Waymo has been a wonderful mentor, teacher, and friend over the past years, and I am lucky to have had such a positive experience even dealing with the realities of remote internships. With her and Jenny Iglesias, I always felt like a valued member of the team, and I'm thankful for their support and constant guidance both in technical and life questions.
I am also thankful to all the other coworkers and mentors that I've had the chance to interact with at both JPL and Waymo. You all made these experiences some of the highlights of the past five years.

If my future mentors are welcoming of even 1\% of the amount of questions that I asked Mr. Skerbitz in my high school Differential Equations \& Linear Algebra class, I will be unbelievably lucky. Thank you for not just tolerating but encouraging my truly incessant questions, even at 7:00am.
When asking for help feels daunting, I lean on the belief that it is not too much or too burdensome to ask, and my sense of curiosity is due in part to Mr. Skerbitz' extraordinary teaching.

I'm thankful for Mr. Kilkelly, another high school math teacher, whose joy in the \textit{aha} moments of understanding made me eager to keep learning and gave me determination to keep trying, even when I struggled. I'm also grateful for all my other teachers  and mentors at Wayzata and St. Louis Park -- Ms. Hagen, Mr. French, Mr. Bisanz, Ms. Speers, Mr. Gulsvig, Ms. Gohman, Ms. Brown, Mr. Cole, Mr. Ellingson, Mr. Heebink, Mr. Bailer, Mary Kay Williams, Mr. Vrudny, Mrs. Westman, Mrs. Anderson, Mrs. Blaeser, Sr. Franco, and Sr. Bleske are just a tiny few -- for giving me the foundations of my education and fostering a safe and nourishing environment for me to grow up in. 

My music teachers throughout the years were instrumental in encouraging creativity and inspiring me to see and hear beauty in every part of life. To Mr. Gitch and Ms. P-O, thank you. 

Pottery and ceramics have been a constant source of happiness and restoration for me. Thank you to Mr. Braun for introducing me to the art, and to Jay, Darrell, Julia, Tom, and Ki for their gentle direction and helpful instruction which have allowed me to experiment and continue building skills.

I've been shaped by my varied experiences abroad, which would not have been possible without the instruction and inspiration from all my many language teachers over the years, as well as my high school advisor Mr. Nagel's trust in me to complete a semester of courses abroad in Germany, and the support and many opportunities abroad that the MIT MISTI office offered me. To Mme. Magallanes, Mme. Janssen, M. Tuura, Mme. Levet, Mme. Showrai, Frau Gut, Frau Jaeger, Herr Suß, Frau Crocker, Nilma Dominique, Ikeda Sensei, and Matsumoto Sensei: Merci, danke, obrigada, arigatō gozaimasu for opening countless doors for me in every corner of the world and for sharing your love of languages with me. 

I am so fortunate to have many homes away from home. Thank you to Vivi and Astrid, Ann, Elli, and everyone else who has welcomed me when I have been in a new place. 

I am honored to have been a part of the Robotic Embedded Systems Lab at USC. My labmates in RESL have been supportive, engaging, and fun; they have challenged me and pushed me to be better and to learn new things; they have been excellent companions and collaborators. I am so grateful to have had the chance to work with such talented roboticists and good people. 
The work presented in this thesis would not have been possible without my collaborators. 
Peter Englert helped me navigate my first end-to-end research project and was a skillful mentor,
Ragesh Ramachandran provided indispensable technical knowledge, 
and Giovanni Sutanto brought new, interesting ideas and was excited to collaborate. 
My day-to-day research would have been undoubtedly less enjoyable without Chris Denniston to work with; our meetings were always rife with informative and interesting discussions, and I'm grateful that he convinced me early on that working on environmental robotics was very cool and fun.

To Micaela, my oldest friend -- our lasting friendship has been a great happiness to me, and knowing you are always there for me is a comfort I feel privileged to have.
Paige, your tremendous compassion and fantastic sense of humor have pulled me through some of my toughest challenges. You are a gift.  
To Kegan, thank you for your optimism and joy with the small things in life. I am lucky to call someone so kind and intelligent a close friend. 
To David, you made difficult parts of the PhD not just bearable but enjoyable, and I am grateful for your technical help and discussions, and your patience, support, and care over the years. 
Rachel, you are a star, and you inspire me every day. It's not often someone is talented in so many ways and still a sweet, caring, generous, and funny person besides the fact.
My dear friend Justin, you never fail to make me laugh, and I'm so thankful for our friendship. My life is better with you in it. Thank you for making me feel at home, wherever in the world we are.
Lilly, I couldn't have done half the things I've done without your constant, unconditional support, although you would say that of course I could have. Thank you for always understanding me even and especially when you're the only one in the world who does. 

Finally, nothing would have been possible without my family. My parents have shown me love, encouragement, courage, discipline, balance, joy, and strength. They've believed in me from the start, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have them and their support in my life. To my siblings, Wisi, Atzín, Agie, and Eli -- even when you're the worst, you're still the best. Thank you for bringing Gabbie, Angie, and CJ into my life, and Luca, Félix, and Mateo.

There are so many more people who have impacted me positively, both directly and indirectly, and I am so grateful to all of them. Thank you.
