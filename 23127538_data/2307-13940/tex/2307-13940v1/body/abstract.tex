The weighted Euler characteristic transform (\wect) is a new tool for extracting shape information from data equipped with a weight function.  
Image data may benefit from the \wect where the intensity of the pixels are used
to define the weight function.  In this work, an empirical assessment of the
\wect's ability to distinguish shapes on images with different pixel intensity
distributions is considered, along with visualization techniques to improve the
intuition and understanding of what is captured by the \wect.  Additionally, the
expected weighted Euler characteristic and the expected \wect are~derived.
