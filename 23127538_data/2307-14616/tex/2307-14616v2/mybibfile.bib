We obtain the n-dimensional heat conduction equation through the modification of the Hopf-Cole transformation. Then the fourth-order precise integration method (PIM) in combination with a spatially global sixth-order compact finite difference (CFD) scheme is presented to solve the equation with high accuracy. Moreover, coupling with the Strang splitting method, the scheme is extended to multi-dimensional (two, three-dimensional) Burgers’ system. Numerical results show that the proposed method appreciably improves the computational accuracy compared with the existing numerical method. Moreover, the two-dimensional and three-dimensional examples demonstrate excellent adaptability, and the numerical simulation results also have very high accuracy in medium Reynolds numbers.}

Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 061102 (2016).]. Abbott et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 241102 (2016).] presented parameter estimation of the source using a 13-dimensional, phenomenological precessing-spin model (precessing IMRPhenom) and an 11-dimensional nonprecessing effective-one body (EOB) model calibrated to numerical-relativity simulations, which forces spin alignment (nonprecessing EOBNR). Here, we present new results that include a 15-dimensional precessingspin waveform model (precessing EOBNR) developed within the EOB formalism. We find good agreement with the parameters estimated previously [Abbott et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 241102 (2016).], and we quote updated component masses of 35 +5-3 M{\textperiodcentered} and 30 +5-3 M{\textperiodcentered} (where errors correspond to 90% symmetric credible intervals). We also present slightly tighter constraints on the dimensionless spin magnitudes of the two black holes, with a primary spin estimate < 0.65 and a secondary spin estimate < 0.75 at 90% probability. Abbott et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 241102 (2016).] estimated the systematic parameter-extraction errors due to waveform-model uncertainty by combining the posterior probability densities of precessing IMRPhenom and nonprecessing EOBNR. Here, we find that the two precessing-spin models are in closer agreement, suggesting that these systematic errors are smaller than previously quoted.},

abstract = {The first observational run of the Advanced LIGO detectors, from September 12, 2015 to January 19, 2016, saw the first detections of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. In this paper, we present full results from a search for binary black hole merger signals with total masses up to 100M{\textperiodcentered} and detailed implications from our observations of these systems. Our search, based on general-relativistic models of gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole systems, unambiguously identified two signals, GW150914 and GW151226, with a significance of greater than 5s over the observing period. It also identified a third possible signal, LVT151012, with substantially lower significance and with an 87% probability of being of astrophysical origin. We provide detailed estimates of the parameters of the observed systems. Both GW150914 and GW151226 provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the two-body motion of a compact-object binary in the large velocity, highly nonlinear regime. We do not observe any deviations from general relativity, and we place improved empirical bounds on several highorder post-Newtonian coefficients. From our observations, we infer stellar-mass binary black hole merger rates lying in the range 9-240 Gpc-3 yr-1. These observations are beginning to inform astrophysical predictions of binary black hole formation rates and indicate that future observing runs of the Advanced detector network will yield many more gravitational-wave detections.},

abstract = {We present the results from three gravitational-wave searches for coalescing compact binaries with component masses above 1 Ma™ during the first and second observing runs of the advanced gravitational-wave detector network. During the first observing run (O1), from September 12, 2015 to January 19, 2016, gravitational waves from three binary black hole mergers were detected. The second observing run (O2), which ran from November 30, 2016 to August 25, 2017, saw the first detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral, in addition to the observation of gravitational waves from a total of seven binary black hole mergers, four of which we report here for the first time: GW170729, GW170809, GW170818, and GW170823. For all significant gravitational-wave events, we provide estimates of the source properties. The detected binary black holes have total masses between 18.6-0.7+3.2 M{\^{a}}™ and 84.4-11.1+15.8 M{\^{a}}™ and range in distance between 320-110+120 and 2840-1360+1400 Mpc. No neutron star-black hole mergers were detected. In addition to highly significant gravitational-wave events, we also provide a list of marginal event candidates with an estimated false-alarm rate less than 1 per 30 days. From these results over the first two observing runs, which include approximately one gravitational-wave detection per 15 days of data searched, we infer merger rates at the 90% confidence intervals of 110-3840 Gpc-3 y-1 for binary neutron stars and 9.7-101 Gpc-3 y-1 for binary black holes assuming fixed population distributions and determine a neutron star-black hole merger rate 90% upper limit of 610 Gpc-3 y-1.},

abstract = {We report on gravitational-wave discoveries from compact binary coalescences detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo in the first half of the third observing run (O3a) between 1 April 2019 15:00 UTC and 1 October 2019 15:00 UTC. By imposing a false-alarm-rate threshold of two per year in each of the four search pipelines that constitute our search, we present 39 candidate gravitational-wave events. At this threshold, we expect a contamination fraction of less than 10%. Of these, 26 candidate events were reported previously in near-real time through gamma-ray coordinates network notices and circulars; 13 are reported here for the first time. The catalog contains events whose sources are black hole binary mergers up to a redshift of approximately 0.8, as well as events whose components cannot be unambiguously identified as black holes or neutron stars. For the latter group, we are unable to determine the nature based on estimates of the component masses and spins from gravitational-wave data alone. The range of candidate event masses which are unambiguously identified as binary black holes (both objects ≥3 Mo˙) is increased compared to GWTC-1, with total masses from approximately 14 Mo˙ for GW190924_021846 to approximately 150 Mo˙ for GW190521. For the first time, this catalog includes binary systems with significantly asymmetric mass ratios, which had not been observed in data taken before April 2019. We also find that 11 of the 39 events detected since April 2019 have positive effective inspiral spins under our default prior (at 90% credibility), while none exhibit negative effective inspiral spin. Given the increased sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, the detection of 39 candidate events in approximately 26 weeks of data (approximately 1.5 per week) is consistent with GWTC-1.},

abstract = {We report on the population properties of compact binary mergers inferred from gravitational-wave observations of these systems during the first three LIGO-Virgo observing runs. The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3) contains signals consistent with three classes of binary mergers: binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star-black hole mergers. We infer the binary neutron star merger rate to be between 10 and 1700 Gpc-3 yr-1 and the neutron star-black hole merger rate to be between 7.8 and 140 Gpc-3 yr-1, assuming a constant rate density in the comoving frame and taking the union of 90% credible intervals for methods used in this work. We infer the binary black hole merger rate, allowing for evolution with redshift, to be between 17.9 and 44 Gpc-3 yr-1 at a fiducial redshift (z=0.2). The rate of binary black hole mergers is observed to increase with redshift at a rate proportional to (1+z)$\kappa$ with $\kappa$=2.9-1.8+1.7 for z≲1. Using both binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole binaries, we obtain a broad, relatively flat neutron star mass distribution extending from 1.2-0.2+0.1 to 2.0-0.3+0.3M⊙. We confidently determine that the merger rate as a function of mass sharply declines after the expected maximum neutron star mass, but cannot yet confirm or rule out the existence of a lower mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. We also find the binary black hole mass distribution has localized over- and underdensities relative to a power-law distribution, with peaks emerging at chirp masses of 8.3-0.5+0.3 and 27.9-1.8+1.9M⊙. While we continue to find that the mass distribution of a binary's more massive component strongly decreases as a function of primary mass, we observe no evidence of a strongly suppressed merger rate above approximately 60M⊙, which would indicate the presence of a upper mass gap. Observed black hole spins are small, with half of spin magnitudes below $\chi$i≈0.25. While the majority of spins are preferentially aligned with the orbital angular momentum, we infer evidence of antialigned spins among the binary population. We observe an increase in spin magnitude for systems with more unequal-mass ratio. We also observe evidence of misalignment of spins relative to the orbital angular momentum.},

abstract="The gravitational capture of a stellar-mass compact object (CO) by a supermassive black hole is a unique probe of gravity in the strong field regime. Because of the large mass ratio, we call these sources extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In a similar manner, COs can be captured by intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters or dwarf galaxies. The mass ratio in this case is lower, and hence we refer to the system as an intermediate-mass ratio inspiral (IMRI). Also, sub-stellar objects such as a brown dwarf, with masses much lighter than our Sun, can inspiral into supermassive black holes such as Sgr A* at our Galactic Centre. In this case, the mass ratio is extremely large, and hence, we call this system extremely large mass ratio inspirals (XMRIs). All of these sources of gravitational waves will provide us with a collection of snapshots of spacetime around a supermassive black hole that will allow us to do a direct mapping of warped spacetime around the supermassive black hole, a live cartography of gravity in this extreme gravity regime. E/I/XMRIs will be detected by the future space-borne observatories like LISA. There has not been any other probe conceived, planned, or even thought of ever that can do the science that we can do with these inspirals. We will discuss them from a viewpoint of relativistic astrophysics.",

Direct detection of GWs holds the promise of testing general relativity in the strong-field regime, of providing a new probe of exotic objects such as black holes and neutron stars and of uncovering unanticipated new astrophysics. LIGO, a joint Caltech–MIT project supported by the National Science Foundation, operates three multi-kilometer interferometers at two widely separated sites in the United States. These detectors are the result of decades of worldwide technology development, design, construction and commissioning. They are now operating at their design sensitivity, and are sensitive to gravitational wave strains smaller than one part in 1021. With this unprecedented sensitivity, the data are being analyzed to detect or place limits on GWs from a variety of potential astrophysical sources.}

abstract = {The grand challenges of contemporary fundamental physics—dark matter, dark energy, vacuum energy, inflation and early universe cosmology, singularities and the hierarchy problem—all involve gravity as a key component. And of all gravitational phenomena, black holes stand out in their elegant simplicity, while harbouring some of the most remarkable predictions of General Relativity: event horizons, singularities and ergoregions.

The hitherto invisible landscape of the gravitational Universe is being unveiled before our eyes: the historical direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration marks the dawn of a new era of scientific exploration. Gravitational-wave astronomy will allow us to test models of black hole formation, growth and evolution, as well as models of gravitational-wave generation and propagation. It will provide evidence for event horizons and ergoregions, test the theory of General Relativity itself, and may reveal the existence of new fundamental fields. The synthesis of these results has the potential to radically reshape our understanding of the cosmos and of the laws of Nature.

The purpose of this work is to present a concise, yet comprehensive overview of the state of the art in the relevant fields of research, summarize important open problems, and lay out a roadmap for future progress. This write-up is an initiative taken within the framework of the European Action on ‘Black holes, Gravitational waves and Fundamental Physics’.}

These sources have the potential to tell us much about astrophysics, but are also of unique importance for testing aspects of the general theory of relativity in the strong field regime. Here we discuss these sources from the perspectives of astrophysics, data analysis and applications to testing general relativity, providing both a description of the current state of knowledge and an outline of some of the outstanding questions that still need to be addressed. This review grew out of discussions at a workshop in September 2006 hosted by the Albert Einstein Institute in Golm, Germany.}

abstract = {We derive the analytical solutions of the bound timelike geodesic orbits in Kerr spacetime. The analytical solutions are expressed in terms of the
elliptic integrals using Mino time λ as the independent variable. Mino time decouples the radial and the polar motion of a particle and hence leads to forms
more useful to estimate three fundamental frequencies, radial, polar and azimuthal motion, for the bound timelike geodesics in Kerr spacetime. This paper
gives the first derivation of the analytical expressions of the fundamental frequencies. This paper also gives the first derivation of the analytical
expressions of all coordinates for the bound timelike geodesics using Mino time. These analytical expressions should be useful not only to investigate
physical properties of Kerr geodesics but more importantly to applications related to the estimation of gravitational waves from the extreme mass ratio
inspirals.}

abstract="Much of the success of gravitational-wave astronomy rests on perturbation theory. Historically, perturbative analysis of gravitational-wave sources
has largely focused on post-Newtonian theory. However, strong-field perturbation theory is essential in many cases such as the quasinormal ringdown following
the merger of a binary system, tidally perturbed compact objects, and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In this review, motivated primarily by small-mass-ratio
binaries but not limited to them, we provide an overview of essential methods in (i) black hole perturbation theory, (ii) orbital mechanics in Kerr spacetime,
and (iii) gravitational self-force theory. Our treatment of black hole perturbation theory covers most common methods, including the Teukolsky and
Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations, methods of metric reconstruction, and Lorenz-gauge formulations, presenting them in a new consistent and self-contained form.
Our treatment of orbital mechanics covers quasi-Keplerian and action-angle descriptions of bound geodesics and accelerated orbits, osculating geodesics,
near-identity averaging transformations, multiscale expansions, and orbital resonances. Our summary of self-force theory's foundations is brief, covering the
main ideas and results of matched asymptotic expansions, local expansion methods, puncture schemes, and point particle descriptions. We conclude by combining
the above methods in a multiscale expansion of the perturbative Einstein equations, leading to adiabatic and post-adiabatic evolution schemes. Our
presentation is intended primarily as a reference for practitioners but includes a variety of new results. In particular, we present the first complete
post-adiabatic waveform-generation framework for generic (nonresonant) orbits in Kerr.",

We first review the Teukolsky formalism for dealing with the gravitational perturbation of a black hole. Then we develop a systematic method to calculate higher order post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational waves emitted by an orbiting particle. As applications of this method, we consider orbits that are nearly circular, including exactly circular ones, slightly eccentric ones and slightly inclined orbits off the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole and give the energy flux and angular momentum flux formulas at infinity with higher order post-Newtonian corrections. Using a different method that makes use of an analytic series representation of the solution of the Teukolsky equation, we also give a post-Newtonian expanded formula for the energy flux absorbed by a Kerr black hole for a circular orbit.}",

This effective-one-body approach defines, in a non-perturbative manner, the late dynamical evolution of a coalescing binary system of compact objects. The transition from the adiabatic inspiral, driven by gravitational radiation damping, to an unstable plunge, induced by strong spacetime curvature, is predicted to occur for orbits more tightly bound than the innermost stable circular orbit in a Schwarzschild metric of mass M =m1+m2. The binding energy, angular momentum and orbital frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit for the time-symmetric two-body problem are determined as a function of the mass ratio. {\textcopyright}1999 The American Physical Society.},

In both spacetimes, the solutions for the angular and radial parts of the corresponding Klein–Gordon equations are obtained exactly, for massive and massless fields, respectively.

abstract = {The differential equation, x(x - X0) (d2y/dx 2) + (B1 + B2x) (dy/dx) + [$\omega$ 2x(x - x0) - [2$\eta$$\omega$(x - x0) + B 3]y = 0, arises both in the quantum scattering theory of nonrelativistic electrons from polar molecules and ions, and, in the guise of Teukolsky's equations, in the theory of radiation processes involving black holes. This article discusses analytic representations of solutions to this equation. Previous results of Hylleraas [E. Hylleraas, Z. Phys. 71, 739 (1931)], Jaff{\'{e}} [G. Jaff{\'{e}}, Z. Phys. 87, 535 (1934)], Baber and Hass{\'{e}} [W. G. Baber and H. R. Hass{\'{e}}, Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 25, 564 (1935)], and Chu and Stratton [L. J. Chu and J. A. Stratton, J. Math. Phys. (Cambridge, Mass.) 20, 3 (1941)] are reviewed, and a rigorous proof is given for the convergence of Stratton's spherical Bessel function expansion for the ordinary spheroidal wave functions. An integral is derived that relates the eigensolutions of Hylleraas to those of Jaff{\'{e}}. The integral relation is shown to give an integral equation for the scalar field quasinormal modes of black holes, and to lead to irregular second solutions to the equation. New representations of the general solutions are presented as series of Coulomb wave functions and confluent hypergeometric functions. The Coulomb wave-function expansion may be regarded as a generalization of Stratton's representation for ordinary spheroidal wave functions, and has been fully implemented and tested on a digital computer. Both solutions given by the new algorithms are analytic in the variable x and the parameters B1, B2, B3, $\omega$, x0, and $\eta$, and are uniformly convergent on any interval bounded away from x0. They are the first representations for generalized spheroidal wave functions that allow the direct evaluation of asymptotic magnitude and phase. {\textcopyright} 1986 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Expansions in series of Coulomb and hypergeometric functions for the solutions of the generalized spheroidal wave equations (GSWEs) are analysed and written together in pairs. Each pair consists of a solution in series of hypergeometric functions and another in series of Coulomb wavefunctions and has the same recurrence relations for the series coefficients, but the solutions inside it present different radii of convergence. Expansions without a phase parameter are derived by truncating the series with a phase parameter. For the Whittaker-Hill equation, solutions are found by treating that equation as a particular case of GSWE while, for the confluent GSWE, solutions, with and without a phase parameter, are given as pairs of series of Coulomb wavefunctions. Amongst the applications there are equations for the time dependence of Dirac test fields in some nonflat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes, the radial Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation for an electron in the field of two Coulombian centres and the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation for the Razavy-type quasi-exactly solvable potentials. For these problems it is possible to find wavefunctions in terms of infinite series, regular and convergent over the entire range of the independent variable, by matching expansions belonging to one or more of the above pairs. The infinite-series solutions for the Razavy-type potentials, in addition to the polynomial ones, suggest that the whole energy spectra may be determined without appealing to perturbation theory or semi-classical methods of approximation.},

%@article{Sasaki_2003,
%abstract = {We review the analytic methods used to perform the post-Newtonian expansion of gravitational waves induced by a particle orbiting a massive, compact body, based on black hole perturbation theory. There exist two different methods of performing the post-Newtonian expansion. Both are based on the Teukolsky equation. In one method, the Teukolsky equation is transformed into a Regge-Wheeler type equation that reduces to the standard Klein-Gordon equation in the flat-space limit, while in the other method (which was introduced by Mano, Suzuki, and Takasugi relatively recently), the Teukolsky equation is used directly in its original form. The former's advantage is that it is intuitively easy to understand how various curved space effects come into play. However, it becomes increasingly complicated when one goes to higher and higher post-Newtonian orders. In contrast, the latter's advantage is that a systematic calculation to higher post-Newtonian orders can be implemented relatively easily, but otherwise, it is so mathematical that it is hard to understand the interplay of higher order terms. In this paper, we review both methods so that their pros and cons may be seen clearly. We also review some results of calculations of gravitational radiation emitted by a particle orbiting a black hole.},

abstract = {The dynamical parameters conventionally used to specify the orbit of a test particle in Kerr spacetime are the energy E, the axial component of the angular momentum, Lz, and Carter's constant Q. These parameters are obtained by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi equation for the dynamical problem of geodesic motion. Employing the action-angle variable formalism, on the other hand, yields a different set of constants of motion, namely, the fundamental frequencies ωr, ωθ and ωϕ associated with the radial, polar and azimuthal components of orbital motion, respectively. These frequencies, naturally, determine the time scales of orbital motion and, furthermore, the instantaneous gravitational wave spectrum in the adiabatic approximation. In this paper, it is shown that the fundamental frequencies are geometric invariants and explicit formulae in terms of quadratures are derived. The numerical evaluation of these formulae in the case of a rapidly rotating black hole illustrates the behaviour of the fundamental frequencies as orbital parameters, such as the semi-latus rectum p, the eccentricity e or the inclination parameter θ− are varied. The limiting cases of circular, equatorial and Keplerian motion are investigated as well and it is shown that known results are recovered from the general formulae.}

In particular, the relations between the equations of Bardeen \&amp; Press, of Zerilli and of Regge \&amp; Wheeler are explicitly established. The equations governing the perturbations of the vacuum Schwarzschild metric - the Schwarzschild black hole-have been the subject of many investigations (Regge \&amp; Wheeler 1957; Vishveshwara 1970; Edelstein \&amp; Vishveshwara 1970; Zerilli 1970 a, b; Fackerell 1971; Bardeen \&amp; Press 1972; Friedman 1973). Nevertheless, there continues to be some elements of mystery shrouding the subject. Thus, Zerilli (1970a) showed that the equations governing the perturbation, properly analysed into spherical harmonics (belonging to the different l values) and with a time dependence iot, can be reduced to a one dimensional Schrodinger equation of the form }

The method is that employed by Jaffé in his determination of the electronic spectra of the hydrogen molecule ion in 1934, and analytic representations of the quasi-normal mode wavefunctions are presented here for the first time. Numerical solution of Jaffé’s characteristic equation indicates that for each l-pole there is an infinite number of damped Schwarzschild quasi-normal modes. The real parts of the corresponding frequencies are bounded, but the imaginary parts are not. Figures are presented that illustrate the trajectories the five least-damped of these frequencies trace in the complex frequency plane as the angular momentum of the black hole increases from zero to near the Kerr limit of maximum angular momentum per unit mass, a = M, where there is a coalescence of the more highly damped frequencies to the purely real value of the critical frequency for superradiant scattering. }

The main motivation is that Mathematica 12.1 has implemented a new family of special functions: Heun functions. Using the fact that Teukolsky’s equations for Kerr–de Sitter black holes are mapped to Heun’s equations, we are able to compute their QNM frequencies by the Heun function. In this approach, Mathematica normally evaluates these frequencies to arbitrary numerical precision in a few seconds. We further discuss an application to asymptotically flat rotating black holes.}

    abstract = "{We calculate the secular changes of the orbital parameters of a point particle orbiting a Kerr black hole, due to the gravitational radiation reaction. For this purpose, we use the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation in the first-order black hole perturbation theory, with the expansion with respect to the orbital eccentricity. In this work, the calculation is done up to the fourth post-Newtonian (4PN) order and to the sixth order of the eccentricity, including the effect of the absorption of gravitational waves by the black hole. We confirm that, in the Kerr case, the effect of the absorption appears at the 2.5PN order beyond the leading order in the secular change of the particle's energy and may induce a superradiance, as known previously for circular orbits. In addition, we find that the superradiance may be suppressed when the orbital plane inclines with respect to the equatorial plane of the central black hole. We also investigate the accuracy of the 4PN formulae by comparing to numerical results. If we require that the relative errors in the 4PN formulae are less than \\$10^\\{-5\\}\\$, the parameter region to satisfy the condition will be \\$p\\gtrsim 50\\$ for \\$e=0.1\\$, \\$p\\gtrsim 80\\$ for \\$e=0.4\\$, and \\$p\\gtrsim 120\\$ for \\$e = 0.7\\$ almost irrespective of the inclination angle or the spin of the black hole, where \\$p\\$ and \\$e\\$ are the semi-latus rectum and the eccentricity of the orbit. The region can further be extended using an exponential resummation method to \\$p\\gtrsim 40\\$ for \\$e=0.1\\$, \\$p\\gtrsim 60\\$ for \\$e=0.4\\$, and \\$p\\gtrsim 100\\$ for \\$e=0.7\\$. Although we still need the higher-order calculations of the PN approximation and the expansion with respect to the orbital eccentricity to apply for data analysis of gravitational waves, the results in this paper would be an important improvement from the previous work at the 2.5PN order, especially for large-\\$p\\$ regions.}",

Using this technique, the wave equations appropriate to perturbing, massless, D(0,s), fields in an arbitrary curved background are studied and a relationship between the decoupling of (at least) one of the equations and the algebraic degeneracy of the spacetime is shown. It is then found that sufficient conditions for decoupling the equations determining both of the radiative components (the extremal helicities) are that the space be of type D. Using Plebański–Demiański coordinates to describe such an arbitrary vacuum spacetime (of type D), we separate the (decoupled) perturbation equations for the radiative components corresponding to spin s=0, 1/2, 1, and 2.}",

abstract = {The interplay between black holes and fundamental fields has attracted much attention over the years from both physicists and mathematicians. In this paper we study analytically a physical system that is composed of massive scalar fields linearly coupled to a rapidly rotating Kerr black hole. Using simple arguments, we first show that the coupled black hole-scalar field system may possess stationary bound-state resonances (stationary scalar ‘clouds’) in the bounded regime , where μ and m are respectively the mass and azimuthal harmonic index of the field, and  is the angular velocity of the black-hole horizon. We then show explicitly that these two bounds on the dimensionless ratio  can be saturated in the asymptotic  limit. In particular, we derive a remarkably simple analytical formula for the resonance mass spectrum of the stationary bound-state scalar clouds in the regime  of large field masses: , where τ is the dimensionless temperature of the rapidly rotating (near extremal) black hole,  is a constant, and  is the resonance parameter. In addition, it is shown that, contrary to the flat-space intuition, the effective lengths of the scalar field configurations in the curved black-hole spacetime approach a finite asymptotic value in the large mass  limit. In particular, we prove that in the large mass limit, the characteristic length scale of the scalar clouds scales linearly with the black-hole temperature.}
