  "abstract": "We present a novel method that solves Teukolsky equations with the source to calculate radiation fluxes at infinity and event horizon for any perturbation fields of type-D black holes. For the first time, we use the confluent Heun function to obtain the exact solutions of ingoing and outgoing waves for the Teukolsky equation. This benefits from our derivation of the asymptotic analytic expression of the confluent Heun function at infinity. It is interesting to note that these exact solutions are not subject to any constraints, such as low-frequency and weak-field. To illustrate the correctness, we apply these exact solutions to calculate the gravitational, electromagnetic, and scalar radiations of the Schwarzschild black hole. Numerical results show that the proposed exact solution appreciably improves the computational accuracy and efficiency compared with the 23rd post-Newtonian order expansion and the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi method.",
