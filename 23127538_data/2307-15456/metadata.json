  "abstract": "We raise concerns about controllers' robustness in simple reinforcement learning benchmark problems. We focus on neural network controllers and their low neuron and symbolic abstractions. A typical controller reaching high mean return values still generates an abundance of persistent low-return solutions, which is a highly undesirable property, easily exploitable by an adversary. We find that the simpler controllers admit more persistent bad solutions. We provide an algorithm for a systematic robustness study and prove existence of persistent solutions and, in some cases, periodic orbits, using a computer-assisted proof methodology.",
