% author names and IEEE memberships
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks
% was not built to handle multiple paragraphs
%
%
%\IEEEcompsocitemizethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted
% lists the Computer Society journals use for "first footnote" author
% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript
% received ..."  text while in non-compsoc journals this is reversed. Sigh.

\author{
Jingjia~Shi*, Shuaifeng~Zhi*$^\dag$, Kai~Xu$^\dag$% <-this % stops a space
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks{
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem The first two authors contributed equally to this work.
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem  Shuaifeng Zhi and Kai Xu are corresponding authors..
% }% <-this % stops an unwanted space
\thanks{* The first two authors contributed equally to this work.}
\thanks{$^\dag$ Shuaifeng Zhi and Kai Xu are corresponding authors.}
\thanks{Jingjia Shi, Shuaifeng Zhi and Kai Xu are with National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China.}
}

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
%
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.



% The paper headers
% \markboth{Journal of \LaTeX\ Class Files,~Vol.~14, No.~8, August~2015}%
% {Qin \MakeLowercase{\textit{et al.}}: Learning Fast and Robust Point Cloud Registration with Geometric Transformer}
% \markboth{Submitted To IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence}%
% {Shi \MakeLowercase{\textit{et al.}}: PlaneRecTR++}
% The only time the second header will appear is for the odd numbered pages
% after the title page when using the twoside option.
%
% *** Note that you probably will NOT want to include the author's ***
% *** name in the headers of peer review papers.                   ***
% You can use \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview for conditional compilation here if
% you desire.



% The publisher's ID mark at the bottom of the page is less important with
% Computer Society journal papers as those publications place the marks
% outside of the main text columns and, therefore, unlike regular IEEE
% journals, the available text space is not reduced by their presence.
% If you want to put a publisher's ID mark on the page you can do it like
% this:
%\IEEEpubid{0000--0000/00\$00.00~\copyright~2015 IEEE}
% or like this to get the Computer Society new two part style.
%\IEEEpubid{\makebox[\columnwidth]{\hfill 0000--0000/00/\$00.00~\copyright~2015 IEEE}%
%\hspace{\columnsep}\makebox[\columnwidth]{Published by the IEEE Computer Society\hfill}}
% Remember, if you use this you must call \IEEEpubidadjcol in the second
% column for its text to clear the IEEEpubid mark (Computer Society jorunal
% papers don't need this extra clearance.)



% use for special paper notices
%\IEEEspecialpapernotice{(Invited Paper)}



% for Computer Society papers, we must declare the abstract and index terms
% PRIOR to the title within the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext IEEEtran
% command as these need to go into the title area created by \maketitle.
% As a general rule, do not put math, special symbols or citations
% in the abstract or keywords.
\IEEEtitleabstractindextext{%
\input{abstract}
}


% make the title area
\maketitle


% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the
% abstract/keywords data, the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext text will
% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
% here as \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext when the compsoc
% or transmag modes are not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected
% - because all conference papers position the abstract like regular
% papers do.
\IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext
% \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext has no effect when using
% compsoc or transmag under a non-conference mode.



% For peer review papers, you can put extra information on the cover
% page as needed:
% \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview
% \begin{center} \bfseries EDICS Category: 3-BBND \end{center}
% \fi
%
% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.
