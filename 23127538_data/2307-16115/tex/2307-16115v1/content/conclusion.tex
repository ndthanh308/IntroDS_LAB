In this paper, we propose an interpretable \& transferable what-if estimator for database knobs called IWEK, which could support efficient knob estimation for practitioners and researchers. Our method supports interpretable estimation by designing interpretable random forest model, efficiently achieve the knob ranking transfer by some statistic features of object database log and proposes effective estimator transfer by matching the data distributions. In addition, both our knob estimator and transfer model achieve high efficiency for model training due to their lightweight architecture. Our evaluation shows that with small training set, the transfer estimation of IWEK could achieve more than 75\% average evaluation accuracy. In the future, we attempt to improve our approach in many ways, such as utilizing smart interpretable models, designing comprehensive features of scenarios and simplifying the similarity computation algorithm for efficiently finding proper experiences.
