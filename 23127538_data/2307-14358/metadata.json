  "abstract": "We perform Monte Carlo simulation of the thermodynamic and structural properties of Hard-, Square-Well, and Square-Shoulder Disks in narrow channels. For the thermodynamics we study the internal energy per particle and the longitudinal and transverse compressibility factor. For the structure we study the Transverse Density and Density of Pairs Profiles, the Radial Distribution Function and Longitudinal Distribution Function, and the (static) Longitudinal Structure Factor. We compare our results with a recent exact semi-analytic solution found by Montero and Santos for the single file formation and first nearest neighbor fluid and explore how their solution performs when these conditions are not fulfilled making it just an approximation.",
