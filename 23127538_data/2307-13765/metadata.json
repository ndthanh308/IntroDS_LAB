  "abstract": "The integrity of offshore wind turbines, pivotal for sustainable energy generation, is often compromised by surface material defects. Despite the availability of various detection techniques, limitations persist regarding cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability. Addressing these shortcomings, this study introduces a novel approach leveraging an advanced version of the YOLOv8 object detection model, supplemented with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) for improved feature recognition. The optimized loss function further refines the learning process. Employing a dataset of 5,432 images from the Saemangeum offshore wind farm and a publicly available dataset, our method underwent rigorous testing. The findings reveal a substantial enhancement in defect detection stability, marking a significant stride towards efficient turbine maintenance. This study's contributions illuminate the path for future research, potentially revolutionizing sustainable energy practices.",
