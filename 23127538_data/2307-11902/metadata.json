  "abstract": "The Ocean Heat Uptake Efficiency (OHUE) quantifies the ocean's ability to mitigate surface warming through deep heat sequestration. Despite its importance, the main controls on OHUE, as well as its nearly two-fold spread across contemporary climate models, remain unclear. We argue that OHUE is primarily controlled by the strength of mid-latitude ventilation in the background climate, itself related to subtropical pycnocline depth and ocean stratification. This hypothesis is supported by a strong correlation between OHUE and pycnocline depth in the CMIP5 and CMIP6 under RCP85/SSP585, as well as in MITgcm. We explain these results through a regional OHUE decomposition, showing that the mid-latitudes largely account for both: (1) global heat uptake after increased radiative forcing and; (2) the correlation between pycnocline depth and OHUE. Coupled with the nearly equivalent inter-model spreads in OHUE/pycnocline depth, these results imply that mid-latitude ventilation also dominates the ensemble spread in OHUE. Our results provide a pathway towards observationally constraining OHUE, and thus future climate.",
