%  SUPPORTING INFORMATION TEMPLATE
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%
%
%
%Please use this template when formatting and submitting your Supporting Information.

%This template serves as both a “table of contents” for the supporting information for your article and as a summary of files.
%
%
%OVERVIEW
%
%Please note that all supporting information will be peer reviewed with your manuscript. It will not be copyedited if the paper is accepted.
%In general, the purpose of the supporting information is to enable authors to provide and archive auxiliary information such as data tables, method information, figures, video, or computer software, in digital formats so that other scientists can use it.
%The key criteria are that the data:
% 1. supplement the main scientific conclusions of the paper but are not essential to the conclusions (with the exception of
%    including %data so the experiment can be reproducible);
% 2. are likely to be usable or used by other scientists working in the field;
% 3. are described with sufficient precision that other scientists can understand them, and
% 4. are not exe files.
%
%USING THIS TEMPLATE
%
%***All references should be included in the reference list of the main paper so that they can be indexed, linked, and counted as citations.  The reference section does not count toward length limits.
%
%All Supporting text and figures should be included in this document. Insert supporting information content into each appropriate section of the template. To add additional captions, simply copy and paste each sample as needed.

%Tables may be included, but can also be uploaded separately, especially if they are larger than 1 page, or if necessary for retaining table formatting. Data sets, large tables, movie files, and audio files should be uploaded separately. Include their captions in this document and list the file name with the caption. You will be prompted to upload these files on the Upload Files tab during the submission process, using file type “Supporting Information (SI)”

%IMPORTANT NOTE ON FIGURES AND TABLES

\noindent\textbf{Text S1.}
As described in Section 2.3, our modified density variable, $\overline{\rho}_{norm}$, is calculated by from a modified density field $\overline{\rho^*}$, which excludes all densities less than all density classes in the subtropical surface gyres, water masses of density $\overline{\rho}_{gyre} \equiv \overline{\rho}(45S,350 m)$ or less. We then normalize  $\overline{\rho^*}$ so that it varies from $0$ to $1$ from the bottom, $z=B$, to the top-most grid  point, which is located at the surface of at the base of $\overline{\rho}_{gyre}$,  i.e.,

\begin{equation}
 \overline{\rho}_{norm}(y,z) = \frac{\overline{\rho^*}(y,B)-\overline{\rho^*}(y,z)}{\mbox{max}_{z}\big(\overline{\rho^*}(y,B)-\overline{\rho^*}(y,z)\big)},
 \label{pyc}
\end{equation}
or Eq. 4 in the main text.  To clarify the usefulness of excluding the surface gyres, we compare $\overline{\rho}_{norm}(y,z)$ calculated as in Eq. \ref{pyc} versus without omitting surface gyres:

\begin{equation}
 \overline{\rho}_{full}(y,z) = \frac{\overline{\rho}(y,B)-\overline{\rho}(y,z)}{\mbox{max}_{z}\big(\overline{\rho}(y,B)-\overline{\rho}(y,z)\big)},
 \label{pyc}
\end{equation}
in Fig. \ref{fs1}.  For reference, Fig. \ref{fs1}a shows $\overline{\rho}$, in the CMIP5-6 ensemble. Panels b-c compare $\overline{\rho}_{norm}$ to $\overline{\rho}_{full}$ , including the pycnocline depth defined as $d = \overline{\rho}_{norm}(1/e)$ and $d_{full} = \overline{\rho}_{full}(1/e)$, respectively. Fig. \ref{fs1}d  illustrates the vertical gradient of $\overline{N}(y,z)$, where $\overline{N} \propto \sqrt{\partial^2\rho/\partial z^2}$ and thus captures where the stratification in density changes rapidly. Note that here we use $\overline{N}$ instead of $\overline{N}^2$ to reduced the saturation of the figure. Overlaid on panel (d) are pycnocline metric $d$ and full depth metric, $d_{full}$. Panel (d)  illustrates that $d$ is generally co-located with an extreme in $\partial^2\overline{N} /\partial z^2$ $-$ a rapid decrease in stratification. Metric $d_{full}$, instead, shoals significantly at lower latitudes where watermasses $\approx>\rho_{gyre}$ are highly stratified and more closely corresponds to pycnocline with bounds the subtropical gyres, as opposed to the more deeply-penetrating watermasses of the mid-latitudes. 

\noindent\textbf{Text S2.}

To verify that our pycnocline metric (Section 2.3 in the main text) is a good representation of mid-latitude ventilation and stratification, we calculate two other scalar metrics: the zonal-average isopycnal slope and $\overline{N^2}$  in the Southern Ocean. Isopycnal slopes are defined as  

\[\overline{S}(y,z) = \frac{{\partial \overline{\rho}(y,z)}/{\partial z}}{ {\partial \overline{\rho}(y,z)}/{\partial y}}. \]
To obtain these scalar metrics, we average $\overline{N^2}$ and $\overline{S}$  between 450-900 meters and 57-47$^\circ$S, a region chosen to fall roughly above our pycnocline metric and below the winter mixed layer. We call these metrics the ``Southern Ocean stratification'' and ``Southern Ocean isopycnal slope,'' respectively.

As noted in the main text, these three metrics (including here the pycnocline depth) covary, since they measure related characteristics of the ocean state, interpreted as the strength of mid-latitude ventilation in the background state \cite{Gnanadesikan1999,Nikurashin2011b,Nikurashin2012b,TimeDependentResponseoftheOverturningCirculationandPycnoclineDepthtoSouthernOceanSurfaceWindStressChanges}. The correspondence between metrics bears out in CMIP5-6: Southern Ocean stratification is strongly correlated with $\overline{N^2}$ across similar depths north of 40$^\circ$S (R$\approx0.7-0.9$,  Fig. \ref{fs2}), as well as with global pycnocline depth (R$=0.9$). Similarly, Southern Ocean isopycnal slopes are also tightly coupled to  Southern Ocean $\overline{N^2}$ (R$=0.86$) and to pycnocline depth (R$=0.95$). This interconnection between Southern Ocean and global stratification affirms the dominance of the Southern Ocean in ventilating the global pycnocline, e.g.,  \citeA{Sallee2010SouthernVentilation,Khatiwala2012VentilationAge,Morrison2022VentilationPycnocline}.

Note that these Southern Ocean metrics ($\overline{N^2}$ and $\overline{S}$) also correlate strongly with OHUE and OHUE$_{MidLat}$ (Fig. \ref{fs5}). The co-variation of these metrics with pycnocline depth, and OHUE, support the interpretation of the pycnocline depth as a key measure of global stratification more broadly, and that stratification is strongly linked to OHUE.

% IF YOU HAVE MULTI-LINE EQUATIONS, PLEASE
% BREAK THE EQUATIONS INTO TWO OR MORE LINES

% To create multiline equations, use the

% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:

% Break each line at a sign of operation

% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.
