  "abstract": "Let $\\varepsilon>0$. We construct an explicit, full-measure set of $α\\in[0,1]$ such that if $γ\\in \\mathbb{R}$ then, for almost all $β\\in[0,1]$, if $δ\\in \\mathbb{R}$ then there are infinitely many integers $n\\geq 1$ for which \\[ n \\Vert nα- γ\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert nβ- δ\\Vert < \\frac{(\\log \\log n)^{3 + \\varepsilon}}{\\log n}. \\] This is a significant quantitative improvement over a result of the first author and Zafeiropoulos. We show, moreover, that the exceptional set of $β$ has Fourier dimension zero, alongside further applications to badly approximable numbers and to lacunary diophantine approximation. Our method relies on a dispersion estimate and the Three Distance Theorem.",
