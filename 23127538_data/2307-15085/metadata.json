  "abstract": "Frymire & Ardila (2023) reported an anomalous flux variation in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Sector 43 light curve of the white dwarf HZ 4. We show that this flux variation was caused by the main-belt asteroid 4382 Stravinsky traversing the nearby TESS pixels, and it is therefore not a cause for concern regarding the continued use of HZ 4 as a photometric standard star.",
