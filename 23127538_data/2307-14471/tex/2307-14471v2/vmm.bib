  abstract = {The \KeY\ system offers a platform of software analysis
		  tools for sequential Java. Foremost, this includes full
		  functional verification against contracts written in the
		  Java Modeling Language. But the approach is general enough
		  to provide a basis for other methods and purposes: (i)
		  complementary validation techniques to formal verification
		  such as testing and debugging, (ii) methods that reduce the
		  complexity of verification such as modularization and
		  abstract interpretation, (iii) analyses of non-functional
		  properties such as information flow security, and (iv)
		  sound program transformation and code generation. We show
		  that deductive technology that has been developed for full
		  functional verification can be used as a basis and
		  framework for other purposes than pure functional
		  verification. We use the current release of the \KeY\
		  system as an example to explain and prove this claim.}
