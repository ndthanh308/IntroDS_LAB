What are some of the most popular topics being discussed on \starlinksubreddit{} and what could we infer from them? For each month, we identify the list of popular posts and explore the topics of discussion. To do this, we rely on $2$ metrics -- the number of upvotes and the number of comments per post. Fig.~\ref{fig:post_popularity} plots the corresponding CDFs for the month of Feb'$22$. We observe that both the CDFs have long tails -- we pick popular posts which lie at the intersection of the $99^{th}$ percentiles of both the CDFs. For Feb'$22$, there are $1$,$898$ posts in total, and $8$ of them are identified to be popular based on the definition above. 

The most popular post is on the Ukraine war and the role of SpaceX Starlink in providing connectivity. We rather focus on the second most popular post which has $500+$ upvotes and $100+$ comments. We use NLTK to remove common stop words 
and create a word cloud of uni-grams for the post and the  comments on the post. Fig.~\ref{fig:roaming_wordcloud} shows that the most common uni-gram being discussed is `roaming'. As a next step, we generate a similar word cloud but this time with the bi-grams. The most common bi-gram is `roaming enabled'. We also analyze the sentiment scores of the specific post and the comments, and found them to be primarily \textsl{positive}, which increases our confidence on the fact that Starlink roaming might have been enabled in early February, $2022$.

Interestingly, while Redditors discussed Starlink roaming being functional on $23^{rd}$ Feb'$22$ already (we could also identify a smaller peak on the same topic on $15^{th}$ Feb), SpaceX officially notified~\cite{starlink_portability} Starlink subscribers on portability (roaming) mode only in May, $2022$ -- $3$ months down the line. Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, tweeted earlier~\cite{musk_roaming} on $3^{rd}$ March on mobile roaming being enabled, still $\sim${}$2$ weeks after we could detect the earliest signal from \starlinksubreddit{}. So, our framework could automatically detect that roaming have been enabled on the Starlink network way before any public announcements from SpaceX on the same.

Our methodology above could be used for different use cases. For example, ISPs could use such a tool to keep track of competition and be on the forefront of innovation. Also, while exploring the subreddit manually, we observed posts~\cite{reddit_link1,reddit_link2,reddit_link3,reddit_link4} which discuss deep technical aspects.
An extension to our methodology could allow ISPs to pinpoint such public discussions and learn from community expertise. As social networks get all the more ingrained in our lives, and with more people becoming comfortable discussing ideas and reporting facts online, ISPs could probably benefit from tapping into the public whiteboard discussions on social platforms. 

Also, at these early stages of LEO broadband, automatic identification of such events will allow potential customers, researchers, and Internet enthusiasts to keep track of all the features and their evolution over time. A potential customer in a remote area who `needs' the roaming capabilities might benefit from such early information on the same.
\aryan{We also observed Redditors discussing~\cite{orion1,orion2,orion3,orion4,orion5,orion6,orion7} performance bottlenecks (and opportunities) of applications, like video conferencing, over LEO broadband. These social media insights could allow application providers to pinpoint issues over these new networks and fix them early toward offering improved experience.}
