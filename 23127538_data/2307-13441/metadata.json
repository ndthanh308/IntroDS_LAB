  "abstract": "Multiple low-Earth orbit satellite constellations, aimed at beaming broadband connectivity from space, are currently under active deployment. While such space-based Internet is set to augment, globally, today's terrestrial connectivity, and has managed to generate significant hype, it has been largely difficult for the community to measure, quantify, or understand the nuances of these offerings in the absence of a global measurement infrastructure -- the research community has mostly resorted to simulators, emulators, and limited measurements till now. In this paper, we identify an opportunity to use the social media `lens' to complement such measurements and mine user-centric insights on the evolving ecosystem at scale.",
