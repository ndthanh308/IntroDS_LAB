  "abstract": "Static analysis tools are traditionally used to detect and flag programs that violate properties. We show that static analysis tools can also be used to perturb programs that satisfy a property to construct variants that violate the property. Using this insight we can construct paired data sets of unsafe-safe program pairs, and learn strategies to automatically repair property violations. We present a system called \\sysname, which automatically repairs information flow vulnerabilities using this approach. Since information flow properties are non-local (both to check and repair), \\sysname also introduces a novel domain specific language (DSL) and strategy learning algorithms for synthesizing non-local repairs. We use \\sysname to synthesize strategies for repairing two types of information flow vulnerabilities, unvalidated dynamic calls and cross-site scripting, and show that \\sysname successfully repairs several hundred vulnerabilities from open source {\\sc JavaScript} repositories, outperforming neural baselines built using {\\sc CodeT5} and {\\sc Codex}. Our datasets can be downloaded from \\url{http://aka.ms/StaticFixer}.",
