abstract = {We report the large effort which is producing comprehensive high-level young star cluster (YSC) catalogues for a significant fraction of galaxies observed with the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) Hubble treasury program. We present the methodology developed to extract cluster positions, verify their genuine nature, produce multiband photometry (from NUV to NIR), and derive their physical properties via spectral energy distribution fitting analyses. We use the nearby spiral galaxy NGC628 as a test case for demonstrating the impact that LEGUS will have on our understanding of the formation and evolution of YSCs and compact stellar associations within their host galaxy. Our analysis of the cluster luminosity function from the UV to the NIR finds a steepening at the bright end and at all wavelengths suggesting a dearth of luminous clusters. The cluster mass function of NGC628 is consistent with a power-law distribution of slopes {\$}\backslashsim -2{\$} and a truncation of a few times {\$}10{\^{}}5{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. After their formation YSCs and compact associations follow different evolutionary paths. YSCs survive for a longer timeframe, confirming their being potentially bound systems. Associations disappear on time scales comparable to hierarchically organized star-forming regions, suggesting that they are expanding systems. We find mass-independent cluster disruption in the inner region of NGC628, while in the outer part of the galaxy there is little or no disruption. We observe faster disruption rates for low mass ({\$}\backslashleq{\$} {\$}10{\^{}}4{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) clusters suggesting that a mass-dependent component is necessary to fully describe the YSC disruption process in NGC628.},

abstract = {The spectral energy distribution analysis of very young unresolved star clusters challenges our understanding of the cluster formation process. Studies of resolved massive clusters in the Milky Way and in the nearby Magellanic Clouds show us that the contribution from photoionized gas is very important during the first Myr of cluster evolution. We present our models which include both a self-consistent treatment of the photoionized gas and the stellar continuum and quantify the impact of such a nebular component on the total flux of young unresolved star clusters. A comparison with other available models is considered. The very young star clusters in the SBS 0335-052E dwarf starburst galaxy are used as a test for our models. Due to the low metallicity of the galactic medium our models predict a longer lasted nebular phase which contributes between 10{\%} and 40{\%} of the total near-infrared (NIR) fluxes at around 10 Myr. We thus propose a possible solution for the observed flux excess in the six bright super star clusters (SSCs) of SBS 0335-052E. Reines et al. showed that the observed cluster fluxes, in the red-optical and NIR range, sit irreconcilably above the stellar continuum models provided. We find that in the age range estimated from the H$\alpha$ emission we can explain the red excess in all six SSCs as due to nebular emission, which at cluster ages around 10 Myr still affects the NIR wavebands substantially. {\textcopyright} 2010.

As in earlier papers on M51 and NGC 4214, the uIMF in M83 is consistent with a universal IMF, and stochastic sampling of the stellar populations in the 103M clusters are responsible for any deviations in this universality. The ensemble cluster population, as well as individual clusters, also imply that the most massive star in a cluster does not depend on the cluster mass. In fact, we have found that these small clusters seem to have an over-abundance of ionizing photons when compared to an expected universal or truncated IMF.

abstract = {We present a study of the star cluster population in the starburst irregular galaxy NGC4449 based on B, V, I, and H$\alpha$ images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope. We derive cluster properties such as size, ellipticity, and total magnitude. Cluster ages and masses are derived fitting the observed spectral energy distributions with different population synthesis models. Our analysis is strongly affected by the age-metallicity degeneracy; however, if we assume a metallicity of ∼1/4 solar, as derived from spectroscopy of H II regions, we find that the clusters have ages distributed quite continuously over a Hubble time, and they have masses from ∼103 M ⊙ up to ∼2 × 10 6 M ⊙, assuming a Salpeter initial mass function down to 0.1 M ⊙. Young clusters are preferentially located in regions of young star formation (SF), while old clusters are distributed over the whole NGC4449 field of view, like the old stars (although we note that some old clusters follow linear structures, possibly a reflection of past satellite accretion). The high SF activity in NGC4449 is confirmed by its specific frequency of young massive clusters, higher than the average value found in nearby spirals and in the Large Magellanic Cloud (but lower than in other starburst dwarfs such as NGC1705 and NGC1569), and by the flat slope of the cluster luminosity function (dN(LV )L -1.5 $\alpha$V dL for clusters younger than 1Gyr). We use the upper envelope of the cluster log(mass) versus log(age) distribution to quantify cluster disruption, and do not find evidence for the high (90{\%}) long-term infant mortality found by some studies. For the red clusters, we find correlations between size, ellipticity, luminosity, and mass: brighter and more massive clusters tend to be more compact, and brighter clusters also tend to be more elliptical. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {Whether the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is universal or is instead sensitive to environmental conditions is of critical importance: The IMF influences most observable properties of stellar populations and thus galaxies, and detecting variations in the IMF could provide deep insights into the star formation process. This review critically examines reports of IMF variations, with a view toward whether other explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the vast majority were drawn from a universal system IMF: a power law of Salpeter index ($\Gamma$ = 1.35) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower power law ($\Gamma$ ̃ 0-0.25) for lower mass stars. The shape and universality of the substellar IMF is still under investigation. Observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of most galaxies are also consistent with a universal IMF, suggesting no gross variations over much of cosmic time. Indications of "nonstandard" IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments clearly warrant further study. However, there is no clear evidence that the IMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions after the first few generations of stars. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Annual Reviews.},

We follow the method of Calzetti et al.

abstract = {We use integral field spectroscopy from the PHANGS MUSE survey, which resolves the ionised interstellar medium structure at 50 pc resolution in 19 nearby spiral galaxies, to study the origin of the diffuse ionised gas (DIG). We examine the physical conditions of the diffuse gas by first removing morphologically defined H ¯II regions and then binning the low-surface-brightness areas to achieve significant detections of the key nebular lines in the DIG. A simple model for the leakage and propagation of ionising radiation from H ¯II regions is able to reproduce the observed distribution of H$\alpha$ in the DIG. This model infers a typical mean free path for the ionising radiation of 1.9 kpc for photons propagating within the disc plane. Leaking radiation from H ¯II regions also explains the observed decrease in line ratios of low-ionisation species ([S ¯II]/H$\alpha$, [N ¯II]/H$\alpha$, and [OI]/H$\alpha$) with increasing H$\alpha$ surface brightness ($\Sigma$H$\alpha$). Emission from hot low-mass evolved stars, however, is required to explain: (1) the enhanced low-ionisation line ratios observed in the central regions of some of the galaxies in our sample; (2) the observed trends of a flat or decreasing [O ¯III]/H$\beta$ with $\Sigma$H$\alpha$; and (3) the offset of some DIG regions from the typical locus of H ¯II regions in the Baldwin Phillips Terlevich (BPT) diagram, extending into the area of low-ionisation (nuclear) emission-line regions (LI[N]ERs). Hot low-mass evolved stars make a small contribution to the energy budget of the DIG (2{\%} of the galaxy-integrated H$\alpha$ emission), but their harder spectra make them fundamental contributors to [O ¯III] emission. The DIG might result from a superposition of two components, an energetically dominant contribution from young stars and a more diffuse background of harder ionising photons from old stars. This unified framework bridges observations of the Milky Way DIG with LI(N)ER-like emission observed in nearby galaxy bulges.},

abstract = {Context. The star cluster R136 inside the Large Magellanic Cloud hosts a rich population of massive stars, including the most massive stars known. The strong stellar winds of these very luminous stars impact their evolution and the surrounding environment. We currently lack detailed knowledge of the wind structure that is needed to quantify this impact. Aims. Our goal is to observationally constrain the stellar and wind properties of the massive stars in R136, in particular the wind-structure parameters related to wind clumping. Methods. We simultaneously analyse optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy of 53 O-type and three WNh-stars using the Fastwind model atmosphere code and a genetic algorithm. The models account for optically thick clumps and effects related to porosity and velocity-porosity, as well as a non-void interclump medium. Results. We obtain stellar parameters, surface abundances, mass-loss rates, terminal velocities, and clumping characteristics and compare them to theoretical predictions and evolutionary models. The clumping properties include the density of the interclump medium and the velocity-porosity of the wind. For the first time, these characteristics are systematically measured for a wide range of effective temperatures and luminosities. Conclusions. We confirm a cluster age of 1.0 2.5 Myr and derived an initial stellar mass of ¥250 Ma for the most massive star in our sample, R136a1. The winds of our sample stars are highly clumped, with an average clumping factor of fcl = 29 ± 15. We find tentative trends in the wind-structure parameters as a function of the mass-loss rate, suggesting that the winds of stars with higher mass-loss rates are less clumped. We compare several theoretical predictions to the observed mass-loss rates and terminal velocities and find that none satisfactorily reproduce both quantities. The prescription of Krticka {\&} Kub{\'{a}}t (2018) matches the observed mass-loss rates best.},

abstract = {Using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys/Wide Field Camera data we present the photometry and spatial distribution of resolved stellar populations in the outskirts of NGC 2915, a blue compact dwarf with an extended H I disc. These observations reveal an elliptical distribution of red giant branch stars, and a clumpy distribution of mainsequence stars that correlate with the H I gas distribution. We constrain the upper-end initial mass function (IMF) and determine the star formation law(SFL) in this field, using the observed main-sequence stars and an assumed constant star formation rate. Previously published H$\alpha$ observations of the field, which show one faint H II region, are used to provide further constraints on the IMF. We find that the main-sequence luminosity function analysis alone results in a best-fitting IMF with a power-law slope $\alpha$ = -2.85 and upper-mass limit Mu = 60M. However, if we assume that all H$\alpha$ emission is confined to H II regions then the upper-mass limit is restricted to Mu 20M. For the luminosity function fit to be correct, we have to discount the H$\alpha$ observations implying significant diffuse ionized gas or escaping ionizing photons. Combining the HST photometry with H I imaging, we find the SFL has a power-law index N = 1.53 ± 0.21. Applying these results to the entire outer H I disc indicates that it contributes 11-28 per cent of the total recent star formation in NGC 2915, depending on whether the IMF is constant within the disc or varies from the centre to the outer region.},

By comparing the observed main-sequence luminosity function to simulations, we determine the best-fitting IMF to have a power-law slope $\alpha$ = -2.35 ±0.3 and an upper mass limit Mu = 25-3+17 M⊙. This IMF is consistent with the observed H $\alpha$ emission, which we use to provide additional constraints on the IMF We explore the influence of deviations from the constant SFR assumption, finding that our IMF conclusions are robust against all but strong recent variations in SFR, but these are excluded by causality arguments. These results, along with our similar studies of other nearby galaxies, indicate that some XUV discs are deficient in high-mass stars compared to a Kroupa IMF. There are over one hundred galaxies within 5 Mpc, many already observed with HST, thus allowing a more comprehensive investigation of the IMF, and how it varies, using the techniques developed here.},

abstract = {Numerous theoretical models have long proposed that a strong He II $\lambda$1640 emission line is the most prominent and unique feature of massive Population III (Pop III) stars in high-redshift galaxies. The He II $\lambda$1640 line strength can constrain the mass and initial mass function (IMF) of Pop III stars. We use F132N narrowband filter on the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 to look for strong He II $\lambda$1640 emission in the galaxy BDF-521 at z = 7.01, one of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxies to date. Using deep F132N narrowband imaging, together with our broadband imaging with F125W and F160W filters, we do not detect He II emission from this galaxy, but place a 2$\sigma$ upper limit on the flux of 5.3 × 10 -19. This measurement corresponds to a 2$\sigma$ upper limit on the Pop III star formation rate (SFRPopIII) of ∼0.2 M⊙ yr-1, assuming a Salpeter IMF with 50 ≲ M/M⊙ ≲ 1000. From the high signal-to-noise broadband measurements in F125W and F160W, we fit the UV continuum for BDF-521. The spectral flux density is ∼ 3.6 × 10-11 × $\lambda$-2.32 erg s-1 cm-2 {\AA}-1, which corresponds to an overall unobscured SFR of ∼5 M⊙ yr-1. Our upper limit on SFRPopIII suggests that massive Pop III stars represent ≲4{\%} of the total star formation. Further, the HST high-resolution imaging suggests that BDF-521 is an extremely compact galaxy, with a half-light radius of 0.6 kpc.},

abstract = {The nearby dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 5253 hosts a number of young, massive star clusters, the two youngest of which are centrally concentrated and surrounded by thermal radio emission (the "radio nebula"). To investigate the role of these clusters in the starburst energetics, we combine new and archival Hubble Space Telescope images of NGC 5253 with wavelength coverage from 1500 to 1.9 $\mu$m in 13 filters. These include H$\alpha$, P$\beta$, and P$\alpha$, and the imaging from the Hubble Treasury Program LEGUS (Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey). The extraordinarily well-sampled spectral energy distributions enable modeling with unprecedented accuracy the ages, masses, and extinctions of the nine optically brightest clusters (MV {\textless} -8.8) and the two young radio nebula clusters. The clusters have ages ∼1-15 Myr and masses ∼1 × 104-2.5 × 105 Mo. The clusters' spatial location and ages indicate that star formation has become more concentrated toward the radio nebula over the last ∼15 Myr. The most massive cluster is in the radio nebula; with a mass ∼2.5 × 105 Mo and an age ∼1 Myr, it is 2-4 times less massive and younger than previously estimated. It is within a dust cloud with AV ∼ 50 mag, and shows a clear near-IR excess, likely from hot dust. The second radio nebula cluster is also ∼1 Myr old, confirming the extreme youth of the starburst region. These two clusters account for about half of the ionizing photon rate in the radio nebula, and will eventually supply about 2/3 of the mechanical energy in present-day shocks. Additional sources are required to supply the remaining ionizing radiation, and may include very massive stars.},

abstract = {The Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) is a Cycle 21 Treasury program on the Hubble Space Telescope aimed at the investigation of star formation and its relation with galactic environment in nearby galaxies, from the scales of individual stars to those of ∼kiloparsec-size clustered structures. Five-band imaging from the nearultraviolet to the I band with the Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3), plus parallel optical imaging with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), is being collected for selected pointings of 50 galaxies within the local 12 Mpc. The filters used for the observations with the WFC3 are F275W ($\lambda$2704 A˚), F336W($\lambda$3355 A˚), F438W($\lambda$4325 A˚), F555W($\lambda$5308 A˚), and F814W({\"{e}}8024 A˚); the parallel observations with the ACS use the filters F435W ($\lambda$4328 A˚), F606W($\lambda$5921 A˚), and F814W($\lambda$8057 A˚). The multiband images are yielding accurate recent (≲50 Myr) star formation histories from resolved massive stars and the extinction-corrected ages and masses of star clusters and associations. The extensive inventories of massive stars and clustered systems will be used to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of star formation within galaxies. This will, in turn, inform theories of galaxy evolution and improve the understanding of the physical underpinning of the gas-star formation relation and the nature of star formation at high redshift. This paper describes the survey, its goals and observational strategy, and the initial scientific results. Because LEGUS will provide a reference survey and a foundation for future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope and with ALMA, a large number of data products are planned for delivery to the community.},

Measures of opacity in local galaxies are reviewed together with widely used theoretical and empirical methods for quantifying its effects. Existing evidence shows that the dust content of nearby galaxies depends not only on their morphology, but also on their luminosity and activity level. A digression is devoted to starbursts in view of their potential relevance for measures of opacity in distant galaxies. Scarcity of coherent multiwavelength datasets hampers our ability to derive reliable obscuration estimates in intermediate and high redshift galaxies. This, in turn, limits the reliability of inferred physical quantities, such as star formation rates, stellar population ages, galaxy luminosity functions, and others.},

abstract = {Abstract What else can be said about star formation rate indicators that has not been said already many times over? The ‘coming of age” of large ground-based surveys and the unprecedented sensitivity, angular resolution and/or field-of-view of infrared and ultraviolet space missions have provided extensive, homogeneous data on both nearby and distant galaxies, which have been used to further our understanding of the strengths and pitfalls of many common star formation rate indicators. The synergy between these surveys has also enabled the calibration of indicators for use on scales that are comparable to those of star-forming regions, thus much smaller than an entire galaxy. These are being used to investigate star formation processes at the sub-galactic scale. I review progress in the field over the past decade or so. Introductory remarks My goal for this chapter, based on a series of lectures at the XXIII Canary Islands Winter School of Astrophysics, is to present current understanding and calibrations of star formation rate (SFR) indicators, both on global, galaxy-wide scales, and on local, sub-galactic scales. SFRs are, together with masses, the most important parameters that define galaxies and their evolution across cosmic times. Although SFR calibrations have existed, with various levels of accuracy, for many years and sometimes decades, the past eight to ten years have brought forth major progress, through cohesive, multi-wavelength surveys of nearby and distant galaxies.},

abstract = {(Abridged) We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 micron and 205 micron of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the ISO Photometer. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wavebands and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at lambda{\textgreater}40 micron. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T{\~{}}40-55 K (warm dust) and T{\~{}}20-23 K (cool dust), and with a dust emissivity index epsilon=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60{\%} of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to {\~{}}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 micron and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 micron is {\~{}}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. The FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-nearIR stellar emission is within a factor {\~{}}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20{\%} when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z{\textgreater}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in sub-mm surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.},

abstract = {Much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emitted by their stars, which depends on the present number of each type of star in the galaxy. The present number depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which describes the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed, and knowledge of it is critical to almost every aspect of galaxy evolution. More than 50 years after the first IMF determination, no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal among different types of galaxies. Previous studies indicated that the IMF and the dark matter fraction in galaxy centres cannot both be universal, but they could not convincingly discriminate between the two possibilities. Only recently were indications found that massive elliptical galaxies may not have the same IMF as the Milky Way. Here we report a study of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the large representative ATLAS 3D sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass, using detailed dynamical models. We find a strong systematic variation in IMF in early-type galaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratios, producing differences of a factor of up to three in galactic stellar mass. This implies that a galaxy's IMF depends intimately on the galaxy's formation history. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In terms of statistical fluctuations, stellar population synthesis models are only asymptotically correct in the limit of a large number of stars, where sampling errors become asymptotically small. When dealing with stellar clusters, starbursts, dwarf galaxies or stellar populations within pixels, sampling errors introduce a large dispersion in the predicted integrated properties of these populations. We present here an approximate but generic statistical formalism which allows a very good estimation of the uncertainties and confidence levels in any integrated property, bypassing extensive Monte Carlo simulations, and including the effects of partial correlations between different observables. Tests of the formalism are presented and compared with proper estimates. We derive the minimum mass of stellar populations which is required to reach a given confidence limit for a given integrated property. As an example of this general formalism, which can be included in any synthesis code, we apply it to the case of young (t ≤ 20 Myr) starburst populations. We show that, in general, the UV continuum is more reliable than other continuum bands for the comparison of models with observed data. We also show that clusters where more than 105 M? have been transformed into stars have a relative dispersion of about 10{\%} in Q(He+) for ages smaller than 3 Myr. During the WR phase the dispersion increases to about 25{\%} for such massive clusters. We further find that the most reliable observable for the determination of the WR population is the ratio of the luminosity of the WR bump over the H$\beta$ luminosity. A fraction of the observed scatter in the integrated properties of clusters and starbursts can be accounted for by sampling fluctuations},

As a general feature, the IMF is well described by a power-law form for {\$}m\backslashga 1 \backslashmsol{\$} and a lognormal form below. The extension of the disk IMF into the brown dwarf (BD) regime is in good agreement with observations and yields a disk BD number-density comparable to the stellar one {\$}\backslashsim 0.1 \backslashpc3{\$}. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk. The IMF characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\$}\backslashsim 1 \backslashmsol{\$}. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter IMF, respectively.

abstract = {We present a study of the recent star formation (SF) of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the panchromatic imaging survey Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project. In this paper we focus on the stars within 20 pc of the center of 30 Doradus, the starburst region NGC 2070. We recovered the SF history by comparing deep optical and near-infrared colormagnitude diagrams (CMDs) with state-of-the-art synthetic CMDs generated with the latest Padova and TRieste Stellar Evolution Code (PARSEC) models, which include all stellar phases from pre-main-sequence to post-main-sequence. For the first time in this region we are able to measure the SF using intermediate- and low-mass stars simultaneously. Our results suggest that NGC 2070 experienced prolonged activity. In particular, we find that the SF in the region (1) exceeded the average LMC rate ≈ 20 Myr ago, (2) accelerated dramatically ≈ 7 Myr ago, and (3) reached a peak value 1-3 Myr ago. We did not find significant deviations from a Kroupa initial mass function down to 0.5 MO. The average internal reddening E (B - V) is found to be between 0.3 and 0.4 mag.},

abstract = {Aims. The aim of this paper is twofold: (a) to determine the reliability of infrared (IR) emission to trace star formation in individual star-forming sites of M 33, and (b) to outline a new method for testing the distribution function of massive stars in newly formed clusters. Methods. We select 24 $\mu$m IR sources from the Spitzer survey of M 33 with H$\alpha$ counterparts and show that the IR luminosities have a weak dependence on galactocentric radius. The IR and H$\alpha$ luminosities are not correlated. Complementing the infrared photometry with GALEX-UV data, we estimate the bolometric luminosities to investigate how they are related to the H$\alpha$ luminosities. We simulate a theoretical diagram for the expected bolometric-to-H$\alpha$ luminosity ratio, Lbol/ LH$\alpha$, of young clusters as a function of the cluster luminosity. We then compare the observed Lbol/LH$\alpha$ ratios with the theoretical predictions. Results. In the log(LLbol/L H$\alpha$) plane, stellar clusters should be born along a curve that we call the cluster birthline. The birthline depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) at the high-mass end, but not on the cluster mass function. For an upper stellar mass limit of 120 M⊙, the birthline is flat for Lbol {\textgreater} 3 × 1039 erg s-1 because all clusters fully sample the IMF. It increases toward lower luminosities as the upper end of the IMF becomes incompletely sampled. Aging moves clusters above the birthline. The observations of M 33 show that young isolated clusters lie close to the theoretical birthline for a wide range of bol. The observed Lbol/LH$\alpha$ ratio increases toward low L bol like the theoretical curve, indicating that luminosity is not proportional to H$\alpha$ emission for low mass clusters. The best fit to the birthline is for a randomly sampled IMF, in which the mass of most massive star in a cluster is not strictly limited by the cluster's mass, but can have any value up to the maximum stellar mass with a probability determined by the IMF. We also find that the IR luminosity of young stellar clusters in M 33 is not proportional to their bolometric luminosity. This irregularity could be the result of low and patchy dust abundance. In M 33 dust absorbs and re-radiates in the IR only part of the UV light from young clusters. . {\textcopyright} 2009 ESO.},

For the first time, we spectroscopically classify all Weigelt and Baier members of R136a, which comprise three WN5 stars (a1-a3), two O supergiants (a5-a6) and three early O dwarfs (a4, a7, a8). A complete Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the most massive O stars in R136 is provided, from which we obtain a cluster age of 1.5+0.3-0.7 Myr. In addition, we discuss the integrated ultraviolet spectrum of R136, and highlight the central role played by the most luminous stars in producing the prominent He II $\lambda$1640 emission line. This emission is totally dominated by very massive stars with initial masses above {\~{}}100M⊙. The presence of strong He II ?1640 emission in the integrated light of very young star clusters (e.g. A1 in NGC 3125) favours an initial mass function extending well beyond a conventional upper limit of 100M⊙.We include montages of ultraviolet spectroscopy for LargeMagellanic Cloud O stars in the appendix.

We derive high stellar temperatures for the WN stars in NGC 3603 (T*{\~{}} 42 ± 2 kK) and R136 (T*{\~{}} 53 ± 3 kK) plus clumping-corrected mass-loss rates of 2-5 × 10-5 M. yr-1 which closely agree with theoretical predictions from Vink et al. These stars make a disproportionate contribution to the global ionizing and mechanical wind power budget of their host clusters. Indeed, R136a1 alone supplies {\~{}}7 per cent of the ionizing flux of the entire 30 Doradus region. Comparisons with stellar models calculated for the main-sequence evolution of 85-500 M. accounting for rotation suggest ages of {\~{}}1.5 Myr and initial masses in the range 105-170 M. for three systems in NGC 3603, plus 165-320 M. for four stars in R136. Our high stellar masses are supported by consistent spectroscopic and dynamical mass determinations for the components of NGC 3603A1. We consider the predicted X-ray luminosity of the R136 stars if they were close, colliding wind binaries. R136c is consistent with a colliding wind binary system. However, short period, colliding wind systems are excluded for R136a WN stars if mass ratios are of order unity. Widely separated systems would have been expected to harden owing to early dynamical encounters with other massive stars within such a high-density environment. From simulated star clusters, whose constituents are randomly sampled from the Kroupa initial mass function, both NGC 3603 and R136 are consistent with an tentative upper mass limit of {\~{}}300 M.. The Arches cluster is either too old to be used to diagnose the upper mass limit, exhibits a deficiency of very massive stars, or more likely stellar masses have been underestimated - initial masses for the most luminous stars in the Arches cluster approach 200 M. according to contemporary stellar and photometric results. The potential for stars greatly exceeding 150 M. within metal-poor galaxies suggests that such pair-instability supernovae could occur within the local universe, as has been claimed for SN 2007bi. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

To address this issue, we present SLUG, a new code to "Stochastically Light Up Galaxies." SLUG synthesizes stellar populations using a Monte Carlo technique that properly treats stochastic sampling including the effects of clustering, the stellar initial mass function, star formation history, stellar evolution, and cluster disruption. This code produces many useful outputs, including (1) catalogs of star clusters and their properties such as their stellar initial mass distributions and their photometric properties in a variety of filters, (2) two dimensional histograms of color-magnitude diagrams of every star in the simulation, and (3) the photometric properties of field stars and the integrated photometry of the entire simulated galaxy. After presenting the SLUG algorithm in detail, we validate the code through comparisons with STARBURST99 in the well-sampled regime, and with observed photometry of Milky Way clusters. Finally, we demonstrate SLUG's capabilities by presenting outputs in the stochastic regime.

abstract = {Objects with radii of 10-100 pc and masses in the range from 106 to 108 M⊙ have been discovered during the past decade. These so-called ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) constitute a transition between classical star clusters and elliptical galaxies in terms of radii, relaxation times and V-band mass-to-light ratios. Using new data, the increase of typical radii with mass for compact objects more massive than 106 M⊙ can be confirmed. There is a continuous transition to the typical, mass-independent radii of globular clusters (GCs). It can be concluded from the different relations between mass and radius of GCs and UCDs that at least their evolution must have proceeded differently, while the continuous transition could indicate a common formation scenario. The strong increase of the characteristic radii also implies a strong increase of the median two-body relaxation time, trel, which becomes longer than a Hubble time, $\tau$H, in the mass interval between 106 and 107 M⊙. This is also the mass interval where the highest stellar densities are reached. The mass-to-light ratios of UCDs are clearly higher than the ones of GCs, and the departure from mass-to-light ratios typical for GCs happens again at a mass of ≈106 M ⊙. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies turn out to be total outliers compared to all other dynamically hot stellar systems regarding their dynamical mass-to-light ratios. Stellar population models were consulted in order to compare the mass-to-light ratios of the UCDs with theoretical predictions for dynamically unevolved simple stellar populations (SSPs), which are probably a good approximation to the actual stellar populations in the UCDs. The SSP models also allow us to account for the effects of metallicity on the mass-to-light ratio. It is found that the UCDs, if taken as a sample, have a tendency to higher mass-to-light ratios than would be expected from the SSP models assuming that the initial stellar mass function in the UCDs is the same as in resolved stellar populations. This can be interpreted in several ways: as a failure of state-of-the-art stellar evolution and stellar population modelling, as a presence of dark matter in UCDs or as stellar populations which formed with initial stellar mass functions different from the canonical one for resolved populations. But it is noteworthy that evidence for dark matter emerges only in systems with trel ≳ $\tau$H. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

The average value of the power law index is very close to Salpeter ({\~{}}2.3), whereas the characteristic mass is in the range 0.1 - 0.5 Msolar and does not seem to vary in a systematic way with the present cluster parameters such as metal abundance and central concentration. However, a remarkable correlation with age is seen, in that the peak mass of young clusters increases with it. This trend does not extend to globular clusters, whose peak mass is firmly at {\~{}}0.35 Msolar. This correlation is due to the onset of mass segregation following early dynamical interactions in the loose cluster cores. Differences between globular and younger clusters may depend on the initial environment of star formation, which in turn affects their total mass.},

abstract = {Context. Energy and momentum injected by young, massive stars into the surrounding gas play an important role in regulating further star formation and in determining the galaxy's global properties. Before supernovae begin to explode, stellar feedback consists of two main processes: Radiation pressure and photoionisation. Aims. We study pre-supernova feedback and constrain the leakage of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation in a sample of ∼4700 H II regions in the nearby spiral galaxy M 83. We explore the impact that the galactic environment and intrinsic physical properties (metallicity, extinction, and stellar content) have on the early phases of H II region evolution. Methods. We combined VLT/MUSE observations of the ionised gas with young star cluster physical properties derived from HST multiwavelength data. We identified H II regions based on their H$\alpha$ emission, and cross-matched the sample with planetary nebulae and supernova remnants to assess contaminant sources and identify evolved H II regions. We also spectroscopically identified Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars populating the star-forming regions. We estimated the physical properties of the H II regions (luminosity, size, oxygen abundance, and electron density). For each H II region, we computed the pressure of ionised gas (Pion) and the direct radiation pressure (Pdir) acting in the region, and investigated how they vary with galactocentric distance, with the physical properties of the region, and with the pressure of the galactic environment (PDE). For a subset of ∼500 regions, we also investigated the link between the pressure terms and the properties of the cluster population (age, mass, and LyC flux). By comparing the LyC flux derived from H$\alpha$ emission with the one modelled from their clusters and WRs, we furthermore constrained any escape of LyC radiation (fesc). Results. We find that Pion dominates over Pdir by at least a factor of 10 on average over the disk. Both pressure terms are strongly enhanced and become almost comparable in the central starburst region. In the disk (R ≥ 0.15 Re), we observe that Pdir stays approximately constant with galactocentric distance. We note that Pdir is positively correlated with an increase in radiation field strength (linked to the negative metallicity gradient in the galaxy), while it decreases in low extinction regions, as is expected if the amount of dust to which the momentum can be imparted decreases. In addition, Pion decreases constantly for increasing galactocentric distances; this trend correlates with the decrease in extinction-indicative of more evolved and thus less compact regions-and with changes in the galactic environment (traced by a decrease in PDE). In general, we observe that H II regions near the centre are underpressured with respect to their surroundings, whereas regions in the rest of the disk are overpressured and hence expanding. We find that regions hosting younger clusters or those that have more mass in young star clusters have a higher internal pressure, indicating that clustered star formation likely plays a dominant role in setting the pressure. Finally, we estimate that only 13{\%} of H II regions hosting young clusters and WR stars have fesc ≥ 0, which suggests that star formation taking place outside young clusters makes a non-negligible contribution to ionising H II regions.},

abstract = {The stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) for the Galactic bulge, the Milky Way, other galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and the integrated stars in the universe are composites from countless individual IMFs in star clusters and associations where stars form. These galaxy-scale IMFs, reviewed in detail here, are not steeper than the cluster IMFs except in rare cases. This is true even though low-mass clusters generally outnumber high-mass clusters and the average maximum stellar mass in a cluster scales with the cluster mass. The implication is that the mass distribution function for clusters and associations is a power law with a slope of -2 or shallower. Steeper slopes, even by a few tenths, upset the observed equality between large- and small-scale IMFs. Such a cluster function is expected from the hierarchical nature of star formation, which also provides independent evidence for the IMF equality when it is applied on subcluster scales. We explain these results with analytical expressions and Monte Carlo simulations. Star clusters appear to be the relaxed inner parts of a widespread hierarchy of star formation and cloud structure. They are defined by their own dynamics rather than by preexisting cloud boundaries.},

abstract = {A new theory for the origin of bound galactic clusters is presented. This theory assumes that new stars appear at random times in a cloud core, and that the stellar masses are distributed according to some initial mass function. The primary result is an explanation for the differences between bound galactic clusters and expanding OB associations: bound clusters are the occasional result of star formation in low mass cloud cores (M {\textless} 10{\^{}}3-10{\^{}}4 M{\_}sun) and OB associations are the usual result of star formation in high mass cloud cores (M{\textgreater} 10{\^{}}4 M{\_}sum). Star formation should proceed in a cloud until the luminosity of the embedded cluster exceeds a critical value proportional to the total cloud mass. Then the cloud core disrupts. If the efficiency for star formation at this time of disruption is small, as will be the case for high mass cloud cores, then the cluster will be unbound after the gas leaves. If the efficiency is large, then a bound cluster can remain. The masses, stellar densities and radii of galactic clusters can be derived using only the observed initial mass function and mass—luminosity law for stars, and the characteristic gas densities of star-forming regions. We predict that high mass stars will form in the most massive clouds, that these stars will not generally appear until long after the first low mass stars form, and that some bound clusters will have a large spread in stellar ages.},

abstract = {Observed variations in the slope of the stellar initial mass function$\backslash$n(IMF) are shown to be consistent with a previously introduced model in$\backslash$nwhich the protostellar gas is randomly sampled from clouds with a$\backslash$nself-similar hierarchical structure. Root mean square variations in the$\backslash$nIMF slope around the Salpeter value are +/-0.4 when only 100 stars are$\backslash$nobserved, and +/-0.1 when 1000 stars are observed. Similar variations$\backslash$nshould be present in other stochastic models as well. The hierarchical$\backslash$nsampling model reproduces the tendency for massive stars to form closer$\backslash$nto the center of a cloud at a time somewhat later than the formation$\backslash$ntime of the lower mass stars. The systematic variation in birth position$\backslash$nresults from the tendency for the trunk and larger branches of the$\backslash$nhierarchical tree of cloud structure to lie closer to the cloud center,$\backslash$nwhile the variations in birth order result from the relative infrequency$\backslash$nof stars with larger masses. The hierarchical cloud sampling model has$\backslash$nnow reproduced most of the reliably observed features of the cluster$\backslash$nIMF. The power-law part of the IMF comes from cloud hierarchical$\backslash$nstructure that is sampled during various star formation processes with a$\backslash$nrelative rate proportional to the square root of the local density.$\backslash$nThese processes include turbulence compression, magnetic diffusion,$\backslash$ngravitational collapse, and clump or wavepacket coalescence, all of$\backslash$nwhich have about this rate dependence. The low-mass flattening comes$\backslash$nfrom the inability of gas to form stars below the thermal Jeans mass at$\backslash$ntypical temperatures and pressures. The thermal Jeans mass is the only$\backslash$nrelevant scale in the problem. Considerations of heating and cooling$\backslash$nprocesses indicate why the thermal Jeans mass should be nearly constant$\backslash$nin normal environments and why this mass might increase in starburst$\backslash$nregions. In particular, the relative abundance of high-mass stars should$\backslash$nincrease where the average density of the interstellar medium is very$\backslash$nlarge; accompanying this increase should be an increase in the average$\backslash$ntotal efficiency of star formation. Alternative models in which the rate$\backslash$nof star formation is independent of density and the local efficiency$\backslash$ndecreases systematically with increasing stellar mass can also reproduce$\backslash$nthe IMF, but this is an adjustable result and not a fundamental property$\backslash$nof hierarchical cloud structure, as is the preferred model. The steep$\backslash$nIMF in the extreme field is not explained by the model, but other$\backslash$norigins are suggested, including one in which massive stars in$\backslash$nlow-pressure environments halt star formation in their clouds. In this$\backslash$ncase, the slope of the extreme field IMF is independent of the slope of$\backslash$neach component cluster IMF and is given by (gamma-1)/alpha for a cloud$\backslash$nmass function slope, -gamma{\~{}}-2, and a power-law relation, M{\_}L{\~{}}M{\^{}}alpha{\_}c,$\backslash$nbetween the largest star in a low-pressure cloud, M{\_}L, and the cloud$\backslash$nmass, M{\_}c. A value of alpha{\~{}}1/4 is required to explain the extreme field$\backslash$nIMF as a superposition of individual cluster IMFs; cloud destruction by$\backslash$nionizing has this property. We note that the similarity between cluster$\backslash$nIMFs and the average IMF from global studies of galaxies implies that$\backslash$nmost stars form in clusters and that massive stars do not generally halt$\backslash$nstar formation in the same cloud.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Peaks and lulls in the star formation rate (SFR) over the history of the Galaxy produce plateaus and declines in the present-day mass function (PDMF) where the main-sequence lifetime overlaps the age and duration of the SFR variation. These PDMF features can be misinterpreted as the form of the intrinsic stellar initial mass function (IMF) if the star formation rate is assumed to be constant or slowly varying with time. This effect applies to all regions that have formed stars for longer than the age of the most massive stars, including OB associations, star complexes, and especially galactic field stars. Related problems may apply to embedded clusters. Evidence is summarized for temporal SFR variations from parsec scales to entire galaxies, all of which should contribute to inferred IMF distortions. We give examples of various star formation histories to demonstrate the types of false IMF structures that might be seen. These include short-duration bursts, stochastic histories with lognormal amplitude distributions, and oscillating histories with various periods and phases. The inferred IMF should appear steeper than the intrinsic IMF over mass ranges where the stellar lifetimes correspond to times of decreasing SFRs; shallow portions of the inferred IMF correspond to times of increasing SFRs. If field regions are populated by dispersed clusters and defined by their low current SFRs, then they should have steeper inferred IMFs than the clusters. The SFRs required to give the steep field IMFs in the LMC and SMC are determined. Structure observed in several determinations of the Milky Way field star IMF can be accounted for by a stochastic and bursty star formation history.},

abstract = {The total extragalactic background radiation can be an important test of the global star formation history (SFH). Using direct observational estimates of the SFH, along with standard assumptions about the initial mass function (IMF), we calculate the total extragalactic background radiation and the observed stellar density today. We show that plausible SFHs allow a significant range in each quantity, but that their ratio is very tightly constrained. Current estimates of the stellar mass and extragalactic background are difficult to reconcile, as long as the IMF is fixed to the Salpeter slope above 1 M⊙. The joint confidence interval of these two quantities only agrees with that determined from the allowed range of SFH fits at the 3$\sigma$ level, and for our best-fitting values the discrepancy is about a factor of 2. Alternative energy sources that contribute to the background, such as active galactic nuclei (AGN), Population III stars or decaying particles, appear unlikely to resolve the discrepancy. However, changes to the IMF allow plausible solutions to the background problem. The simplest is an average IMF with an increased contribution from stars around 1.5-4 M⊙. A 'paunchy' IMF of this sort could emerge as a global average if low-mass star formation is suppressed in galaxies experiencing rapid starbursts. Such an IMF is consistent with observations of star-forming regions, and would help to reconcile the fossil record of star formation with the directly observed SFH. {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of how best to correct astronomical data for the wavelength-dependent effects of Galactic interstellar extinction. The main general features of extinction from the IR through the UV are reviewed, along with the nature of observed spatial variations. The enormous range of extinction properties found in the Galaxy, particularly in the UV spectral region, is illustrated. Fortunately, there are some tight constraints on the wavelength dependence of extinction and some general correlations between extinction curve shape and interstellar environment. These relationships provide some guidance for correcting data for the effects of extinction. Several strategies for dereddening are discussed along with estimates of the uncertainties inherent in each method. In the Appendix, a new derivation of the wavelength dependence of an average Galactic extinction curve from the IR through the UV is presented, along with a new estimate of how this extinction law varies with the parameter R = A(V)/E(B-V). These curves represent the true monochromatic wavelength dependence of extinction and, as such, are suitable for dereddening IR--UV spectrophotometric data of any resolution, and can be used to derive extinction relations for any photometry system.},

abstract = {Recent observations indicate a lower H$\alpha$ to FUV ratio in dwarf galaxies than in brighter systems, a trend that could be explained by a truncated and/or steeper initial mass function (IMF) in small galaxies. However, at low star formation rates (SFRs), the H$\alpha$ to FUV ratio can vary due to stochastic sampling even for a universal IMF, a hypothesis that has, prior to this work, received limited investigation. Using SLUG, a fully stochastic code for synthetic photometry in star clusters and galaxies, we compare the H$\alpha$ and FUV luminosity in a sample of 450 nearby galaxies with models drawn from a universal Kroupa IMF and a modified IMF, the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF). Once random sampling and time evolution are included, a Kroupa IMF convolved with the cluster mass function (CMF) reproduces the observed H$\alpha$ distribution at all FUV luminosities, while a truncated IMF as implemented in current IGIMF models underpredicts the H$\alpha$ luminosity by more than an order of magnitude at the lowest SFRs. We conclude that the observed luminosity is the result of the joint probability distribution function of the SFR, CMF, and a universal IMF, consistent with parts of the IGIMF theory, but that a truncation in the IMF in clusters is inconsistent with the observations. Future work will examine stochastic star formation and its time dependence in detail to study whether random sampling can explain other observations that suggest a varying IMF. {\textcopyright} 2011.

abstract = {We present constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in two ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, Hercules and Leo IV, based on deep Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging. The Hercules and Leo IV galaxies are extremely low luminosity (MV = -6.2, -5.5), metal-poor (〈[Fe/H]〉 = -2.4, -2.5) systems that have old stellar populations ({\textgreater}11 Gyr). Because they have long relaxation times, we can directly measure the low-mass stellar IMF by counting stars below the main-sequence turnoff without correcting for dynamical evolution. Over the stellar mass range probed by our data, 0.52-0.77 M⊙, the IMF is best fit by a power-law slope of for Hercules and $\alpha$ = 1.3 ± 0.8 for Leo IV. For Hercules, the IMF slope is more shallow than a Salpeter ($\alpha$ = 2.35) IMF at the 5.8$\sigma$ level, and a Kroupa ($\alpha$ = 2.3 above 0.5 M⊙) IMF slope at 5.4$\sigma$ level. We simultaneously fit for the binary fraction, f binary, finding for Hercules, and for Leo IV. The UFD binary fractions are consistent with that inferred for Milky Way stars in the same mass range, despite very different metallicities. In contrast, the IMF slopes in the UFDs are shallower than other galactic environments. In the mass range 0.5-0.8 M⊙, we see a trend across the handful of galaxies with directly measured IMFs such that the power-law slopes become shallower (more bottom-light) with decreasing galactic velocity dispersion and metallicity. This trend is qualitatively consistent with results in elliptical galaxies inferred via indirect methods and is direct evidence for IMF variations with galactic environment. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {We present a study correlating the spatial locations of young star clusters with those of molecular clouds in NGC 5194, in order to investigate the time-scale over which clusters separate from their birth clouds. The star cluster catalogues are from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) and the molecular clouds from the Plateau de Bure Interefrometer Arcsecond Whirpool Survey (PAWS). We find that younger star clusters are spatially closer to molecular clouds than older star clusters. The median age for clusters associated with clouds is 4 Myr, whereas it is 50 Myr for clusters that are sufficiently separated from a molecular cloud to be considered unassociated. After {\~{}}6 Myr, the majority of the star clusters lose association with their molecular gas. Younger star clusters are also preferentially located in stellar spiral arms where they are hierarchically distributed in kpc-size regions for 50-100 Myr before dispersing. The youngest star clusters are more strongly clustered, yielding a two-point correlation function with $\alpha$ = -0.28 ± 0.04, than the giant molecular cloud (GMCs) ($\alpha$ = -0.09 ± 0.03) within the same PAWS field. However, the clustering strength of the most massive GMCs, supposedly the progenitors of the young clusters for a star formation efficiency of a few per cent, is comparable ($\alpha$ = -0.35 ± 0.05) to that of the clusters. We find a galactocentric dependence for the coherence of star formation, in which clusters located in the inner region of the galaxy reside in smaller star-forming complexes and display more homogeneous distributions than clusters further from the centre. This result suggests a correlation between the survival of a cluster complex and its environment.},

We investigate the clustering of these young stellar clusters and quantify the strength and change of clustering strength with scale using the two-point correlation function. We also investigate how image boundary conditions and dust lanes affect the observed clustering. The distribution of the clusters is well fit by a broken power law with negative exponent $\alpha$. We recover a weighted mean index of $\alpha$ ∼ -0.8 for all spatial scales below the break at 3.″3 (158 pc at a distance of 9.9 Mpc) and an index of $\alpha$ ∼ -0.18 above 158 pc for the accumulation of all cluster types. The strength of the clustering increases with decreasing age and clusters older than 40 Myr lose their clustered structure very rapidly and tend to be randomly distributed in this galaxy, whereas the mass of the star cluster has little effect on the clustering strength.

We have identified 3685 likely clusters and associations, each visually classified by their morphology, and we use the angular two-point correlation function to study the clustering of these stellar systems. We find that the spatial distribution of the young clusters and associations are clustered with respect to each other, forming large, unbound hierarchical star-forming complexes that are in general very young. The strength of the clustering decreases with increasing age of the star clusters and stellar associations, becoming more homogeneously distributed after {\~{}}40--60 Myr and on scales larger than a few hundred parsecs. In all galaxies, the associations exhibit a global behavior that is distinct and more strongly correlated from compact clusters. Thus, populations of clusters are more evolved than associations in terms of their spatial distribution, traveling significantly from their birth site within a few tens of Myr whereas associations show evidence of disruption occurring very quickly after their formation. The clustering of the stellar systems resembles that of a turbulent interstellar medium that drives the star formation process, correlating the components in unbound star-forming complexes in a hierarchical manner, dispersing shortly after formation, suggestive of a single, continuous mode of star formation across all galaxies.},

We find a strong spatial correlation between young star clusters and GMCs such that all clusters still associated with a GMC are younger than 11 Myr and display a median age of 2 Myr. The age distribution increases gradually as the cluster-GMC distance increases, with star clusters that are spatially unassociated with molecular gas exhibiting a median age of 7Myr. Thus, star clusters are able to emerge from their natal clouds long before the time-scale required for clouds to disperse. To investigate if the hierarchy observed in the stellar components is inherited from the GMCs, we quantify the amount of clustering in the spatial distributions of the components and find that the star clusters have a fractal dimension slope of -0.35 ± 0.03, significantly more clustered than the molecular cloud hierarchy with slope of -0.18 ± 0.04 over the range 40-800 pc. We find, however, that the spatial clustering becomes comparable in strength for GMCs and star clusters with slopes of -0.44 ± 0.03 and -0.45 ± 0.06, respectively, when we compare massive ({\textgreater} 105 M⊙) GMCs to massive and young star clusters.

abstract = {We present an analysis of the positions and ages of young star clusters in eight local galaxies to investigate the connection between the age difference and separation of cluster pairs. We find that star clusters do not form uniformly but instead are distributed such that the age difference increases with the cluster pair separation to the 0.25-0.6 power, and that the maximum size over which star formation is physically correlated ranges from {\~{}}200 pc to {\~{}}1 kpc. The observed trends between age difference and separation suggest that cluster formation is hierarchical both in space and time: clusters that are close to each other are more similar in age than clusters born further apart. The temporal correlations between stellar aggregates have slopes that are consistent with turbulence acting as the primary driver of star formation. The velocity associated with the maximum size is proportional to the galaxy's shear, suggesting that the galactic environment influences the maximum size of the star-forming structures.},

abstract = {We present a new study of H$\alpha$/FUV flux ratios of star-forming regions within a sample of nearby spiral galaxies. We search for evidence of the existence of a cluster-mass-dependent truncation in the underlying stellar initial mass function (IMF).We use an automated approach to identification of extended objects based on the SEXTRACTOR algorithm to catalogue resolved H2 regions within a set of nearby spiral galaxies. Corrections due to dust attenuation effects are applied to avoid artificially boosted H$\alpha$/FUV values. We use the BPASS stellar population synthesis code to create a benchmark population of star-forming regions to act as a reference for our observations. Based on those models, we identify a zone of parameter space populated by regions that cannot be obtained with a cluster-mass-dependent truncation in the stellar IMF imposed. We find that the investigated galaxies display small subpopulations of star-forming regions falling within our zone of interest, which appears to be inconsistent with imposing an IMF truncation at maximum stellar mass dependent on the total cluster mass. The presence of those regions is expected in models using both stochastic and sorted sampling of the full extent of the stellar IMF. This result persists after taking dust attenuation effects into account. We highlight the significance of stochastic effects in environments with low star formation activity and in studies describing systems associated with small physical scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is commonly assumed to be an invariant probability density distribution function of initial stellar masses. These initial stellar masses are generally represented by the canonical IMF, which is defined as the result of one star formation event in an embedded cluster. As a consequence, the galaxy-wide IMF (gwIMF) should also be invariant and of the same form as the canonical IMF; gwIMF is defined as the sum of the IMFs of all star-forming regions in which embedded clusters form and spawn the galactic field population of the galaxy. Recent observational and theoretical results challenge the hypothesis that the gwIMF is invariant. In order to study the possible reasons for this variation, it is useful to relate the observed IMF to the gwIMF. Starting with the IMF determined in resolved star clusters, we apply the IGIMF-theory to calculate a comprehensive grid of gwIMF models for metallicities, [Fe/H] (-3, 1), and galaxy-wide star formation rates (SFRs), SFR (10-5, 105) MO yr-1. For a galaxy with metallicity [Fe/H] {\textless} 0 and SFR {\textgreater} 1 MO yr-1, which is a common condition in the early Universe, we find that the gwIMF is both bottom light (relatively fewer low-mass stars) and top heavy (more massive stars), when compared to the canonical IMF. For a SFR {\textless} 1 MO yr-1 the gwIMF becomes top light regardless of the metallicity. For metallicities [Fe/H] {\textgreater} 0 the gwIMF can become bottom heavy regardless of the SFR. The IGIMF models predict that massive elliptical galaxies should have formed with a gwIMF that is top heavy within the first few hundred Myr of the life of the galaxy and that it evolves into a bottom heavy gwIMF in the metal-enriched galactic centre. Using the gwIMF grids, we study the SFR-H$\alpha$ relation and its dependency on metallicity and the SFR. We also study the correction factors to the Kennicutt SFRK - H$\alpha$ relation and provide new fitting functions. Late-type dwarf galaxies show significantly higher SFRs with respect to Kennicutt SFRs, while star-forming massive galaxies have significantly lower SFRs than hitherto thought. This has implications for gas-consumption timescales and for the main sequence of galaxies. We explicitly discuss Leo P and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies.},

All stars previously known in the literature, having V {\textless} 16 mag within the central 2″ × 2″, were recovered. Visual companions (≥40 mas; 2000 au) were detected for the WN5h stars R136 a1 and a3. Photometry of the visual companion of a1 suggests it is of mid-O spectral type. Based on new photometric luminosities using the resolved Zorro imaging, the masses of the individual WN5h stars are estimated to be between 150 and 200 M ⊙ , lowering significantly the present-day masses of some of the most-massive stars known. These mass estimates are critical anchor points for establishing the stellar upper-mass function.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4+-0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful "recipes" for modelling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

abstract = {Clusters that form in total 103 ≲ N ≲ 105 stars (type II clusters) lose their gas within a dynamical time as a result of the photoionizing flux from O stars. Sparser (type I) clusters get rid of their residual gas on a time-scale longer or comparable to the nominal crossing time and thus evolve approximately adiabatically. This is also true for massive embedded clusters (type III) for which the velocity dispersion is larger than the sound speed of the ionized gas. On expelling their residual gas, type I and III clusters are therefore expected to lose a smaller fraction of their stellar component than type II clusters. We outline the effect this has on the transformation of the mass function of embedded clusters (ECMF), which is directly related to the mass function of star cluster-forming molecular cloud cores, to the 'initial' MF of bound gas-free star clusters (ICMF). The resulting ICMF has, for a featureless power-law ECMF, a turnover near 104.5 M⊙ and a peak near 103 M⊙. The peak lies close to the initial masses of the Hyades, Praesepe and Pleiades clusters. We also find that the entire Galactic population II stellar spheroid can be generated if star formation proceeded via embedded clusters distributed like a power-law MF with exponent 0.9 ≲ $\beta$ ≲ 2.6.},

abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5 M⊙ and near 0.08 M⊙. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices $\alpha$ are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by {\$}\backslashDelta{\$} {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} ≈ 0.5 between 0.1 and 1 M⊙ than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto {\&} Zoccali; Paresce {\&} De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'{e}}ndez {\&} Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

This general insight appears to hold for populations including present-day star formation in small molecular clouds, rich and dense massive star-clusters forming in giant clouds, through to ancient and metal-poor exotic stellar populations that may be dominated by dark matter.

These two results imply that galactic-field IMFs for early-type stars cannot, under any circumstances, be a Salpeter power law, but that they must have a steeper exponent, $\alpha$field ≳ 2.8.

It is usuallydescribed as being invariant, but evidence to the contrary has emerged: it appears to become top-heavy when the star-formation rate density surpasses aboutonaand it may become increasingly bottom-heavy withincreasing metallicity and in increasingly massive elliptical galaxies. Itdeclines quite steeply below about with brown dwarfs (BDs) and verymass stars having their own IMF. Themost massive star of mass m max formed in an embedded cluster with stellar mass Mecl correlates strongly with Mecl being a result of gravitation-driven but resource-limited growth and fragmentation-induced starvation. There is no convincing evidence whatsoeverthat massive stars do form in isolation. Massive stars form above a density threshold in embedded clusters which become saturated when which appears to be the canonical physical upper mass limit of stars. Super-canonical massive stars arise naturally due to stellar mergers induced bystellar–dynamical encounters in binary–rich very young dense clusters. Various methods of discretising a stellar population are introduced: optimal sampling leads to a mass distribution that perfectly represents the exact form of the desired IMF and the mmax Mecl relation, while random sampling results in statistical variations of the shape of the IMF. The observed mmax Mecl correlation and the small spread of IMF power–law indices together suggest that optimally sampling the IMF may be the more realistic description of star formation than random sampling from a universal IMF with a constant upper mass limit. Composite populations on galaxy scales, which are formed from manyscale star formatiom events, need to be described by the integrated galactic IMF. This IGIMF varies systematically from top–light to top–heavy in dependence of galaxy type and star formation rate, with dramatic implications for theories of galaxy formation and evolution.},

abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within ∼2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7{\%} of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90{\%}) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M⊙. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90{\%}) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

abstract = {In an effort to understand the factors that determine the initial mass function of stars, the available data on the mass spectra of young stars in different regions have been studied for possible correlations with the properties of the associated molecular clouds and the spatial distributions of the stars. There appear to be differences in the stellar mass spectra in different regions: for example in Taurus, where the molecular gas is relatively dispersed and the stars are in scattered small groups, the stars are predominantly of low mass, whereas in Orion, where the gas is in massive condensed clouds and the stars are mostly in a single large cluster, the mass spectrum is relatively depleted in low-mass stars. The most massive stars appear to form in the dense cores of forming clusters or associations, and the mass of the most massive young star increases systematically with the mass of the associated molecular cloud. The data are consistent with a picture in which molecular cloud cores grow by accretion and become progressively more massive and condensed, while forming stars in larger and more condensed clusters and with a mass spectrum that increasingly favours massive stars. In this picture the more massive stars form by accumulation processes, rather than by fragmentation, in the dense core regions of protoclusters. Stellar winds may play an important role in limiting the masses that forming stars can attain; if so, the maximum stellar mass should increase with the density of the ambient gas and with the amount of turbulence present, a prediction that is in agreement with observations.},

abstract = {We study the effect of time-dependent dust obscuration on synthetic ultraviolet line profiles of a young stellar population. If the youngest and most massive stars are more obscured than the older, less massive stars, the C IV lambda1550 and other stellar wind lines are significantly diluted with respect to a simple foreground screen model for the dust. We propose to use stellar wind lines as a probe of the dust-obscuration model instead of the previously employed nebular emission lines. Since purely stellar diagnostics are utilized, uncertain assumptions on the nebular properties are unnecessary. Photoionization models demonstrate that the C IV lambda1550 emission is typically dominated by stellar winds and nebular contamination is negligible. A first comparison with a galaxy sample observed with the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope favors a dust geometry affecting ionizing and nonionizing stars equally. We point out the need for higher quality data for a more rigorous comparison. The Hubble Space Telescope is capable of obtaining such data in the future.},

The HST images resolve features down to physical scales of 2{\`{E}}5 pc, revealing several young ($\backslash$10 Myr) star-forming complexes of various ionized gas morphologies (compact knots, complete or fragmentary shells) and sizes (D10{\`{E}}200 pc). Our results are consistent with a uniform set of evolutionary trends : The youngest, smaller, Ðlled regions that presumably are those just emerging from dense star-forming clouds tend to be of high excitation and are highly obscured. Evolved, larger shell-like regions have lower excitation and are less extincted owing to the action of stellar winds and supernovae. In at least one case we Ðnd evidence for induced star forma- tion, which has led to a two-stage starburst. Age estimates based on W(Ha) measurements do not agree with those inferred from wind-driven shell models of expanding H II regions. The most likely explanation for this e†ect is the existence of an B2 Myr delay in the formation of superbubbles caused by the pres- sure exerted by the high-density medium in which massive stars are born. We report the detection of a supernova remnant embedded in one of the two large H II complexes of NGC 4214. The dust in NGC 4214 is not located in a foreground screen but is physically associated with the warm ionized gas.},

abstract = {When calculating stellar initial mass functions ( IMFs) for young clusters, one has to take into account that (1) most massive stars are born in multiple systems, (2) most IMFs are derived from data that cannot resolve such systems, and (3) multiple chance superpositions between members are expected to happen if the cluster is too distant. In this article I use numerical experiments to model the consequences of those phenomena on the observed color-magnitude diagrams and the IMFs derived from them. Real multiple systems affect the observed or apparent massive-starMF slope little but can create a significant population of apparently ultramassive stars. Chance superpositions produce only small biases when the number of superimposed stars is low but, once a certain number threshold is reached, they can affect both the observed slope and the apparent stellar upper mass limit. I apply these experiments to two well known massive young clusters in the Local Group,NGC3603 andR136. In both cases I show that the observed population of starswithmasses above 120M? can be explained by the effects of unresolved objects, mostly real multiple systems for NGC 3603 and a combination ofreal and chance-alignment multiple systems for R136. Therefore, the case for the reality of a stellar up- permass limit at solar or near-solarmetallicities is strengthened, with a possible value even lower than 150M?.AnIMF slope somewhat flatter than Salpeter or Kroupa with ? between ?1.6 and?2.0 is derived for the central region ofNGC 3603, with a significant contribution to the uncertainty arising from the imprecise knowledge of the distance to the clus- ter. The IMF at the very center of R136 cannot be measured with the currently available data but the situation could change with new HST observations. Subject},

abstract = {Recently acquired WFC3 UV (F275W and F336W) imaging mosaics under the Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS), combined with archival ACS data of M51, are used to study the young star cluster (YSC) population of this interacting system. Our newly extracted source catalogue contains 2834 cluster candidates, morphologically classified to be compact and uniform in colour, for which ages, masses and extinction are derived. In this first work we study the main properties of the YSC population of the whole galaxy, considering a mass-limited sample. Both luminosity and mass functions follow a power-law shape with slope -2, but at high luminosities and masses a dearth of sources is observed. The analysis of the mass function suggests that it is best fitted by a Schechter function with slope -2 and a truncation mass at 1.00 ± 0.12 × 105 M⊙. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm this result and link the shape of the luminosity function to the presence of a truncation in the mass function. A mass limited age function analysis, between 10 and 200 Myr, suggests that the cluster population is undergoing only moderate disruption. We observe little variation in the shape of the mass function at masses above 1 × 104 M⊙ over this age range. The fraction of star formation happening in the form of bound clusters in M51 is {\~{}}20 per cent in the age range 10-100 Myr and little variation is observed over the whole range from 1 to 200 Myr.},

We use the cluster catalogue produced by the Legacy ExtragalacticUVSurvey (LEGUS) collaboration to investigate cluster properties in the spiral galaxy M51. We analyse the cluster population as a function of galactocentric distance and in arm and inter-arm regions. The cluster mass function exhibits a similar shape at all radial bins, described by a power law with a slope close to -2 and an exponential truncation around 105 M⊙. While the mass functions of the YSCs in the spiral arm and inter-arm regions have similar truncation masses, the inter-arm region mass function has a significantly steeper slope than the one in the arm region, a trend that is also observed in the giant molecular cloud mass function and predicted by simulations. The age distribution of clusters is dependent on the region considered, and is consistent with rapid disruption only in dense regions, while little disruption is observed at large galactocentric distances and in the inter-arm region. The fraction of stars forming in clusters does not show radial variations, despite the drop in the H2 surface density measured as a function of galactocentric distance. We suggest that the higher disruption rate observed in the inner part of the galaxy is likely at the origin of the observed flat cluster formation efficiency radial profile.},

abstract = { Using recently acquired Hubble Space Telescope NIR observations ( J , Pa $\beta$ , and H bands) of the nearby galaxy NGC 1313, we investigate the timescales required by a young star cluster to emerge from its natal cloud. We search for extincted star clusters, potentially embedded in their natal cloud as either (1) compact sources in regions with high H $\alpha$ /Pa $\beta$ extinctions or (2) compact H ii regions that appear as point-like sources in the Pa $\beta$ emission map. The NUV–optical–NIR photometry of the candidate clusters is used to derive their ages, masses, and extinctions via a least- $\chi$ 2 spectral energy distribution broad- and narrowband fitting process. The 100 clusters in the final samples have masses in the range       and moderate extinctions, E ( B − V ) ≲ 1.0 mag. Focusing on the young clusters (0–6 Myr), we derive a weak correlation between extinction and age of the clusters. Almost half of the clusters have low extinctions, E ( B − V ) {\textless} 0.25 mag, already at very young ages (≤3 Myr), suggesting that dust is quickly removed from clusters. A stronger correlation is found between the morphology of the nebular emission (compact, partial or absent, both in H $\alpha$ and Pa $\beta$ ) and cluster age. Relative fractions of clusters associated with a specific nebular morphology are used to estimate the typical timescales for clearing the natal gas cloud, resulting in between 3 and 5 Myr, ∼1 Myr older than what was estimated from NUV–optical-based cluster studies. This difference hints at a bias for optical-only-based studies, which James Webb Space Telescope will address in the coming years. },

abstract = {Many of the results in modern astrophysics rest on the notion that the initial mass function (IMF) is universal. Our observations of a sample of H i selected galaxies in the light of H$\alpha$ and the far-ultraviolet (FUV) challenge this result. The extinction-corrected flux ratio FH$\alpha$/ fFUV from these two tracers of star formation shows strong correlations with the surface brightness in H$\alpha$ and the R band: low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies have lower FH$\alpha$/fFUV ratios compared to high surface brightness galaxies as well as compared to expectations from equilibrium models of constant star formation rate (SFR) using commonly favored IMF parameters. Weaker but significant correlations of F H$\alpha$/fFUV with luminosity, rotational velocity, and dynamical mass as well as a systematic trend with morphology, are found. The correlated variations of FH$\alpha$/fFUV with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family of galaxy scaling relations. The FH$\alpha$/fFUV correlations cannot be due to residual extinction correction errors, while systematic variations in the star formation history (SFH) cannot explain the trends with both H$\alpha$ and R surface brightness nor with other global properties. The possibility that LSB galaxies have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photons seems inconsistent with their high gas fraction, and observations of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of a few systems which indicate a real deficit of O stars. The most plausible explanation for the correlations is the systematic variations of the upper mass limit Mu and/or the slope $\gamma$ which define the upper end of the IMF. We outline a scenario of pressure driving the correlations by setting the efficiency of the formation of the dense star clusters where the highest mass stars preferentially form. Our results imply that the SFR measured in a galaxy is highly sensitive to the tracer used in the measurement. A nonuniversal IMF would also call into question the interpretation of metal abundance patterns in dwarf galaxies as well as SFHs derived from CMDs. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {We examine the initial mass function (IMF) and time history of the stellar birthrate in the solar neighborhood assuming a time-independent IMF. The present-day mass function is con- structed from the luminosity function, and a discussion of all the relevant observational quantities (luminosity function, mass-luminosity relation, scale heights, correction for non-main-sequence stars, and correction for main-sequence brightening) and the associated uncertainties is given. The observed total mass is not in serious disagreement with the dynamical mass (Oort limit) when the uncertainties are considered, and so there is no strong evidence for a local “missing mass” problem. The primary constraint on the birthrate history is the requirement that the derived IMF not exhibit an unphysical discontinuity at the mass where the main-sequence lifetime equals the age of the galactic disk. Considering the above uncertainties, the average past birthrate may be at most about 5 times larger or 3 times smaller than the present birthrate according to this constraint, and we favor a variation of less than a factor of 2. A discussion of 12 secondary con- straints on the birthrate history is given, and it is concluded that these constraints are either consistent with the continuity constraint or else indeterminate. There is, in particular, no evidence for a birthrate which depends on the square of the mean gas density. If the birthrate depends on some power of the mean gas density, the exponent must be small ({\textless}0.5). Theoretical models for the birthrate history are also examined. Most theories predict birthrates which are expected to be constant or change by relatively small amounts over the history of the disk, in agreement with the observational evidence. IMFs are derived for a range of birthrate histories consistent with the continuity constraint. The resulting IMFs are smooth and can be well approximated by a half-Gaussian distribution in log M; i.e., mass is distributed lognormally. The slope of the IMF at a given mass is d$\backslash$og {\pounds}1 dlogM = — (1 + log M). Tables of various useful quantities such as cumulative number and mass distributions, present birthrates, and mass consumption rates are given. The present total rate of mass consumption is found to lie between 3 and 7 x 10"9 MQ pc-2 yr-1. The correspond- ing time scales for gas depletion suggest that star formation is balanced by infall and/or that the star formation rate is partly controlled by stochastic factors such as supernova explosions or galactic encounters. The derived field star IMF is compared with previous determinations, the available data on open clusters and associations, and theoretical models for the IMF. Within the observational uncertainties, the cluster IMF agrees with the field star IMF for 1 M0 {\textless} M {\textless} 10 Mq, but some clusters are deficient in lower-mass stars. The IMF of the Orion OBI association agrees well with the field star IMF for M {\textgreater} 2.5 Me. Various theoretical models for the mass distribution resulting from fragmentation agree roughly with the shape of the IMF for Af {\textgreater} 2 MQ. The main deficiency of these models of fragmentation is their inability to account for the flattening of the observed IMF at low masses or the low-mass turnovers seen in some open cluster IMFs. Models in which the mass distribution is controlled by interactions of fragments with each other and with ambient gas are more successful in accounting for these two features. Finally, we summarize observational and theoretical arguments concerning the basic assumptions of this paper that the IMF is independent of time and a continuous function of mass.},

abstract = {We suggest that the intrinsic, stellar initial mass function (IMF) follows a power-law slope $\gamma$ = 2, inherited from hierarchical fragmentation of molecular clouds into clumps and clumps into stars. The well-known, logarithmic Salpeter slope $\Gamma$ = 1.35 in clusters is then the aggregate slope for all the star-forming clumps contributing to an individual cluster, and it is steeper than the intrinsic slope within individual clumps because the smallest star-forming clumps contributing to any given cluster are unable to form the highest-mass stars. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the Salpeter power-law index is the limiting value obtained for the cluster IMF when the lower-mass limits for allowed stellar masses and star-forming clumps are effectively equal, m lo = M lo. This condition indeed is imposed for the high-mass IMF tail by the turnover at the characteristic value mc 1 M . IMF slopes of $\Gamma$ 2 are obtained if the stellar and clump upper-mass limits are also equal m up = M up 100 M, and so our model explains the observed range of IMF slopes between $\Gamma$ 1 and 2. Flatter slopes of $\Gamma$ = 1 are expected when M lo {\textgreater} m up, which is a plausible condition in starbursts, where such slopes are suggested to occur. While this model is a simplistic parameterization of the star formation process, it seems likely to capture the essential elements that generate the Salpeter tail of the IMF for massive stars. These principles also likely explain the integrated galaxy IMF (IGIMF) effect seen in low-density star-forming environments. {\textcopyright} 2011. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {We use the first data release from the SINGG H-alpha survey of HI-selected galaxies to study the quantitative behavior of the diffuse, warm ionized medium (WIM) across the range of properties represented by these 109 galaxies. The mean fraction f{\_}WIM of diffuse ionized gas in this sample is 0.59+/- 0.19, slightly higher than found in previous samples. Since lower surface-brightness galaxies tend to have higher f{\_}WIM, we believe that most of this difference is due to selection effects favoring large, optically-bright, nearby galaxies with high star-formation rates. As found in previous studies, there is no appreciable correlation with Hubble type or total star-formation rate. However, we find that starburst galaxies, defined here by an H-alpha surface brightness {\textgreater} 2.5x 10{\^{}}39 erg s{\^{}}-1 kpc{\^{}}-2 within the H-alpha half-light radius, do show much lower fractions of diffuse H-alpha emission. The cause apparently is not dominated by a lower fraction of field OB stars. However, it is qualitatively consistent with an expected escape of ionizing radiation above a threshold star-formation rate, predicted from our model in which the ISM is shredded by pressure-driven supernova feedback. The HI gas fractions in the starburst galaxies are also lower, suggesting that the starbursts are consuming and ionizing all the gas, and thus promoting regions of density-bounded ionization. If true, these effects imply that some amount of Lyman continuum radiation is escaping from most starburst galaxies, and that WIM properties and outflows from mechanical feedback are likely to be pressure-driven. However, in view of previous studies showing that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation is generally low, it is likely that other factors also drive the low fractions of diffuse ionized gas in starbursts.},

abstract = {We investigate the relationship of the H II region luminosity function (H II LF) to the H II region size distribution and density-wave triggering in grand-design spiral galaxies. We suggest that the differential nebular size distribution is described by a power law approximately of slope -4, with flattening at radii below {\~{}}130 pc. This contrasts with the conventional exponential description, but it is physically and quantitatively consistent with the typical observed value of -2 for the H II LF slope. To study H II LF evolution, we have developed an interactive code that computes spatial isochrones for the evolving loci of spiral density waves in disk galaxies. This allows comparison of the nebular spatial distribution with the spatial isochrones for simple rotation curve parameters. Our comparisons for four grand-design galaxies suggest that the corotation radius rco coincides with the outer ends of the star-forming arms. This value for rco yields the best spatial correspondence between the H II regions and the isochrones and also appears to yield a coincidence between the inner Lindblad resonance with the radial onset of star formation in the arms. Thus, we suggest that isochrones offer a new, simple, and effective technique for determining rco and thus the spiral pattern speed. However, application of the isochrones also demonstrates that the evolution of the nebular population is difficult to spatially isolate in these galaxies.},

abstract = {We exploit ionization-parameter mapping (IPM) as a powerful tool to measure the optical depth of star-forming H II regions. Our simulations using the photoionization code CLOUDY and our new, SURFBRIGHT surface-brightness simulator demonstrate that this technique can directly diagnose most density-bounded, optically thin nebulae using spatially resolved emission-line data. We apply this method to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), using the data from the Magellanic Clouds Emission Line Survey. We generate new H II region catalogs based on photoionization criteria set by the observed ionization structure in the [S II]/[O III] ratio and H$\alpha$ surface brightness. The luminosity functions from these catalogs generally agree with those from H$\alpha$-only surveys. We then use IPM to crudely classify all the nebulae into optically thick versus optically thin categories, yielding fundamental new insights into Lyman-continuum (LyC) radiation transfer. We find that in both galaxies, the frequency of optically thin objects correlates with H$\alpha$ luminosity, and that the numbers of these objects dominate above log L/(erg s-1) ≥ 37.0. The frequencies of optically thin objects are 40{\%} and 33{\%} in the LMC and SMC, respectively. Similarly, the frequency of optically thick regions correlates with H I column density, with optically thin objects dominating at the lowest N(H I). The integrated escape luminosity of ionizing radiation is dominated by the largest regions and corresponds to luminosity-weighted, ionizing escape fractions from the H II region population of ≥0.42 and ≥0.40 in the LMC and SMC, respectively. These values correspond to global galactic escape fractions of 4{\%} and 11{\%}, respectively. This is sufficient to power the ionization rate of the observed diffuse ionized gas in both galaxies. Since our optical depth estimates tend to be underestimates, and also omit the contribution from field stars without nebulae, our results suggest the possibility of significant galactic escape fractions of LyC radiation. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

We test the effect of StarcNet predictions on the inferred cluster properties by comparing multi-color luminosity functions and mass-age plots from catalogs produced by StarcNet and by human-labeling; distributions in luminosity, color, and physical characteristics of star clusters are similar for the human and ML classified samples. There are two advantages to the ML approach: (1) reproducibility of the classifications: the ML algorithm's biases are fixed and can be measured for subsequent analysis; and (2) speed of classification: the algorithm requires minutes for tasks that humans require weeks to months to perform.

abstract = {Although the stellar initial mass function (IMF) has only been directly determined in star clusters, it has been manifoldly applied on galaxy-wide scales. But taking the clustered nature of star formation into account the galaxy-wide IMF is constructed by adding all IMFs of all young star clusters leading to an integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF). The IGIMF is top-light compared to the canonical IMF in star clusters and steepens with decreasing total star formation rate (SFR). This discrepancy is marginal for large disc galaxies but becomes significant for Small Magellanic Cloud type galaxies and less massive ones. We here construct IGIMF-based relations between the total far- and near-ultraviolet luminosities of galaxies and the underlying SFR. We make the prediction that the H$\alpha$ luminosity of star-forming dwarf galaxies decreases faster with decreasing SFR than the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity.

Our sample of metal-rich H II regions with metallicities close to solar and higher reveal the presence of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in 27 objects from the blue WR bump (∼4680 {\AA}) and 15 additional candidate WR regions. This provides for the first time a large set of metal-rich WR regions. Approximately half (14) of the WR regions also show broad C IV $\lambda$5808 emission attributed to WR stars of the WC subtype. The simultaneous detection of C III $\lambda$5696 emission in 8 of them allows us to determine an average late WC subtype compatible with expectations for high metallicities. Combined with literature data, the metallicity trends of WR features and the WC/WN number ratio are discussed. The WR regions show quite clear trends between their observed WR features and the H$\beta$ emission line. Detailed synthesis models are presented to understand/interpret these observations. In contrast with earlier studies of low metallicity WR galaxies, both W(WR) and I(WR)/I(H$\beta$) are here found to be smaller than "standard" predictions from appropriate evolutionary synthesis models at corresponding metallicities. Various possibilities which could explain this discrepancy are discussed. The most likely solution is found with an improved prescription to predict the line emission from WN stars in synthesis models. The availability of a fairly large sample of metal-rich WR regions allows us to improve existing estimates of the upper mass cut-off of the IMF in a robust way and independently of detailed modeling: from the observed maximum H$\beta$ equivalent width of the WR regions we derive a lower limit for Mup of 60-90 M⊙ in the case of a Salpeter slope and larger values for steeper IMF slopes. This constitutes a lower limit on Mup as all observational effects known to affect potentially the H$\beta$ equivalent width can only reduce the observed W(H$\beta$). From our direct probe of the massive star content we conclude that there is at present no evidence for systematic variations of the upper mass cut-off of the IMF in metal-rich environments, in contrast to some claims based on indirect nebular diagnostics.},

abstract = {We present observational evidence that leakage of ionizing photons from star-forming regions can affect the quantification of the star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies. This effect could partially explain the differences between the SFR estimates using the far-ultraviolet (FUV) and the H$\alpha$ emission. We find that leakage could decrease the SFR(H$\alpha$)/SFR(FUV) ratio by up to 25per cent. The evidence is based on the observation that the SFR(H$\alpha$)/SFR(FUV) ratio is lower for objects showing a shell H$\alpha$ structure than for regions exhibiting a much more compact morphology. The study has been performed on three object samples: low-luminosity dwarf galaxies from the Local Volume Legacy survey, star-forming regions in the Large Magellanic Cloud and the nearby Local Group galaxy M33. For the three samples we find differences (1.1$\sigma$-1.4$\sigma$) between the SFR(H$\alpha$)/SFR(FUV) for compact and shell objects. Although leakage cannot entirely explain the observed trend of SFR(H$\alpha$)/SFR(FUV) ratios for systems with low SFR, we show that the mechanism can lead to different SFR estimates when using H$\alpha$ and FUV luminosities. Therefore, further study is needed to constrain the contribution of leakage to the low SFR(H$\alpha$)/SFR(FUV) ratios observed in dwarf galaxies and its impact on the H$\alpha$ flux as an SFR indicator in such objects. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {Context. Galactic chemical evolution models are useful tools for interpreting the large body of high-quality observational data on the chemical composition of stars and gas in galaxies that have become available in recent years. Aims. This is the second paper of a series that aims at quantifying the uncertainties in chemical evolution model predictions related to the underlying model assumptions. Specifically, it deals with the uncertainties due to the choice of the stellar yields. Methods. We adopted a widely used model for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy to test the effects of changing the stellar nucleosynthesis prescriptions on the predicted evolution of several chemical species. Up-to-date results from stellar evolutionary models were carefully taken into account. Results. We find that, except for a handful of elements whose nucleosynthesis in stars is well understood by now, large uncertainties still affect model predictions. This is especially true for the majority of the iron-peak elements, but also for much more abundant species such as carbon and nitrogen. The main causes of the mismatch we find among the outputs of different models assuming different stellar yields and among model predictions and observations are (i) the adopted location of the mass cut in models of type II supernova explosions; (ii) the adopted strength and extent of hot bottom burning in models of asymptotic giant branch stars; (iii) the neglection of the effects of rotation on the chemical composition of the stellar surfaces; (iv) the adopted rates of mass loss and of (v) nuclear reactions; and (vi) the different treatments of convection. Conclusions. Our results suggest that it is mandatory to include processes such as hot bottom burning in intermediate-mass stars and rotation in stars of all masses in accurate studies of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. In spite of their importance, both these processes still have to be better understood and characterized. As for massive stars, presupernova models computed with mass loss and rotation are available in the literature, but they still wait for a self-consistent coupling with the results of explosive nucleosynthesis computations. {\textcopyright} 2010 ESO.},

abstract = {The Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) is a multiwavelength Cycle 21 Treasury program on the Hubble Space Telescope. It studied 50 nearby star-forming galaxies in five bands from the near UV to the I-band, combining new Wide Field Camera 3 observations with archival Advanced Camera for Surveys data. LEGUS was designed to investigate how star formation occurs and develops on both small and large scales, and how it relates to the galactic environments. In this paper we present the photometric catalogs for all the apparently single stars identified in the 50 LEGUS galaxies. Photometric catalogs and mosaicked images for all filters are available for download. We present optical and near UV color-magnitude diagrams for all the galaxies. For each galaxy we derived the distance from the tip of the red giant branch. We then used the NUV color-magnitude diagrams to identify stars more massive than 14 Mo, and compared their number with the number of massive stars expected from the GALEX FUV luminosity. Our analysis shows that the fraction of massive stars forming in star clusters and stellar associations is about constant with the star formation rate. This lack of a relation suggests that the time scale for evaporation of unbound structures is comparable or longer than 10 Myr. At low star formation rates this translates to an excess of mass in clustered environments as compared to model predictions of cluster evolution, suggesting that a significant fraction of stars form in unbound systems.},

The hypothesis is made that stars move off the main sequence after burning about 10 per cent of their hydrogen mass and that stars have been created at a uniform rate in the solar neighborhood for the last five billion years. Using this hypothesis and the observed luminosity function, the rate of star creation as a function of stellar mass is calculated.

abstract = {Context. Recent studies have started to cast doubt on the assumption that most stars are formed in clusters. Observational studies of field stars and star cluster systems in nearby galaxies can lead to better constraints on the fraction of stars forming in clusters. Ultimately this may lead to a better understanding of star formation in galaxies, and galaxy evolution in general. Aims.We aim to constrain the amount of star formation happening in long-lived clusters for four galaxies through the homogeneous, simultaneous study of field stars and star clusters. Methods. Using HST/ACS and HST/WFPC2 images of the galaxies NGC 45, NGC 1313, NGC 5236, and NGC 7793, we estimate star formation histories by means of the synthetic CMD method. Masses and ages of star clusters are estimated using simple stellar population model fitting. Comparing observed and modeled luminosity functions, we estimate cluster formation rates. By randomly sampling the stellar initial mass function (SIMF), we construct artificial star clusters and quantify how stochastic effects influence cluster detection, integrated colors, and age estimates. Results. Star formation rates appear to be constant over the past 107-108 years within the fields covered by our observations. The number of clusters identified per galaxy varies, with a few detected massive clusters (M ≥ 105 Mȯ) and a few older than 1 Gyr. Among our sample of galaxies, NGC 5236 and NGC 1313 show high star and cluster formation rates, while NGC 7793 and NGC 45 show lower values.We find that stochastic sampling of the SIMF has a strong impact on the estimation of ages, colors, and completeness for clusters with masses ≤103-104 Mȯ, while the effect is less pronounced for high masses. Stochasticity also makes size measurements highly uncertain at young ages ($\tau$ ≤ 108 yr), making it difficult to distinguish between clusters and stars based on sizes. Conclusions.The ratio of star formation happening in clusters (G) compared to the global star formation appears to vary for different galaxies. We find similar values to previous studies (G ≈ 2{\%}-10{\%}), but we find no obvious relation between G and the star formation rate density ($\sigma$SFR) within the range probed here ($\sigma$SFR ∼ 10-3-10-2 Mȯ yr -1 kpc-2). The G values do, however, appear to correlate with the specific U-band luminosity (TL(U), the fraction of total light coming from clusters compared to the total U-band light of the galaxy). {\textcopyright} 2011 ESO.},

The color-magnitude diagram synthesis method is well established as the most accurate way to determine star-formation histories of galaxies back to the earliest times. This approach received a large boost from the exceptional data sets that wide-field CCD imagers on the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope could provide. Spectroscopic studies using large ground-based telescopes such as VIST, Magellan, Keck, and HET have allowed the determination of abundances and kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies. These studies have shown how the properties of stellar populations can vary spatially and temporally. This leads to important constraints to theories of galaxy formation and evolution. The combination of spectroscopy and imaging and whatthey have taught us about dwarf galaxy formation and evolution is die aim of this review. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by Annual Reviews.

Here we test this result by comparing the elliptical galaxy spectra to those of luminous globular clusters associated with M31. These globular clusters have similar metallicities, abundance ratios, and ages as massive elliptical galaxies but their low dynamical mass-to-light ratios rule out steep stellar initial mass functions (IMFs). From high-quality Keck spectra we find that the dwarf-sensitive absorption lines in globular clusters are significantly weaker than in elliptical galaxies and consistent with normal IMFs. The differences in the Na I and Wing-Ford indices are 0.027 ± 0.007mag and 0.017 ± 0.006mag, respectively. We directly compare the two classes of objects by subtracting the averaged globular cluster spectrum from the averaged elliptical galaxy spectrum. The difference spectrum is well fit by the difference between a stellar population synthesis model with a bottom-heavy IMF and one with a bottom-light IMF. We speculate that the slope of the IMF may vary with velocity dispersion, although it is not yet clear what physical mechanism would be responsible for such a relation. {\textcopyright} 2011.

abstract = {We present a thorough literature study of the most-massive star, m max, in several young star clusters in order to assess whether or not star clusters are populated from the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by random sampling over the mass range 0.01 ≤ m ≤ 150 M⊙ without being constrained by the cluster mass, Mecl. The data reveal a partition of the sample into lowest mass objects (Mecl ≤ 10 2 M⊙), moderate mass clusters (102 M ⊙ {\textless} Mecl ≤ 103 M⊙) and rich clusters above 103 M⊙. Additionally, there is a plateau of a constant maximal star mass (mmax ≈ 25 M ⊙) for clusters with masses between 103 M ⊙ and 4 × 103 M⊙. Statistical tests of this data set reveal that the hypothesis of random sampling from the IMF between 0.01 and 150 M⊙ is highly unlikely for star clusters more massive than 102 M⊙ with a probability of p ≈ 2 × 10-7 for the objects with Mecl between 102 and 103 M⊙ and p ≈ 3 × 10-9 for the more massive star clusters. Also, the spread of m max values at a given Mecl is smaller than expected from random sampling. We suggest that the basic physical process able to explain this dependence of stellar inventory of a star cluster on its mass may be the interplay between stellar feedback and the binding energy of the cluster-forming molecular cloud core. Given these results, it would follow that an integrated galactic IMF (IGIMF) sampled from such clusters would automatically be steeper in comparison to the IMF within individual star clusters. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

Here, it is shown by comparing the NGC 4214 results with observations from the Milky Way that NGC 4214 agrees very well with the predictions of the mmax-Mecl relation and with the integrated galactic stellar initial mass function theory. The difference in conclusions is based on a high degree of degeneracy between expectations from random sampling and those from the mmax-Mecl relation, but are also due to interpreting mmax as a truncation mass in a randomly sampled initial mass function.

abstract = {We consider the effects of non-constant star formation histories (SFHs) on H$\alpha$ and GALEX far-ultraviolet (FUV) star formation rate (SFR) indicators. Under the assumption of a fully populated Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), we compare the distribution of H$\alpha$-to-FUV flux ratios from ∼1500 simple, periodic model SFHs with observations of 185 galaxies from the Spitzer Local Volume Legacy survey. We find a set of SFH models that are well matched to the data, such that more massive galaxies are best characterized by nearly constant SFHs, while low-mass systems experience burst amplitudes of ∼30 (i.e., an increase in the SFR by a factor of 30 over the SFR during the inter-burst period), burst durations of tens of Myr, and periods of ∼250Myr; these SFHs are broadly consistent with the increased stochastic star formation expected in systems with lower SFRs. We analyze the predicted temporal evolution of galaxy stellar mass, R-band surface brightness, H$\alpha$-derived SFR, and blue luminosity, and find that they provide a reasonable match to observed flux distributions. We find that our model SFHs are generally able to reproduce both the observed systematic decline and increased scatter in H$\alpha$-to-FUV ratios toward low-mass systems, without invoking other physical mechanisms. We also compare our predictions with those from the Integrated Galactic IMF theory with a constant SFR. We find that while both predict a systematic decline in the observed ratios, only the time variable SFH models are capable of producing the observed population of low-mass galaxies (M * ≲ 10 7 M) with normal H$\alpha$-to-FUV ratios. These results demonstrate that a variable IMF alone has difficulty explaining the observed scatter in the H$\alpha$-to-FUV ratios. We conclude by considering the limitations of the model SFHs and discuss the use of additional empirical constraints to improve future SFH modeling efforts.},

By modeling the ensemble of clusters, we find the distribution of MF slopes is best described by $\Gamma$ = + 1.45+0.03-0.06 with a very small intrinsic scatter and no drastic outliers. This model allows the MF slope to depend on cluster mass, size, and age, but the data imply no significant dependencies within this regime of cluster properties. The lack of an age dependence suggests that the MF slope has not significantly evolved over the first ∼25 Myr and provides direct observational evidence that the measured MF represents the IMF. Taken together, this analysis - based on an unprecedented large sample of young clusters, homogeneously constructed CMDs, well-defined selection criteria, and consistent principled modeling - implies that the high-mass IMF slope in M31 clusters is universal. The IMF has a slope ($\Gamma$ = + 1.45+0.03-0.06; statistical uncertainties) that is slightly steeper than the canonical Kroupa (+1.30) and Salpeter (+1.35) values, and our measurement of it represents a factor of ∼20 improvement in precision over the Kroupa IMF (+1.30 ± 0.7). Using our inference model on select Milky Way (MW) and LMC high-mass IMF studies from the literature, we find $\Gamma$MW ∼ + 1.15 ± 0.1 and $\Gamma$LMC ∼ + 1.3 ± 0.1. both with intrinsic scatter of ∼0.3-0.4 dex. Thus, while the high-mass IMF in the Local Group may be universal, systematics in the literature of IMF studies preclude any definitive conclusions; homogenous investigations of the high-mass IMF in the local universe are needed to overcome this limitation. Consequently, the present study represents the most robust measurement of the high-mass IMF slope to date. To facilitate practical use over the full stellar mass spectrum, we have grafted the M31 high-mass IMF slope onto widely used sub-solar mass Kroupa and Chabrier IMFs. The increased steepness in the M31 high-mass IMF slope implies that commonly used UV- and H$\alpha$-based star formation rates should be increased by a factor of ∼1.3-1.5 and the number of stars with masses {\textgreater}8 M⊙ is ∼25{\%} fewer than expected for a Salpeter/Kroupa IMF.},

abstract = {The local stellar mass density is observed to be significantly lower than the value obtained from integrating the cosmic star formation history (SFH), assuming that all the stars formed with a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF). Even other favoured IMFs, more successful in reconciling the observed z = 0 stellar mass density with that inferred from the SFH, have difficulties in reproducing the stellar mass density observed at higher redshift. In this study, we investigate to what extent this discrepancy can be alleviated for any universal power-law IMF. We find that an IMF with a high-mass slope shallower (2.15) than the Salpeter slope (2.35) reconciles the observed stellar mass density with the cosmic SFH, but only at low redshifts. At higher redshifts z {\textgreater} 0.5, we find that the observed stellar mass densities are systematically lower than predicted from the cosmic SFH, for any universal power-law IMF. {\textcopyright} 2008 RAS.},

@article{Yan2017,
abstract = {Here we present a full description of the integrated galaxy-wide initial mass function (IGIMF) theory in terms of the optimal sampling and compare it with available observations. Optimal sampling is the method we use to discretize the IMF deterministically into stellar masses. Evidence indicates that nature may be closer to deterministic sampling as observations suggest a smaller scatter of various relevant observables than random sampling would give, which may result from a high level of self-regulation during the star formation process. We document the variation of IGIMFs under various assumptions. The results of the IGIMF theory are consistent with the empirical relation between the total mass of a star cluster and the mass of its most massive star, and the empirical relation between the star formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy and the mass of its most massive cluster. Particularly, we note a natural agreement with the empirical relation between the IMF power-law index and the SFR of a galaxy. The IGIMF also results in a relation between the SFR of a galaxy and the mass of its most massive star such that, if there were no binaries, galaxies with SFR {\textless} 10-4M /yr should host no Type II supernova events. In addition, a specific list of initial stellar masses can be useful in numerical simulations of stellar systems. For the first time, we show optimally sampled galaxy-wide IMFs (OSGIMF) that mimic the IGIMF with an additional serrated feature. Finally, a Python module, GalIMF, is provided allowing the calculation of the IGIMF and OSGIMF dependent on the galaxy-wide SFR and metallicity.},

abstract = {Growing evidence in recent years suggests a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function (IMF), being top-heavy for starburst galaxies and possibly bottom-heavy for massive ellipticals. Galaxy chemical evolution simulations adopting an invariant canonical IMF face difficulty in simultaneously reproducing the metallicity and $\alpha$-enhancement of the massive elliptical galaxies. Applying a variable IMF that changes with time is a promising solution, however, it is non-trivial to couple a variable IMF theory with the existing galaxy evolution codes. Here we present the first open source simulation code which recalculates the galaxy-wide IMF at each time step according to the integrated galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory where the galaxy-wide IMF depends on the galactic star formation rate and metallicity. The resulting galaxy-wide IMF and metal abundance evolve with time. With this pilot work, we explore the effect of the IGIMF theory on galaxy chemical evolution in comparison with an invariant IMF.},

abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the high-redshift universe, and may be able to test the prediction that the first, chemically pristine (PopulationIII) stars are formed with very high characteristic masses. Since isolated PopulationIII stars are likely to be beyond the reach of JWST, small PopulationIII galaxies may offer the best prospects of directly probing the properties of metal-free stars. Here, we present Yggdrasil, a new spectral synthesis code geared toward the first galaxies. Using this model, we explore the JWST imaging detection limits for PopulationIII galaxies and investigate to what extent such objects may be identified based on their JWST colors. We predict that JWST should be able to detect PopulationIII galaxies with stellar population masses as low as 10 5 M ∞ at z 10 in ultra deep exposures. Over limited redshift intervals, it may also be possible to use color criteria to select PopulationIII galaxy candidates for follow-up spectroscopy. The colors of young PopulationIII galaxies dominated by direct starlight can be used to probe the stellar initial mass function (IMF), but this requires almost complete leakage of ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium. The colors of objects dominated by nebular emission show no corresponding IMF sensitivity. We also note that a clean selection of PopulationIII galaxies at z 7-8 can be achieved by adding two JWST/MIRI filters to the JWST/NIRCam filter sets usually discussed in the context of JWST ultra deep fields. {\textcopyright} 2011.
