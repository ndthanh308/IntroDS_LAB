abstract = {Previous research into three-dimensional numerical simulation of self-similar mixing due to Rayleigh–Taylor instability is summarized. A range of numerical approaches has been used: direct numerical simulation, implicit large eddy simulation and large eddy simulation with an explicit model for sub-grid-scale dissipation. However, few papers have made direct comparisons between the various approaches. The main purpose of the current paper is to give comparisons of direct numerical simulations and implicit large eddy simulations using the same computational framework. Results are shown for four test cases: (i) single-mode Rayleigh– Taylor instability, (ii) self-similar Rayleigh–Taylor mixing, (iii) three-layer mixing and (iv) a tilted-rig Rayleigh–Taylor experiment. It is found that both approaches give similar results for the high-Reynolds number behavior. Direct numerical simulation is needed to assess the influence of finite Reynolds number.},

abstract = {We investigate the miscible Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability in both 2 and 3 dimensions using direct numerical simulations, where the working fluid is assumed incompressible under the Boussinesq approximation. We first consider the case of randomly perturbed interfaces. With a variety of diagnostics, we develop a physical picture for the detailed temporal development of the mixed layer: We identify three distinct evolutionary phases in the development of the mixed layer, which can be related to detailed variations in the growth of the mixing zone. Our analysis provides an explanation for the observed differences between two and three-dimensional RT instability; the analysis also leads us to concentrate on the RT models which (1) work equally well for both laminar and turbulent flows, and (2) do not depend on turbulent scaling within the mixing layer between fluids. These candidate RT models are based on point sources within bubbles (or plumes) and interaction with each other (or the background flow). With this motivation, we examine the evolution of single plumes, and relate our numerical results (of single plumes) to a simple analytical model for plume evolution.},

@article{Wang2004,
abstract = {A thermodynamically consistent and fully conservative (TCFC) treatment of contact discontinuities (designated as TCFC model in this paper) is proposed for the simulation of compressible multicomponent flows with shock-interface interactions, yielding an accurate capture of contact discontinuities. Starting from the total energy equation of the mixture, a new formulation is developed to define the ratio of specific heats of the mixture, and a governing equation in conservative form for the pressure is subsequently obtained. Another formulation is derived to determine the molecular weight of the mixture from classical thermodynamics. The governing equations in conservative form are further derived to calculate the specific heats ratio and the molecular weight of the mixture with their new formulations and the continuity or mass fraction equations for the individual components. Finally, the governing equations for the ratio of specific heats, the molecular weight and the pressure, combined with the continuity and momentum equations, offer the new hyperbolic conservation laws for the description of multicomponent or multifluid flows with shock-interface interactions. A simple version of the model is also developed without solving the governing equation for the molecular weight of the mixture. A brief analysis of the numerical uncertainties of conventional conservation models and the present TCFC models is presented and the consistency of any additional equation derived within any model with the initial governing equations is investigated. An analysis of the proposed TCFC model and the conventional conservative models is also performed on the pressure evolution for a mixture associated with isolated contact discontinuities. The results show that the present TCFC model produces a uniform pressure field and thus the pressure maintains in equilibrium across the material interfaces. The proposed TCFC model is then implemented into a Godunov-type method based upon a fast, exact Riemann solver. Several multicomponent flow problems with both strong and weak shocks are simulated using this new model and conventional conservation models, and comparisons of the numerical results from the various models and, where possible, exact solutions are performed. It is shown that the proposed TCFC model can handle both strong and weak shocks, and that the numerical solutions are completely oscillation-free through the contact discontinuities. This new approach offers a suitable treatment of contact discontinuities for compressible multicomponent flows and also maintains all the favorable features of fully conservative conservation laws. It belongs to the conservative approaches and is independent of numerical schemes. From the analysis of the numerical uncertainties of several models proposed in the past and the present numerical experiments, it is determined that the conservative or non-conservative form of some additional governing equations is not the ultimate reason that produces oscillating solutions near the material interfaces. The main cause of the oscillating solutions with conventional conservation models is the inappropriate determination of the ratio of specific heats of the mixture. Oscillation-free results are obtained for two test cases with weak shocks even with conventional conservation models using the present Godunov-type method based on a fast exact Riemann solver. This suggests that the problems with weak shocks and strong post-shock contact discontinuities are not suitable for the model validation in multicomponent flows. The capability of handling strong shocks and weak post-shock contact discontinuities is more critical to the demonstration of any model for compressible multicomponent or multifluid flows. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Two-dimensional simulations of the single-mode Richtmyer–Meshkov instability (RMI) are conducted and compared to experimental results of Jacobs and Krivets (2005 Phys. Fluids 17 034105). The employed adaptive central-upwind sixth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme (Hu X Y et al 2010 J. Comput. Phys. 229 8952–65) introduces only very small numerical dissipation while preserving the good shock-capturing properties of other standard WENO schemes. Hence, it is well suited for simulations with both small-scale features and strong gradients. A generalized Roe average is proposed to make the multicomponent model of Shyue (1998 J. Comput. Phys. 142 208–42) suitable for high-order accurate reconstruction schemes. A first sequence of single-fluid simulations is conducted and compared to the experiment. We find that the WENO-CU6 method better resolves small-scale structures, leading to earlier symmetry breaking and increased mixing. The first simulation, however, fails to correctly predict the global characteristic structures of the RMI. This is due to a mismatch of the post-shock parameters in single-fluid simulations when the pre-shock states are matched with the experiment. When the post-shock parameters are matched, much better agreement with the experimental data is achieved. In a sequence of multifluid simulations, the uncertainty in the density gradient associated with transition between the fluids is assessed. Thereby the multifluid simulations show a considerable improvement over the single-fluid simulations. PACS number: xxx (Some figures may appear in colour only in the online journal)},

abstract = {The variable-density spectral kinetic energy budget for the Richtmyer-Meshkov-induced turbulent mixing layer is presented using results from a 5123 implicit large eddy simulation. The budget is presented at several time instants and as a function of the inhomogeneous direction as the layer transitions from the initial impulse through to self-similarity. There are clear parallels in the development of the mixing layer with a previous analysis for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In the core of the layer, the quadratic terms are largely negative in the energy-containing scales. The transfer spectra are clearly asymmetric, where the majority of the activity occurrs on the spike side. The quadratic and pressure components are of opposite sign and almost cancel each other out in the spikes. The dilatational terms are negligible in comparison to the difference between the quadratic and pressure transfer. A notable result is that vortex rings are identified as the key source of alternating fields of negative and positive energy transfer within the mixing layer. This helps explain similar observations noted in direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Finally, the spectral numerical dissipation for this scheme is computed for the self-similar layer. This demonstrated that the effects of numerical dissipation are small compared to the other terms at low wave numbers, whereas at higher wave numbers where modes become significantly underresolved the numerical dissipation is approximately twice the nonlinear transfer term and behaves in approximate analogy to an effective spectral eddy viscosity.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Inc. Typical multispecies compressible Navier–Stokes computations employ conservative equations for mass fraction transport. Upwind discretisations of these governing equations produce spurious pressure oscillations at diffuse contact surfaces between gases of differing ratio of specific heat capacities which degrade the convergence rate of the algorithm. Adding quasi-conservative equations for volume fraction can solve this error, however this approach has been derived only for immiscible fluids. Here, a five-equation quasi-conservative model is proposed that includes the effects of species diffusion, viscosity and thermal conductivity. The derivation of the model is presented, along with a numerical method to solve the governing equations at second order accuracy in space and time. Formal convergence studies demonstrate the expected order of accuracy is achieved for three benchmark problems, cross-validated against two standard mass fraction models. In these test cases, the new model has between 2 and 10 times lower error for a given grid size. Simulations of a two-dimensional air-SF6 Richtmyer–Meshkov instability demonstrate that the new model converges to the solution with four times fewer points in each direction when compared to the mass fraction model in an identical numerical framework. This represents an ≈40 times lower computational cost for an equivalent error in two-dimensional computations. The proposed model is thus very suitable for Direct Numerical Simulation and Large Eddy Simulation of compressible mixing.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the influence of different three-dimensional multi-mode initial conditions on the rate of growth of a mixing layer initiated via a Richtmyer–Meshkov instability through a series of well-controlled numerical experiments. Results are presented for large-eddy simulation of narrowband and broadband perturbations at grid resolutions up to 3×10 9 points using two completely different numerical methods, and comparisons are made with theory and experiment. It is shown that the mixing-layer growth is strongly dependent on initial conditions, the narrowband case giving a power-law exponent $\theta$ ≈ 0.26 at low Atwood and $\theta$ ≈ 0.3 at high Atwood numbers. The broadband case uses a perturbation power spectrum of the form P (k) ∝ k −2 with a proposed theoretical growth rate of $\theta$ = 2/3. The numerical results confirm this; however, they highlight the necessity of a very fine grid to capture an appropriately broad range of initial scales. In addition, an analysis of the kinetic energy decay rates, fluctuating kinetic energy spectra, plane-averaged volume fraction profiles and mixing parameters is presented for each case.},

The governing equations, turbulence modelling and numerical methods are presented in full. The new numerical method is validated against direct numerical simulation (DNS) data for a lean premixed methane slot burner. Although the modelling approaches are based on non-premixed flames and hence not expected to be valid for a wide range of premixed flames, the predicted flame is just 10{\%} longer than that in the DNS and excellent agreement of mean mass fractions, conditional mass fractions and temperature is demonstrated. This new numerical method provides a very useful framework for future application of CMC to premixed as well as non-premixed combustion. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = { The Rayleigh–Taylor instability induced turbulence is studied under the Boussinesq approximation focusing on vorticity and mixing. A direct numerical simulation has been carried out with an auto-adaptive multidomain Chebyshev–Fourier–Fourier numerical method. The spatial resolution is increased up to {\$}(24\backslashtimes 40)\backslashtimes 940{\^{}}2=848\backslash,M{\$} collocation points. The Taylor Reynolds number is {\$}\backslashmathitRe{\_}\backslashunicode[STIX]x1D706{\_}zz\backslashapprox 142{\$} and a short inertial range is observed. The nonlinear growth rate of the turbulent mixing layer is found to be close to {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]x1D6FC{\_}b=0.021{\$} . Our conclusions may be summarized as follows.  (i) The simulation data are in agreement with the scalings for the pressure ( {\$}k{\^{}}-7/3{\$} ) and the vertical mass flux ( {\$}k{\^{}}-7/3{\$} ). (ii) Mean quantities have a self-similar behaviour, but some inhomogeneity is still present. For higher-order quantities the self-similar regime is not fully achieved. (iii) In the self-similar regime, the mean dissipation rate and the enstrophy behave as {\$}\backslashlangle \backslashoverline\backslashunicode[STIX]x1D700\backslashrangle \backslashpropto t{\$} and {\$}\backslashlangle \backslashoverline\backslashunicode[STIX]x1D714{\_}i\backslash,\backslashunicode[STIX]x1D714{\_}i{\^{}}1/2\backslashrangle \backslashpropto t{\^{}}1/2{\$} , respectively. (iv) The large-scale velocity fluctuation probability density function (PDF) is Gaussian, while vorticity and dissipation PDFs show large departures from Gaussianity.(v) The pressure PDF exhibits strong departures from Gaussianity and is skewed. This is related to vortex coherent structures.(vi) The intermediate scales of the mixing are isotropic, while small scales remain anisotropic. This leaves open the possibility of a small-scale buoyancy. Velocity intermediate scales are also isotropic, while small scales remain anisotropic. Mixing and dynamics are therefore consistent.(vii) Properties and behaviours of vorticity and enstrophy are detailed. In particular, equations for these quantities are written down under the Boussinesq approximation.(viii) The concentration PDF is quasi-Gaussian. The vertical concentration gradient is both non-Gaussian and strongly skewed.},

@article{Schilling2007,
abstract = {The ninth-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) shock-capturing method is used to investigate the physics of reshock and mixing in two-dimensional single-mode Richtmyer-Meshkov instability to late times. The initial conditions and computational domain were adapted from the Mach 1.21 air (acetone)/ SF6 shock tube experiment of Collins and Jacobs [J. Fluid Mech. 464, 113 (2002)]: the growth of the bubble and spike amplitudes from fifth- and ninth-order WENO simulations of this experiment were compared to the predictions of linear and nonlinear amplitude growth models, and were shown to be in very good agreement with the experimental data prior to reshock by Latini, Schilling, and Don [Phys. Fluids 19, 024104 (2007)]. In the present investigation, the density, vorticity, baroclinic vorticity production, and simulated density Schlieren fields are first presented to qualitatively describe the reshock process. The baroclinic circulation deposition on the interface is shown to agree with the predictions of the Samtaney-Zabusky model and with linear instability theory. The time evolution of the positive and negative circulation on the interface is considered before and after reshock: it is shown that the magnitudes of the circulations are equal before as well as after reshock, until the interaction of the reflected rarefaction with the layer induces flow symmetry breaking and different evolutions of the magnitude of the positive and negative circulation. The post-reshock mixing layer growth is shown to be in generally good agreement with three models predicting linear growth for a short time following reshock. Next, a comprehensive investigation of local and global mixing properties as a function of time is performed. The distribution and amount of mixed fluid along the shock propagation direction is characterized using averaged mole fraction profiles, a fast kinetic reaction model, and mixing fractions. The modal distribution of energy in the mixing layer is quantified using the spectra of the fluctuating kinetic energy, fluctuating enstrophy, pressure variance, density variance, and baroclinic vorticity production variance. It is shown that a broad range of scales already exists prior to reshock, indicating that the single-mode Richtmyer-Meshkov instability develops nontrivial spectral content from its inception. The comparison of the spectra to the predictions of classical inertial subrange scalings in two-dimensional turbulence shows that the post-reshock spectra may be consistent with many of these scalings over wave number ranges less than a decade. At reshock, fluctuations in all fields (except for the density) are amplified across all scales. Reshock strongly amplifies the circulation, profiles, and mixing fractions, as well as the energy spectra and statistics, leading to enhanced mixing followed by a decay. The mole and mixing fraction profiles become nearly self-similar at late times following reshock; the mixing fraction exhibits an approach toward unity across the layer at the latest time, signifying nearly complete mixing of the gases. To directly quantify the amplification of fluctuations by reshock, the previously considered quantities are compared immediately after and before reshock. Finally, to investigate the decay of fluctuations in the absence of additional waves interacting with the mixing layer following reshock, the boundary condition at the end of the computational domain is changed from reflecting to outflow to allow the reflected rarefaction wave to exit the domain. It is demonstrated that the reflected rarefaction has an important role in breaking symmetry and achieving late-time statistical isotropy of the velocity field.},

This enables quantitative agreement with the first and second moments of turbulence statistics measured in the experiment. LES is used to perform the analysis since experimental measurements of time-resolved 3D fields are still in their infancy and because sampling periods are generally limited with direct numerical simulation. A major focal point is the comprehensive characterization of the turbulence scales and their evolution. Time-resolved probes are used with long sampling periods to obtain maps of the integral scales, Taylor microscales, and turbulent kinetic energy spectra. Scalar-fluctuation scales are also quantified. In the near-field, coherent structures are clearly identified, both in physical and spectral space. Along the jet centerline, turbulence scales grow according to a classical one-third power law. However, the derived maps of turbulence scales reveal strong inhomogeneities in the flow. From the modeling perspective, these insights are useful to design optimized grids and improve numerical predictions in similar configurations.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations and a self-similar analysis of the single-fluid Boussinesq Rayleigh{\&}ndash;Taylor instability and transition to turbulence are used to investigate Rayleigh{\&}ndash;Taylor turbulence. The Schmidt, Atwood and bulk Reynolds numbers are $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}Sc\backslash\backslash,=\backslash\backslash,1\backslash\backslash{\$}, $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}A\backslash\backslash,=\backslash\backslash,0.01\backslash\backslash{\$}, $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}Re \backslash\backslash,\backslash\backslashle\backslash\backslash, 3000\backslash\backslash{\$}. High-Reynolds-number moment self-similarity, consistent with the the energy cascade interpretation of dissipation, is used to analyse the DNS results. The mixing layer width obeys a differential equation with solution $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}h(t;C{\_}o,h{\_}0)\backslash\backslash,=\backslash\backslash,\backslash\backslashfourth C{\_}o Agt{\^{}}2+ \backslash\backslashsqrtAgC{\_}oh{\^{}}1/2{\_}0 t+h{\_}0\backslash\backslash{\$}; the result for $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}h(t;C{\_}o,h{\_}0)\backslash\backslash{\$} is a rigorous consequence of only one ansatz, self-similarity. It indicates an intermediate time regime in which the growth is linear and the importance of a virtual origin. At long time the well-known $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}h \backslash\backslashsim \backslash\backslashfourth C{\_}o Agt{\^{}}2\backslash\backslash{\$} scaling dominates. The self-similar analysis indicates that the asymptotic growth rate is not universal. The scalings of the second-order moments, their dissipations, and production{\&}ndash;dissipation ratios, are obtained and compared to the DNS. The flow is not self-similar in a conventional sense {\&}ndash; there is no single length scale that scales the flow. The moment similarity method produces three different scalings for the turbulence energy-containing length scale, $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}\backslash\backslashell\backslash\backslash{\$}, the Taylor microscale, $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}\backslash\backslashla\backslash\backslash{\$}, and the Kolmogorov dissipation scale, $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}\backslash\backslasheta\backslash\backslash{\$}. The DNS and the self-similar analysis are in accord showing $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}\backslash\backslashell \backslash\backslash,\backslash\backslashsim\backslash\backslash, Agt{\^{}}2\backslash\backslash{\$}, $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}\backslash\backslashla \backslash\backslash,\backslash\backslashsim\backslash\backslash, t{\^{}}1/2\backslash\backslash{\$} and $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}\backslash\backslasheta \backslash\backslash,\backslash\backslashsim\backslash\backslash, ((A{\^{}}2g{\^{}}2/\backslash\backslashnu{\^{}}3)t){\^{}}-1/4\backslash\backslash{\$} achieving self-similar behaviour within three initial eddy turnovers of the inception of the turbulence growth phase at bulk Reynolds numbers in the range of $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}\backslash\backslashit Re\backslash\backslash,=\backslash\backslash,800\backslash\backslash{\$}{\&}ndash;1000 depending on initial conditions. A picture of a turbulence in which the largest scales grow, asymptotically, as $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}t{\^{}}2\backslash\backslash{\$} and the smallest scales decrease as $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}t{\^{}}-1/4\backslash\backslash{\$}, emerges. As a consequence the bandwidth of the turbulence spectrum grows as $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}t{\^{}}9/4\backslash\backslash{\$} and is consistent with the $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}R{\_}t{\^{}}3/4\backslash\backslash{\$} Kolmogorov scaling law of fully developed stationary turbulent flows. While not all moments are consistent, especially the dissipations and higher-order moments in the edge regions, with the self-similar results it appears possible to conclude that: (i) the turbulence length scales evolve as a power of $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}h(t;C{\_}o,h{\_}0)\backslash\backslash{\$}; (ii) $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}\backslash\backslashal\backslash\backslash{\$}, as demonstrated mathematically for self-similar Rayleigh{\&}ndash;Taylor turbulence and numerically by the DNS, is not a universal constant; (iii) there is statistically significant correlation between decreasing $\backslash$$\backslash${\$}\backslash\backslashalpha\backslash\backslash{\$} and lower low-wavenumber loading of the initial spectrum.},

abstract = {A single parameter numerical study of the evolution of the multimode planar Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) in a shocked/reshocked (air-SF6, Atwood number A = 0.67) configuration with a Mach number Ma = 1.5 shock is carried out. Our results demonstrate that the initial material interface morphology (for fixed Ma, A) controls the RMI evolution characteristics. Our discussion focuses on the light-to-heavy configuration with initial A {\textgreater}0 and heavy-to-light reshock. Depending on the rms slope of the initial interface, {\$}\eta{\$}o, there are two different instabilities: one with the classical RMI trends and another with trends suggesting a very different fluid physics which we study in detail. We use statistical metrics to demonstrate that the two different regimes are characterized by very different and self-consistent fluid physics. The response of the rate of mixing layer growth to increasing {\$}\eta{\$}o is different and opposite in sign in each regime: in the high-{\$}\eta{\$}o class of initial conditions, increasing {\$}\eta{\$}o leads to a decrease in kinetic energy and mixing layer growth rate; and in the low-{\$}\eta{\$}o class of flows, increasing {\$}\eta{\$}o leads to an increase in kinetic energy and growth rate. The low {\$}\eta{\$}o case corresponds to impulsive acceleration of an almost-flat thin interface, the classical small-perturbation RMI. The high-{\$}\eta{\$}o regime corresponds to: (a) impulsive acceleration of a very rough initial interface, and (b) shock passage through a turbulent material interface. We additionally observe that this bipolar behavior of the turbulent field is not seen in the statistics of the material mixing field and this may invalidate closures that slave the mixing field to the turbulence. It appears that simple Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes moment closure models cannot currently predict both classes of RMI. We offer speculations on the similarity of instabilities and the possibility of using high-{\$}\eta{\$}o first-shocked simulations to study reshock problems. Our article describes these two instabilities as a function of {\$}\eta{\$}o for fixed A and Ma; we do not propose that {\$}\eta{\$}o offers a complete parameterization of the general problem. {\textcopyright}2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {We discuss a pure hyperbolic alternative to the Navier–Stokes equations, which are of parabolic type. As a result of the substitution of the concept of the viscosity coefficient by a microphysics-based temporal characteristic, particle settled life (PSL) time, it becomes possible to formulate a model for viscous fluids in a form of first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations. Moreover, the concept of PSL time allows the use of the same model for flows of viscous fluids (Newtonian or non-Newtonian) as well as irreversible deformation of solids. In the theory presented, a continuum is interpreted as a system of material particles connected by bonds; the internal resistance to flow is interpreted as elastic stretching of the particle bonds; and a flow is a result of bond destructions and rearrangements of particles. Finally, we examine the model for simple shear flows, arbitrary incompressible and compressible flows of Newtonian fluids and demonstrate that Newton's viscous law can be obtained in the framework of the developed hyperbolic theory as a steady-state limit. A basic relation between the viscosity coefficient, PSL time, and the shear sound velocity is also obtained.},

abstract = {A quasi-conservative formulation for compressible flows with interfaces including both capillary and viscous effects is developed. The model involves: (i) acoustic and convective transport; (ii) surface tension effects introduced as an extension of the CSF method (Brackbill et al.) to compressible flows; (iii) viscous effects. The interfaces are considered as diffused zones. Every point of the flow is correctly described thanks to a mixture equation of state based on energy conservation and pressure equilibrium. The model is thus valid in each pure fluid as well as at interfaces. A Godunov type method, that enables interface capturing, is developed and used whatever the mesh point. Numerical tests are performed over a wide range of physical situations involving surface tension, compressibility, gravity, viscosity and large density ratios. Tests involving break-up and coalescence are considered to show the ability of the method to deal with dynamic appearance and disappearance of interfaces in an Eulerian framework. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A 1152 × 760 × 1280 direct numerical simulation (DNS) using initial conditions, geometry, and physical parameters chosen to approximate those of a transitional, small Atwood number Rayleigh-Taylor mixing experiment [Mueschke, J. Fluid Mech. 567, 27 (2006)] is presented. In particular, the Atwood number is 7.5 × 10-4, and temperature diffusion is modeled by mass diffusion with an equivalent Schmidt number of 7. The density and velocity fluctuations measured just off of the splitter plate in this buoyantly unstable water channel experiment were parametrized to provide physically realistic, anisotropic initial conditions for the DNS. The methodology for parametrizing the measured data and numerically implementing the resulting perturbation spectra in the simulation is discussed in detail. The DNS is then validated by comparing quantities from the simulation to experimental measurements. In particular, large-scale quantities (such as the bubble front penetration hb and the mixing layer growth parameter $\alpha$b), higher-order statistics (such as velocity variances and the molecular mixing parameter $\theta$ on the center plane), and vertical velocity and density variance spectra from the DNS are shown to be in favorable agreement with the experimental data. The DNS slightly underestimates the growth of the bubble front hb but predicts $\alpha$b≈0.07 at the latest time, in excellent agreement with the experimental measurement. While the molecular mixing parameter $\theta$ is also slightly underestimated by the DNS during the nonlinear and weakly turbulent growth phases, the late-time value $\theta$≈0.55 compares favorably with the value $\theta$≈0.6 measured in the experiment. The one-dimensional density and vertical velocity variance spectra are in excellent agreement between the DNS and experimental measurements. Differences between the quantities obtained from the DNS and from experimental measurements are related to limitations in the dynamic range of scales resolved in the DNS and other idealizations of the simulation. Specifically, the statistical convergence of the DNS results and confidence interval bounds are discussed. This work demonstrates that a parametrization of experimentally measured initial conditions can yield simulation data that quantitatively agrees well with experimentally measured low- and higher-order statistics in a Rayleigh-Taylor mixing layer. This study also provides resolution and initial conditions implementation requirements needed to simulate a physical Rayleigh-Taylor mixing experiment. In Paper II [Mueschke and Schilling, Phys. Fluids 21, 014107 (2009)], other quantities not measured in the experiment are obtained from the DNS and discussed, such as the integral- and Taylor-scale Reynolds numbers, Reynolds stress and dissipation anisotropy, two-dimensional density and velocity variance spectra, hypothetical chemical product formation measures, other local and global mixing parameters, and the statistical composition of mixed fluid. These quantities are valuable for assessing the predictions of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and large-eddy simulation models of Rayleigh-Taylor turbulent mixing. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The evolution of high-speed initially laminar multicomponent flows into a turbulent multi-material mixing entity, e.g., in the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability, poses significant challenges for high-fidelity numerical simulations. Although high-order shock- and interface-capturing schemes represent such flows well at early times, the excessive numerical dissipation thereby introduced and the resulting computational cost prevent the resolution of small-scale features. Furthermore, unless special care is taken, shock-capturing schemes generate spurious pressure oscillations at material interfaces where the specific heats ratio varies. To remedy these problems, a solution-adaptive high-order central/shock-capturing finite difference scheme is presented for efficient computations of compressible multi-material flows, including turbulence. A new discontinuity sensor discriminates between smooth and discontinuous regions. The appropriate split form of (energy preserving) central schemes is derived for flows of smoothly varying specific heats ratio, such that spurious pressure oscillations are prevented. High-order accurate weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes are applied only at discontinuities; the standard approach is followed for shocks and contacts, but material discontinuities are treated by interpolating the primitive variables. The hybrid nature of the method allows for efficient and accurate computations of shocks and broadband motions, and is shown to prevent pressure oscillations for varying specific heats ratios. The method is assessed through one-dimensional problems with shocks, sharp interfaces and smooth distributions of specific heats ratio, and the two-dimensional single-mode inviscid and viscous Richtmyer-Meshkov instability with re-shock. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) are applied to the analysis of a swirl burner operated with a lean methane-air mixture and experimentally studied by Meier et al. [. 19]. LES is performed for various mesh refinements, to study unsteady and coherent large-scale behavior and to validate the simulation tool from measurements, while DNS enables to gain insight into the flame structure and dynamics. The DNS features a 2.6 billion cells unstructured-mesh and a resolution of less than 100 microns, which is sufficient to capture all the turbulent scales and the major species of the flame brush; the unresolved species are taken into account thanks to a tabulated chemistry approach. In a second part of the paper, the DNS is filtered at several filter widths to estimate the prediction capabilities of modeling based on premixed flamelet and presumed probability density functions. The similarities and differences between spatially-filtered laminar and turbulent flames are discussed and a new sub-grid scale closure for premixed turbulent combustion is proposed, which preserves spectral properties of sub-filter flame length scales. All these simulations are performed with a solver specifically tailored for large-scale computations on massively parallel machines. ?? 2010 The Combustion Institute.},

abstract = {We review the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent flows. We stress that DNS is a research tool, and not a brute-force solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for engineering problems. The wide range of scales in turbulent flows requires that care be taken in their numerical solution. We discuss related numerical issues such as boundary conditions and spatial and temporal discretization. Significant insight into turbulence physics has been gained from DNS of certain idealized flows that cannot be easily attained in the laboratory. We discuss some examples. Further, we illustrate the complementary nature of experiments and computations in turbulence research. Examples are provided where DNS data has been used to evaluate measurement accuracy. Finally, we consider how DNS has impacted turbulence modeling and provided further insight into the structure of turbulent boundary layers.},

abstract = {Two Lagrangian-Eulerian vortex methods to simulate the motion of an interface between inviscid fluids of different densities are presented. The representation of the interface as a vortex sheet eliminates numerical diffusion, and by coupling the tracked interface with a stationary grid (using the well-known vortex-in-cell method) the high cost associated with traditional vortex methods is reduced. These methods are applied to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. For finite density ratios the appearance of rolled up vortices and a possible singularity formation has limited simulations in the past. By providing proper regularization our methods overcome some of these difficulties. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

@article{Livescu2010,
abstract = {This paper presents several issues related to mixing and turbulence structure in buoyancy-driven turbulence at low to moderate Atwood numbers, A, found from direct numerical simulations in two configurations: classical Rayleigh-Taylor instability and an idealized triply periodic Rayleigh-Taylor flow. Simulations at A up to 0.5 are used to examine the turbulence characteristics and contrast them with those obtained close to the Boussinesq approximation. The data sets used represent the largest simulations to date in each configuration. One of the more remarkable issues explored, first reported in (Livescu and Ristorcelli 2008 J. Fluid Mech. 605 145-80), is the marked difference in mixing between different density fluids as opposed to the mixing that occurs between fluids of commensurate densities, corresponding to the Boussinesq approximation. Thus, in the triply periodic configuration and the non-Boussinesq case, an initially symmetric density probability density function becomes skewed, showing that the mixing is asymmetric, with pure heavy fluid mixing more slowly than pure light fluid. A mechanism producing the mixing asymmetry is proposed and the consequences for the classical Rayleigh-Taylor configuration are discussed. In addition, it is shown that anomalous small-scale anisotropy found in the homogeneous configuration (Livescu and Ristorcelli 2008 J. Fluid Mech. 605 145-80) and Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence at A=0.5 (Livescu et al 2008 J. Turbul. 10 1-32) also occurs near the Boussinesq limit. Results pertaining to the moment closure modelling of Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence are also presented. Although the Rayleigh-Taylor mixing layer width reaches self-similar growth relatively fast, the lower-order terms in the self-similar expressions for turbulence moments have long-lasting effects and derived quantities, such as the turbulent Reynolds number, are slow to follow the self-similar predictions. Since eddy diffusivity in the popular gradient transport hypothesis is proportional to the turbulent Reynolds number, the dissipation rate and turbulent transport have different length scales long after the onset of the self-similar growth for the layer growth. To highlight the importance of turbulent transport, variable density energy budgets for the kinetic energy, mass flux and density-specific volume covariance equations, necessary for a moment closure of the flow, are provided. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {Buoyancy-generated motions in an unstably stratified medium composed of two incompressible miscible fluids with different densities, as occurs in the variable-density Rayleigh-Taylor instability, are examined using direct numerical simulations. The non-equilibrium homogeneous buoyantly driven problem is proposed as a unit problem for variable density turbulence to study: (i) the nature of variable density turbulence, (ii) the transition to turbulence and the generation of turbulence by the conversion of potential to kinetic energy; (iii) the role of non-Boussinesq effects; and (iv) a parameterization of the initial conditions by a static Reynolds number. Simulations are performed for Atwood numbers up to 0.5 with root mean square density up to 50{\%} of the mean density and Schmidt numbers, 0.1 ? Sc ? 2. The benchmark problem has been designed to have the largest mass flux possible and is, in this configuration, the maximally unstable non-equilibrium flow possible. It is found that the mass flux, owing to its central role in the conversion of potential to kinetic energy, is probably the single most important dynamical quantity to predict in lower-dimensional models. Other primary findings include the evolution of the mean pressure gradient: during the non-Boussinesq portions of the flow, the evolution of the mean pressure gradient is non-hydrostatic (as opposed to a Boussinesq fluid) and is set by the evolution of the specific volume pressure gradient correlation. To obtain the numerical solution, a new pressure projection algorithm which treats the pressure step exactly, useful for simulations of non-solenoidal velocity flows, has been constructed. ? 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The reshocked single-mode Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is simulated in two spatial dimensions using the fifth- and ninth-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory shock-capturing method with uniform spatial resolution of 256 points per initial perturbation wavelength. The initial conditions and computational domain are modeled after the single-mode, Mach 1.21 air(acetone)/SF6 shock tube experiment of Collins and Jacobs J. Fluid Mech. 464, 113 (2002). The simulation densities are shown to be in very good agreement with the corrected experimental planar laser-induced fluorescence images at selected times before reshock of the evolving interface. Analytical, semianalytical, and phenomenological linear and nonlinear, impulsive, perturbation, and potential flow models for single-mode Richtmyer-Meshkov unstable perturbation growth are summarized. The simulation amplitudes are shown to be in very good agreement with the experimental data and with the predictions of linear amplitude growth models for small times, and with those of nonlinear amplitude growth models at later times up to the time at which the driver-based expansion in the experiment (but not present in the simulations or models) expands the layer before reshock. The qualitative and quantitative differences between the fifth- and ninth-order simulation results are discussed. Using a local and global quantitative metric, the prediction of the Zhang and Sohn Phys. Fluids 9, 1106 (1997) nonlinear Pad{\&}eacute; model is shown to be in best overall agreement with the simulation amplitudes before reshock. The sensitivity of the amplitude growth model predictions to the initial growth rate from linear instability theory, the post-shock Atwood number and amplitude, and the velocity jump due to the passage of the shock through the interface is also investigated numerically.},

abstract = {Flows in which shock waves and turbulence are present and interact dynamically occur in a wide range of applications, including inertial confinement fusion, supernovae explosion, and scramjet propulsion. Accurate simulations of such problems are challenging because of the contradictory requirements of numerical methods used to simulate turbulence, which must minimize any numerical dissipation that would otherwise overwhelm the small scales, and shock-capturing schemes, which introduce numerical dissipation to stabilize the solution. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the performance of several numerical methods capable of simultaneously handling turbulence and shock waves. A comprehensive range of high-resolution methods (WENO, hybrid WENO/central difference, artificial diffusivity, adaptive characteristic-based filter, and shock fitting) and suite of test cases (Taylor-Green vortex, Shu-Osher problem, shock-vorticity/entropy wave interaction, Noh problem, compressible isotropic turbulence) relevant to problems with shocks and turbulence are considered. The results indicate that the WENO methods provide sharp shock profiles, but overwhelm the physical dissipation. The hybrid method is minimally dissipative and leads to sharp shocks and well-resolved broadband turbulence, but relies on an appropriate shock sensor. Artificial diffusivity methods in which the artificial bulk viscosity is based on the magnitude of the strain-rate tensor resolve vortical structures well but damp dilatational modes in compressible turbulence; dilatation-based artificial bulk viscosity methods significantly improve this behavior. For well-defined shocks, the shock fitting approach yields good results. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In the present work, errors generated in computations of compressible multi-material flows using shock-capturing schemes are examined, specifically pressure oscillations (when the specific heats ratio is variable), but also temperature spikes and species conservation errors. These numerical errors are generated at material discontinuities due to an inconsistent treatment of the convective terms. Though temperature errors are irrelevant to solutions to the Euler equations, it is shown that they have the potential to lead to problems when physical diffusion is included, . i.e., for the Navier-Stokes equations. These errors are studied analytically and numerically by considering the one-dimensional advection of isolated material discontinuities. A methodology preventing such errors for weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes is presented, in which modified WENO weights are used to solve the transport equation for mass fraction in conservative form to prevent temperature and species conservation errors. Pressure errors are prevented by solving an additional transport equation for a given function of the ratio of specific heats. Several multi-dimensional problems with various discontinuities (shocks, material interfaces and contact discontinuities), including the single-mode Richtmyer-Meshkov instability, and turbulence are considered to test the method. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

These modifications produce a very detailed look at the evolution of the late-time single-mode instability, revealing the transition and development of turbulence in the vortex cores that eventually results in the disintegration of the laminar vortex structures into small scale features. Amplitude measurements taken from these images are shown to be effectively collapsed when plotted in dimensionless variables defined using the wave number and the initial growth rate. The amplitude measurements are compared with several late-time nonlinear models and solutions. The best agreement is obtained with the model of Sadot et al. ͓Phys. Rev.

Computed example problems of shock wave and droplet interactions compare well with empirical measurements and show counterintuitive vaporization trends that are explainable from basic physical arguments.

@inproceedings{Groom2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Combustion Institute. All Rights Reserved. When simulating compressible multispecies flows using interface-capturing finite-volume methods, the typical approach of using transport equations for species mass fractions can produce errors in pressure and/or temperature across material interfaces under certain circumstances. Adding quasi-conservative transport equations for species volume fractions, such as the five-equation model of Allaire et al. [J. Comput. Phys. 181 (2002) 577-616], has been shown to remove these errors in inviscid flows and here we extend that approach to include the effects of species diffusion as well as viscosity and thermal conductivity. A second order accurate finite-volume method is derived to solve the new set of equations and formal convergence studies are presented to demonstrate the benefits with respect to the typical four-equation approach based on mass fractions.},

abstract = {In the large eddy simulation (LES) approach, large-scale energy-containing structures are resolved, smaller structures are filtered out, and unresolved subgrid effects are modeled. Extensive recent work has demonstrated that predictive under-resolved simulations of the velocity fields in turbulent flows are possible without resorting to explicit subgrid models when using a class of physics-capturing high-resolution finite-volume numerical algorithms. This strategy is denoted as implicit LES (ILES). Tests in fundamental applications ranging from canonical to complex flows indicate that ILES is competitive with conventional LES in the LES realm proper-flows driven by large-scale features. The performance of ILES in the substantially more difficult problem of under-resolved material mixing driven by under-resolved velocity fields and initial conditions is a focus of the present work. Progress in addressing relevant resolution issues in studies of mixing driven by Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities in planar shock-tube laboratory experiments is reported. Our particular focus is devoted to the initial material interface characterization and modeling difficulties, and effects of initial condition specifics (resolved spectral content) on transitional and late-time turbulent mixing-which were not previously addressed.

abstract = {Recent developments in numerical schemes, turbulent combustion models and the regular increase of computing power allow Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to be applied to real industrial burners. In this paper, two types of LES in complex geometry combustors and of specific interest for aeronautical gas turbine burners are reviewed: (1) laboratory-scale combustors, without compressor or turbine, in which advanced measurements are possible and (2) combustion chambers of existing engines operated in realistic operating conditions. Laboratory-scale burners are designed to assess modeling and fundamental flow aspects in controlled configurations. They are necessary to gauge LES strategies and identify potential limitations. In specific circumstances, they even offer near model-free or DNS-like LES computations. LES in real engines illustrate the potential of the approach in the context of industrial burners but are more difficult to validate due to the limited set of available measurements. Usual approaches for turbulence and combustion sub-grid models including chemistry modeling are first recalled. Limiting cases and range of validity of the models are specifically recalled before a discussion on the numerical breakthrough which have allowed LES to be applied to these complex cases. Specific issues linked to real gas turbine chambers are discussed: multi-perforation, complex acoustic impedances at inlet and outlet, annular chambers.... Examples are provided for mean flow predictions (velocity, temperature and species) as well as unsteady mechanisms (quenching, ignition, combustion instabilities). Finally, potential perspectives are proposed to further improve the use of LES for real gas turbine combustor designs. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = { Rayleigh–Taylor instability induced turbulence between two compressible miscible Newtonian fluids is studied in a strongly stratified configuration at a moderate Atwood number. A direct numerical simulation has been carried out with an auto-adaptive multidomain Chebyshev–Fourier–Fourier numerical method. The spatial resolution is increased up to {\$}(9\backslashtimes 100)\backslashtimes 1000{\^{}}2=900M{\$} collocation points. These numerical data are compared with those obtained from a simulation carried out at a lower Reynolds number and at the same Atwood number, and those obtained from a simulation carried out within the Boussinesq approximation at the same Reynolds number. A comprehensive data analysis is reported. Physical-variable mean profiles – density, concentration, temperature, entropy, velocity, vorticity, helicity and palinstrophy – are provided. Anisotropy is studied in the spectral space. The intermediate-scale isotropy and the small-scale anisotropy are exhibited for the scalars, i.e. concentration and temperature. Velocity is anisotropic at all scales but this anisotropy is more marked at small scales. The data are also analysed with the Favre-averaged equations. Sources of the turbulent kinetic energy, mass flux, root-mean-square density and energy equations are analysed. Compressibility effects are discussed in particular with the Kov{\`{a}}sznay-mode decomposition. A statistical study is reported where skewnesses, flatnesses and probability density functions (PDFs) are displayed and commented. A flow visualization is also given. Finally, the temperature field appears to be the slave of the mixing. This conclusion is drawn from the comparison of power spectra, anisotropy spectra, skewnesses, flatnesses, PDFs and correlation coefficients. There is however a significant time lag between the density and temperature evolution. },

abstract = {While Eulerian schemes work well for most gas flows, they have been shown to admit nonphysical oscillations near some material interfaces. In contrast, Lagrangian schemes work well at multimaterial interfaces, but suffer from their own difficulties in problems with large deformations and vorticity characteristic of most gas flows. We believe that the most robust schemes will combine the best properties of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes. In this paper, we propose a new numerical method for treating interfaces in Eulerian schemes that maintains a Heaviside profile of the density with no numerical smearing along the lines of earlier work and most Lagrangian schemes. We use a level set function to track the motion of a multimaterial interface in an Eulerian framework. In addition, the use of ghost cells (actually ghost nodes in our finite difference framework) and a new isobaric fix technique allows us to keep the density profile from smearing out, while still keeping the scheme robust and easy to program with simple extensions to multidimensions and multilevel time integration, e.g., Runge–Kutta methods. In contrast, previous methods used ill-advised dimensional splitting for multidimensional problems and suffered from great complexity when used in conjunction with multilevel time integrators.},

@article{Edwards2013a,
abstract = {The National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory includes a precision laser system now capable of delivering 1.8 MJ at 500 TW of 0.35-$\mu$m light to a target. NIF has been operational since March 2009. A variety of experiments have been completed in support of NIF{\&}apos;s mission areas: national security, fundamental science, and inertial fusion energy. NIF capabilities and infrastructure are in place to support its missions with nearly 60 X-ray, optical, and nuclear diagnostic systems. A primary goal of the National Ignition Campaign (NIC) on the NIF was to implode a low-Z capsule filled with ∼0.2 mg of deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel via laser indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion and demonstrate fusion ignition and propagating thermonuclear burn with a net energy gain of ∼5–10 (fusion yield/input laser energy). This requires assembling the DT fuel into a dense shell of ∼1000 g/cm3 with an areal density ($\rho$R) of ∼1.5 g/cm2, surrounding a lower density hot spot with a temperature of ∼10 keV and a $\rho$R ∼0.3 g/cm2, or approximately an $\alpha$-particle range. Achieving these conditions demand precise control of laser and target parameters to allow a low adiabat, high convergence implosion with low ablator fuel mix. We have demonstrated implosion and compressed fuel conditions at ∼80–90{\%} for most point design values independently, but not at the same time. The nuclear yield is a factor of ∼3–10× below the simulated values and a similar factor below the alpha dominated regime. This paper will discuss the experimental trends, the possible causes of the degraded performance (the off-set from the simulations), and the plan to understand and resolve the underlying physics issues.},

The model is able to describe the behavior of moving elasto-plastic dielectric solids as well as viscous and inviscid fluids in the presence of electro-magnetic fields. It is actually a very peculiar feature of the proposed PDE system that viscous fluids are treated just as a special case of elasto-plastic solids. This is achieved by introducing a strain relaxation mechanism in the evolution equations of the distortion matrix A, which in the case of purely elastic solids maps the current configuration to the reference configuration. The model also contains a hyperbolic formulation of heat conduction as well as a dissipative source term in the evolution equations for the electric field given by Ohm's law. Via formal asymptotic analysis we show that in the stiff limit, the governing first order hyperbolic PDE system with relaxation source terms tends asymptotically to the well-known viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. Furthermore, a rigorous derivation of the model from variational principles is presented, together with the transformation of the Euler–Lagrange differential equations associated with the underlying variational problem from Lagrangian coordinates to Eulerian coordinates in a fixed laboratory frame. The present paper hence extends the unified first order hyperbolic model of Newtonian continuum mechanics recently proposed in [110,42] to the more general case where the continuum is coupled with electro-magnetic fields. The governing PDE system is symmetric hyperbolic and satisfies the first and second principle of thermodynamics, hence it belongs to the so-called class of symmetric hyperbolic thermodynamically compatible systems (SHTC), which have been studied for the first time by Godunov in 1961 [61] and later in a series of papers by Godunov and Romenski [67,69,119]. An important feature of the proposed model is that the propagation speeds of all physical processes, including dissipative processes, are finite. The model is discretized using high order accurate ADER discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes with a posteriori subcell finite volume limiter and using high order ADER-WENO finite volume schemes. We show numerical test problems that explore a rather large parameter space of the model ranging from ideal MHD, viscous and resistive MHD over pure electro-dynamics to moving dielectric elastic solids in a magnetic field.},

@article{Dumbser2008a,
abstract = {In this article, we propose a new class of finite volume schemes of arbitrary accuracy in space and time for systems of hyperbolic balance laws with stiff source terms. The new class of schemes is based on a three stage procedure. First a high-order WENO reconstruction procedure is applied to the cell averages at the current time level. Second, the temporal evolution of the reconstruction polynomials is computed locally inside each cell using the governing equations. In the original ENO scheme of Harten et al. and in the ADER schemes of Titarev and Toro, this time evolution is achieved via a Taylor series expansion where the time derivatives are computed by repeated differentiation of the governing PDE with respect to space and time, i.e. by applying the so-called Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure. However, this approach is not able to handle stiff source terms. Therefore, we present a new strategy that only replaces the Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure compared to the previously mentioned schemes. For the time-evolution part of the algorithm, we introduce a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element scheme that is able to handle also stiff source terms. This step is the only part of the algorithm which is locally implicit. The third and last step of the proposed ADER finite volume schemes consists of the standard explicit space-time integration over each control volume, using the local space-time DG solutions at the Gaussian integration points for the intercell fluxes and for the space-time integral over the source term. We will show numerical convergence studies for nonlinear systems in one space dimension with both non-stiff and with very stiff source terms up to sixth order of accuracy in space and time. The application of the new method to a large set of different test cases is shown, in particular the stiff scalar model problem of LeVeque and Yee [R.J. LeVeque, H.C. Yee, A study of numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws with stiff source terms, Journal of Computational Physics 86 (1) (1990) 187-210], the relaxation system of Jin and Xin [S. Jin, Z.

@article{Dumbser2008,
abstract = {In this article, a conservative least-squares polynomial reconstruction operator is applied to the discontinuous Galerkin method. In a first instance, piecewise polynomials of degree N are used as test functions as well as to represent the data in each element at the beginning of a time step. The time evolution of these data and the flux computation, however, are then done with a different set of piecewise polynomials of degree M ≥ N, which are reconstructed from the underlying polynomials of degree N. This approach yields a general, unified framework that contains as two special cases classical high order finite volume (FV) schemes (N = 0) as well as the usual discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method (N = M). In the first case, the polynomial is reconstructed from cell averages, for the latter, the reconstruction reduces to the identity operator. A completely new class of numerical schemes is generated by choosing N ≠ 0 and M {\textgreater}N. The reconstruction operator is implemented for arbitrary polynomial degrees N and M on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes in two and three space dimensions. To provide a high order accurate one-step time integration of the same formal order of accuracy as the spatial discretization operator, the (reconstructed) polynomial data of degree M are evolved in time locally inside each element using a new local continuous space-time Galerkin method. As a result of this approach, we obtain, as a high order accurate predictor, space-time polynomials for the vector of conserved variables and for the physical fluxes and source terms, which then can be used in a natural way to construct very efficient fully-discrete and quadrature-free one-step schemes. This feature is particularly important for DG schemes in three space dimensions, where the cost of numerical quadrature may become prohibitively expensive for very high orders of accuracy. Numerical convergence studies of all members of the new general class of proposed schemes are shown up to sixth-order of accuracy in space and time on unstructured two- and three-dimensional meshes for two very prominent nonlinear hyperbolic systems, namely for the Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The results indicate that the new class of intermediate schemes (N ≠ 0, M {\textgreater}N) is computationally more efficient than classical finite volume or DG schemes. Finally, a large set of interesting test cases is solved on unstructured meshes, where the proposed new time stepping approach is applied to the equations of ideal and relativistic MHD as well as to nonlinear elasticity, using a standard high order WENO finite volume discretization in space to cope with discontinuous solutions. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We develop a shock- and interface-capturing numerical method that is suitable for the simulation of multicomponent flows governed by the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The numerical method is high-order accurate in smooth regions of the flow, discretely conserves the mass of each component, as well as the total momentum and energy, and is oscillation-free, i.e. it does not introduce spurious oscillations at the locations of shockwaves and/or material interfaces. The method is of Godunov-type and utilizes a fifth-order, finite-volume, weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme for the spatial reconstruction and a Harten-Lax-van Leer contact (HLLC) approximate Riemann solver to upwind the fluxes. A third-order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta (RK) algorithm is employed to march the solution in time. The derivation is generalized to three dimensions and nonuniform Cartesian grids. A two-point, fourth-order, Gaussian quadrature rule is utilized to build the spatial averages of the reconstructed variables inside the cells, as well as at cell boundaries. The algorithm is therefore fourth-order accurate in space and third-order accurate in time in smooth regions of the flow. We corroborate the properties of our numerical method by considering several challenging one-, two- and three-dimensional test cases, the most complex of which is the asymmetric collapse of an air bubble submerged in a cylindrical water cavity that is embedded in 10{\%} gelatin. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The enthalpy diffusion flux in the multicomponent energy equation is a well-known yet frequently neglected term. It accounts for energy changes associated with compositional changes resulting from species diffusion. The term prevents local violations of the entropy condition in flows where significant mixing occurs between species of dissimilar molecular weight. In simulations of nonpremixed combustion, omission of the enthalpy flux can lead to anomalous temperature gradients, which may cause mixing regions to exceed ignition conditions. The term can also play a role in generating acoustic noise in turbulent mixing layers. Euler solvers that rely on numerical diffusion to blend fluids at the grid scale cannot reliably predict temperatures in mixing regions. On the other hand, Navier–Stokes solvers that incorporate enthalpy diffusion can provide much more accurate results. In constructing turbulence closures for high Reynolds number mixing, the same turbulent diffusion model that appears in the species mass transport equation should also appear in the energy equation as part of a ” turbulent enthalpy diffusion;” otherwise the energy and species transport equations will not be consistent.},

They combine a special class of Runge–Kutta time discretizations, that allows the method to be non-linearly stable regardless of its accuracy, with a finite element space discretization by discontinuous approximations, that incorporates the ideas of numerical fluxes and slope limiters coined during the remarkable development of the high-resolution finite difference and finite volume schemes. The resulting RKDG methods are stable, high-order accurate, and highly parallelizable schemes that can easily handle complicated geometries and boundary conditions.

We use an adaptation of the fringe-region technique,$\backslash$nwhich continually supplies the flow with unmixed fluids at two opposite$\backslash$nfaces of a triply periodic domain in the presence of gravity, effectively$\backslash$nmaintaining an unstably stratified, but statistically stationary$\backslash$nflow. We also develop a new method to solve the governing equations,$\backslash$nbased on the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, that guarantees discrete$\backslash$nmass conservation regardless of iteration errors. Whilst some statistics$\backslash$nwere found to be sensitive to the computational box size, we show,$\backslash$nfrom inner-scaled planar spectra, that the small scales exhibit similarity$\backslash$nindependent of Reynolds number, density ratio and aspect ratio. We$\backslash$nalso perform LES of the present flow using the stretched-vortex subgrid-scale$\backslash$n(SGS) model. The utility of an SGS scalar flux closure for passive$\backslash$nscalars is demonstrated in the present active-scalar, stably stratified$\backslash$nflow setting. The multi-scale character of the stretched-vortex SGS$\backslash$nmodel is shown to enable extension of some second-order statistics$\backslash$nto subgrid scales. Comparisons with DNS velocity spectra and velocity-density$\backslash$ncospectra show that both the resolved-scale and SGS-extended components$\backslash$nof the LES spectra accurately capture important features of the DNS$\backslash$nspectra, including small-scale anisotropy and the shape of the viscous$\backslash$nroll-off.},

abstract = {The Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability develops and leads to turbulence when a heavy fluid falls under the action of gravity through a light one. We consider a model in which the RT instability is accompanied by a reactive transformation between the fluids. We study the model using direct numerical simulations (DNSs), focusing on the effect of the reaction (flame) on the turbulent mixing. We discuss 'slow' reactions in which the characteristic reaction time exceeds the temporal scale of the RT instability, $\tau$ ≫ tinst. In the early turbulent stage, tinst ≲ t ≲ $\tau$, effects of the flame are distributed over a maturing mixing zone, whose development is weakly influenced by the reaction. At t ≳ $\tau$, the fully mixed zone transforms into a conglomerate of pure-fluid patches of sizes proportional to the mixing zone width. In this 'stirred flame' regime, temperature fluctuations are consumed by reactions in the regions separating the pure-fluid patches. This DNS-based qualitative description is followed by a phenomenology suggesting that thin turbulent flame is of a single-fractal character, and thus distribution of the temperature field is strongly intermittent. $\backslash$copyright 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {We computationally investigate the Richtmyer–Meshkov instability of a density interface with a single-mode perturbation in a two-fluid, ion–electron plasma with no initial magnetic field. Self-generated magnetic fields arise subsequently. We study the case where the density jump across the initial interface is due to a thermal discontinuity, and select plasma parameters for which two-fluid plasma effects are expected to be significant in order to elucidate how they alter the instability. The instability is driven via a Riemann problem generated precursor electron shock that impacts the density interface ahead of the ion shock. The resultant charge separation and motion generates electromagnetic fields that cause the electron shock to degenerate and periodically accelerate the electron and ion interfaces, driving Rayleigh–Taylor instability. This generates small-scale structures and substantially increases interfacial growth over the hydrodynamic case.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Copyright 2017 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved. Basic fluid equations are the main ingredient in the development of theories of Rayleigh-Taylor buoyancy-induced instability. Turbulence arises in the late stage of the instability evolution as a result of the proliferation of active scales of motion. Fluctuations are maintained by the unceasing conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy. Although the dynamics of turbulent fluctuations is ruled by the same equations controlling the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, here only phenomenological theories are currently available. The present review provides an overview of the most relevant (and often contrasting) theoretical approaches to Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence together with numerical and experimental evidence for their support. Although the focus is mainly on the classical Boussinesq Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence of miscible fluids, the review extends to other fluid systems with viscoelastic behavior, affected by rotation of the reference frame, and, finally, in the presence of reactions.},

RT turbulence is a paradigmatic time-dependent turbulent system in which the integral scale grows in time following the evolution of the mixing region. In order to fully characterize the statistical properties of the flowboth temporal and spatial behaviors of relevant statistical indicators have been analyzed. Scaling of both global quantities (e.g.RayleighNusselt Reynolds numbers) and scale dependent observables built in terms of velocity and temperature fluctuations are considered. We extend the mean-field analysis for velocity and temperature fluctuations to take into account intermittencyboth in time and space domains. We show that the resulting scaling exponents are compatible with that of the classical Navier-Stokes turbulence advecting a passive scalar at comparable Reynolds number. Our results support the scenario of universality of turbulence with respect to both the injection mechanism and the geometry of the flow. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

We discuss quantitatively the requirements needed to keep the method stable and precise enough to simulate stratified and unstratified flows driven by thermal active fluctuations at high Rayleigh and high Reynolds numbers. We present data with spatial resolution up to 4096 x 10000 grid points and Rayleigh number up to Ra {\~{}} 10{\^{}}11 . The statistical quality of the data allows us to investigate velocity and temperature fluctuations, scale-by-scale, over roughly four decades. We present a detailed quantitative analysis of scaling laws in the viscous, inertial and integral range, supporting the existence of a Bolgiano-like inertial scaling, as expected in 2d systems. We also discuss the presence of small/large intermittent deviation to the scaling of velocity/temperature fluctuations and the Rayleigh dependency of gradients flatness.},

abstract = {Two new techniques for the study of the linear and nonlinear instability in growing boundary layers are presented. The first technique employs partial differential equations of parabolic type exploiting the slow change of the mean flow, disturbance velocity profiles, wavelengths, and growth rates in the streamwise direction. The second technique solves the Navier-Stokes equation for spatially evolving disturbances using buffer zones adjacent to the inflow and outflow boundaries. Results of both techniques are in excellent agreement. The linear and nonlinear development of Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves in the Blasius boundary layer is investigated with both techniques and with a local procedure based on a system of ordinary differential equations. The results are compared with previous work and the effects of non-parallelism and nonlinearity are clarified. The effect of nonparallelism is confirmed to be weak and, consequently, not responsible for the discrepancies between measurements and theoretical results for parallel flow.},

abstract = {The present paper introduces a class of finite volume schemes of increasing order of accuracy in space and time for hyperbolic systems that are in conservation form. The methods are specially suited for efficient implementation on structured meshes. The hyperbolic system is required to be non-stiff. This paper specifically focuses on Euler system that is used for modeling the flow of neutral fluids and the divergence-free, ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system that is used for large scale modeling of ionized plasmas. Efficient techniques for weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) interpolation have been developed for finite volume reconstruction on structured meshes. We have shown that the most elegant and compact formulation of WENO reconstruction obtains when the interpolating functions are expressed in modal space. Explicit formulae have been provided for schemes having up to fourth order of spatial accuracy. Divergence-free evolution of magnetic fields requires the magnetic field components and their moments to be defined in the zone faces. We draw on a reconstruction strategy developed recently by the first author to show that a high order specification of the magnetic field components in zone-faces naturally furnishes an appropriately high order representation of the magnetic field within the zone. We also present a new formulation of the ADER (for Arbitrary Derivative Riemann Problem) schemes that relies on a local continuous space-time Galerkin formulation instead of the usual Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure. We call such schemes ADER-CG and show that a very elegant and compact formulation results when the scheme is formulated in modal space. Explicit formulae have been provided on structured meshes for ADER-CG schemes in three dimensions for all orders of accuracy that extend up to fourth order. Such ADER schemes have been used to temporally evolve the WENO-based spatial reconstruction. The resulting ADER-WENO schemes provide temporal accuracy that matches the spatial accuracy of the underlying WENO reconstruction. In this paper we have also provided a point-wise description of ADER-WENO schemes for divergence-free MHD in a fashion that facilitates computer implementation. The schemes reported here have all been implemented in the RIEMANN framework for computational astrophysics. All the methods presented have a one-step update, making them low-storage alternatives to the usual Runge-Kutta time-discretization. Their one-step update also makes them suitable building blocks for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) calculations. We demonstrate that the ADER-WENO meet their design accuracies. Several stringent test problems of Euler flows and MHD flows are presented in one, two and three dimensions. Many of our test problems involve near infinite shocks in multiple dimensions and the higher order schemes are shown to perform very robustly and accurately under all conditions. It is shown that the increasing computational complexity with increasing order is handily offset by the increased accuracy of the scheme. The resulting ADER-WENO schemes are, therefore, very worthy alternatives to the standard second order schemes for compressible Euler and MHD flow. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {ADER (Arbitrary DERivative in space and time) methods for the time-evolution of hyperbolic conservation laws have recently generated a fair bit of interest. The ADER time update can be carried out in a single step, which is desirable in many applications. However, prior papers have focused on the theory while downplaying implementation details. The purpose of the present paper is to make ADER schemes accessible by providing two useful formulations of the method as well as their implementation details on three-dimensional structured meshes. We therefore provide a detailed formulation of ADER schemes for conservation laws with non-stiff source terms in nodal as well as modal space along with useful implementation-related details. A good implementation of ADER requires a fast method for transcribing from nodal to modal space and vice versa and we provide innovative transcription strategies that are computationally efficient. We also provide details for the efficient use of ADER schemes in obtaining the numerical flux for conservation laws as well as electric fields for divergence-free magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). An efficient WENO-based strategy for obtaining zone-averaged magnetic fields from face-centered magnetic fields in MHD is also presented. Several explicit formulae have been provided in all instances for ADER schemes spanning second to fourth orders.The schemes catalogued here have been implemented in the first author's RIEMANN code. The speed of ADER schemes is shown to be almost twice as fast as that of strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta time stepping schemes for all the orders of accuracy that we tested. The modal and nodal ADER schemes have speeds that are within ten percent of each other. When a linearized Riemann solver is used, the third order ADER schemes are half as fast as the second order ADER schemes and the fourth order ADER schemes are a third as fast as the third order ADER schemes. The third order ADER scheme, either with an HLL or linearized Riemann solver, represents an excellent upgrade path for scientists and engineers who are working with a second order Runge-Kutta based total variation diminishing (TVD) scheme. Several stringent test problems have been catalogued.Video 1. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The progress of the LLNL Laser Fusion Program in our work to achieve high gain thermonuclear microex-plosions is discussed. Many experiments have been successfully performed and diagnosed using the large complex twenty-beam 30-TW Shiva laser system. A 400-kJ design of the twenty-beam Nova laser has been completed. The construction of the first phase of this facility has begun. The first phase of this Nd-doped low nonlinear index glass laser will consist of ten beams producing 100 kJ in 1-nsec pulses. One beam of the Argus laser has been converted to operation at 532 nm with 10-cm aperture. It will soon operate at 355 nm, also at 10-cm aperture. Frequency conversion crystals are being procured for full aperture operation at either 532 or 355 nm for both Argus beams. We also discuss new diagnostic instruments which provide us with new and improved resolution, information on laser absorption and scattering, thermal energy flow, supra-thermal electrons and their effects, and final fuel conditions. We have made measurements on the absorption and Brillouin scattering for target irradiations at both 1.064 microm and 532 nm. These measurements confirm the expected increased absorption and reduced scattering at the shorter wavelength. Additional data have been obtained on the angular distribution of suprathermal x rays, which further confirms our observation of its nonisotropy. However, we do not yet have an explanation of the phenomena. Implosion experiments have been performed which have produced final fuel densities over the 10-100x range liquid deuterium-tritium (DT) density. The 100x achievement is the highest yet achieved in laser fusion DT fuel targets.},

abstract = {In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), the possibility of ignition or high energy gain is largely determined by our ability to control the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability growth in the target. The exponentially amplified RT perturbation eigenmodes are formed from all sources of the target and radiation non-uniformity in a process called seeding. This process involves a variety of physical mechanisms that are somewhat similar to the classical Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM) instability (in particular, most of them are active in the absence of acceleration), but differ from it in many ways. In the last decade, radiographic diagnostic techniques have been developed that made direct observations of the RM-type effects in the ICF-relevant conditions possible. New experiments stimulated the advancement of the theory of the RM-type processes. The progress in the experimental and theoretical studies of such phenomena as ablative RM instability, re-shock of the RM-unstable interface, feedout and perturbation development associated with impulsive loading is reviewed.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing interest in developing numerical algorithms for compressible multifluids. Computations ran into unexpected difficulties due to oscillations generated at material interfaces, and understanding of the underlying mechanisms was needed before these oscillations could be circumvented. This paper reviews some of the recent models and numerical algorithms that have been proposed and points to key ideas that they have in common. Noting the known fact that such oscillations do not arise in single-fluid computations, an extremely simple algorithm is proposed which circumvents the oscillations and amounts to computing two different flux functions across material fronts, to update the different fluids on both sides.},

In this paper, we raise some fundamental questions concerning the conceptual foundations of LES and about the methodologies and protocols used in its application. The 10 questions addressed are stated at the end of the introduction. Several of these questions highlight the importance of recognizing the dependence of LES calculations on the artificial parameter delta (i.e. the filter width, or more generally, the turbulence resolution length scale). The principle that LES predictions of turbulence statistics should depend minimally on delta provides an alternative justification for the dynamic procedure.},

We modify Goncharov's local analysis [1] to consider the surface tension effect on the Rayleigh-Taylor bubble velocity. The surface tension damps the linear instability and reduces the nonlinear terminal bubble velocity. We summarize the development of a finite-volume, particle-level-set, two-phase flow solver with an adaptive Cartesian mesh, and results from convergence and validation studies of this two-phase flow solver are provided. We use this code to simulate the single-mode, viscous Rayleigh-Taylor instability with surface tension, and good agreement in terminal bubble velocity is found when compared with analytic results. We also simulate the immiscible Rayleigh-Taylor instability with random initial perturbations. The ensuing mixing flow is characterized by the effective mixing rate and the flow anisotropy. Surface tension tends to reduce the effective mixing rate and homogenizes the Rayleigh-Taylor mixing flow. Finally, we provide a scaling argument for detecting the onset of the quadratic, self-similar Rayleigh-Taylor growth. ? 2006 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

We also assess the performance of the package, in comparison with publicly distributed interface codes (the level set method), with published performance results (VOF and other methods) and with previous versions of front tracking. The major new algorithm presented here is Locally Grid Based tracking, which combines the best features of two previous 3D tracking algorithms. It combines the robustness of grid-based tracking with the accuracy of grid free tracking and thus it is a significant improvement to both these algorithms. We also discuss the surface curvature and normal algorithims and a higher order propagation algorithm, used for the comparison studies presented here.

The data are stored using tree-like structure with tree roots starting at a priori defined level of resolution. Both static and dynamic domain partitioning approaches are developed. For the dynamic domain partitioning, trees are considered to be the minimum quanta of data to be migrated between the processes. This allows fully automated and efficient handling of non-simply connected partitioning of a computational domain. Dynamic load balancing is achieved via domain repartitioning during the grid adaptation step and reassigning trees to the appropriate processes to ensure approximately the same number of grid points on each process. The parallel efficiency of the approach is discussed based on parallel adaptive wavelet-based Coherent Vortex Simulations of homogeneous turbulence with linear forcing at effective non-adaptive resolutions up to 20483 using as many as 2048 CPU cores.},

The streamwise interfacial and spanwise interfacial perturbations were measured using high-resolution thermocouples and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF), respectively. The initial multi-mode streamwise velocity perturbations at the two-fluid density interface were measured using particle-image velocimetry (PIV). It was found that the measured initial conditions describe an initially anisotropic state, in which the perturbations in the streamwise and spanwise directions are independent of one another. The evolution of various fluctuating velocity and density statistics, together with velocity and density variance spectra, were measured using PIV and high-resolution thermocouple data. The evolution of the velocity and density statistics is used to investigate the early-time evolution and the onset of strongly nonlinear, transitional dynamics within the mixing layer. The early-time evolution of the density and vertical velocity variance spectra indicate that velocity fluctuations are the dominant mechanism driving the instability development. The implications of the present experimental measurements on the initialization of Reynolds-averaged turbulent transport and mixing models and of direct and large-eddy simulations of Rayleigh-Taylor instability-induced turbulence are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = { The homogenization of a heterogeneous mixture of two pure fluids with different densities by molecular diffusion and stirring induced by buoyancy-generated motions, as occurs in the Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) instability, is studied using direct numerical simulations. The Schmidt number, Sc , is varied by a factor of 20, 0.1 ≤ Sc ≤ 2.0, and the Atwood number, A , by a factor of 10, 0.05 ≤ A ≤ 0.5. Initial-density intensities are as high as 50{\%} of the mean density. As a consequence of differential accelerations experienced by the two fluids, substantial and important differences between the mixing in a variable-density flow, as compared to the Boussinesq approximation, are observed. In short, the pure heavy fluid mixes more slowly than the pure light fluid : an initially symmetric double delta density probability density function (PDF) is rapidly skewed and, only at long times and low density fluctuations, does it relax to a Gaussian-like PDF. The heavy–light fluid mixing process asymmetry is relevant to the nature of molecular mixing on different sides of a high-Atwood-number RT layer. Diverse mix metrics are used to examine the homogenization of the two fluids. The conventional mix parameter, $\theta$, is mathematically related to the variance of the excess reactant of a hypothetical fast chemical reaction. Bounds relating $\theta$ and the normalized product, $\Xi$ , are derived. It is shown that $\theta$ underpredicts the mixing, as compared to $\Xi$ , in the central regions of an RT layer; in the edge regions, $\theta$ is larger than $\Xi$ . The shape of the density PDF cannot be inferred from the usual mix metrics popular in applications. For example, when $\theta$, $\Xi$ ≥ 0.6, characteristic of the interior of a fully developed RT layer, the PDFs can have vastly different shapes. Bounds on the fluid composition using two low-order moments of the density PDF are derived. The bounds can be used as realizability conditions for low-dimensional models. For the measures studied, the tightest bounds are obtained using $\Xi$ and mean density. The structure of the flow is also examined. It is found that, at early times, the buoyancy production term in the spectral kinetic energy equation is important at all wavenumbers and leads to anisotropy at all scales of motion. At later times, the anisotropy is confined to the largest and smallest scales: the intermediate scales are more isotropic than the small scales . In the viscous range, there is a cancellation between the viscous and nonlinear effects, and the buoyancy production leads to a persistent small-scale anisotropy. },

For the turbulent stress tensor the recently developed dynamic mixed model yields reasonable results. A priori estimates of the subgrid-terms in the filtered energy equation show that the usually neglected pressure-dilatation and turbulent dissipation rate are as large as the commonly retained pressure-velocity subgrid-term. Models for all these terms are proposed: a similarity model for the pressure-dilatation, similarity and k-dependent models for the turbulent dissipation rate and a dynamic mixed model for the pressure-velocity subgrid-term. Actual LES demonstrates that for a low Mach number all subgrid-terms in the energy equation can be neglected, while for a moderate Mach number the effect of the modelled turbulent dissipation rate is larger than the combined effect of the other modelled subgrid-terms in the filtered energy equation. {\textcopyright} 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

The inertial range scales of the turbulence are shown to quickly return to isotropy, and downstream of sufficiently strong shocks this process generates a net transfer of energy from transverse into streamwise velocity fluctuations. The streamwise shock displacements are shown to approximately follow a    {\$}k{\^{}}-11/3{\$}   decay with wavenumber as predicted by linear analysis. In conjunction with other statistics this suggests that the instantaneous interaction of the shock with the upstream turbulence proceeds in an approximately linear manner, but nonlinear effects immediately downstream of the shock significantly modify the flow even at the lowest considered turbulent Mach numbers. },

A nonlinear model and a stretched-vortex model are tested in LES of compressible decaying isotropic turbulence. Results of LES at 323, 483, and 643 resolution are compared to corresponding 2563 direct numerical simulations (DNS) at a turbulent Mach number, M1∼0.4. We use numerical schemes based on compact finite differences and study the effects of their order of accuracy on LES results. Both models give satisfactory agreement with DNS for the decay of the total turbulent kinetic energy. The probability densities (pdf) of energy transfer to subgrid scales obtained from filtered DNS and the SGS models are compared. Both models produce a narrower distribution of energy transfer than corresponding filtered DNS data, with less backscatter. The pdf of the alignment of components of the subgrid stress tensor and the eigenvectors of the rate-of-strain tensor obtained from the models reproduces some features of the DNS results. The pdfs of both energy transfer and relative eigenvector alignment are obtained from DNS and LES after about one large-eddy turnover time from the same initial condition. All tests of the present LES models are therefore a posteriori and none is a priori. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Dodd2014,
abstract = {We have developed a new pressure-correction method for simulating incompressible two-fluid flows with large density and viscosity ratios. The method's main advantage is that the variable coefficient Poisson equation that arises in solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for two-fluid flows is reduced to a constant coefficient equation, which can be solved with an FFT-based, fast Poisson solver. This reduction is achieved by splitting the variable density pressure gradient term in the governing equations. The validity of this splitting is demonstrated from our numerical tests, and it is explained from a physical viewpoint. In this paper, the new pressure-correction method is coupled with a mass-conserving volume-of-fluid method to capture the motion of the interface between the two fluids but, in general, it could be coupled with other interface advection methods such as level-set, phase-field, or front-tracking. First, we verified the new pressure-correction method using the capillary wave test-case up to density and viscosity ratios of 10,000. Then, we validated the method by simulating the motion of a falling water droplet in air and comparing the droplet terminal velocity with an experimental value. Next, the method is shown to be second-order accurate in space and time independent of the VoF method, and it conserves mass, momentum, and kinetic energy in the inviscid limit. Also, we show that for solving the two-fluid Navier-Stokes equations, the method is 10-40 times faster than the standard pressure-correction method, which uses multigrid to solve the variable coefficient Poisson equation. Finally, we show that the method is capable of performing fully-resolved direct numerical simulation (DNS) of droplet-laden isotropic turbulence with thousands of droplets using a computational mesh of 10243 points. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = { Dynamics and mixing of a variable-density turbulent flow subject to an externally imposed acceleration field in the zero-Mach-number limit are studied in a series of direct numerical simulations. The flow configuration studied consists of alternating slabs of high- and low-density fluid in a triply periodic domain. Density ratios in the range of    {\$}1.05\backslashleqslant R\backslashequiv \backslashunicode[STIX]x1D70C{\_}1/\backslashunicode[STIX]x1D70C{\_}2\backslashleqslant 10{\$}   are investigated. The flow produces temporally evolving shear layers. A perpendicular density–pressure gradient is maintained in the mean as the flow evolves, with multi-scale baroclinic torques generated in the turbulent flow that ensues. For all density ratios studied, the simulations attain Reynolds numbers at the beginning of the fully developed turbulence regime. An empirical relation for the convection velocity predicts the observed entrainment-ratio and dominant mixed-fluid composition statistics. Two mixing-layer temporal evolution regimes are identified: an initial diffusion-dominated regime with a growth rate    {\$}\backslashsimt{\^{}}1/2{\$}   followed by a turbulence-dominated regime with a growth rate    {\$}\backslashsimt{\^{}}3{\$}   . In the turbulent regime, composition probability density functions within the shear layers exhibit a slightly tilted (‘non-marching') hump, corresponding to the most probable mole fraction. The shear layers preferentially entrain low-density fluid by volume at all density ratios, which is reflected in the mixed-fluid composition. },

In this paper, we present high-resolution simulations which accurately solve all flow scales (including the shock-wave structure) and extensively cover the parameter space (the shock Mach number,    {\$}\backslashdef \backslashxmlpi {\#}1\backslashdef \backslashmathsfbi {\#}1\backslashboldsymbol \backslashmathsf {\#}1\backslashlet \backslashle =\backslashleqslant \backslashlet \backslashleq =\backslashleqslant \backslashlet \backslashge =\backslashgeqslant \backslashlet \backslashgeq =\backslashgeqslant \backslashdef \backslashPr \backslashmathit Pr\backslashdef \backslashFr \backslashmathit Fr\backslashdef \backslashRey \backslashmathit ReM{\_}s{\$}   , ranges from 1.1 to 2.2 and the Taylor Reynolds number,    {\$}\backslashmathitRe{\_}\backslashlambda {\$}   , ranges from 10 to 45).

The classical LIA formulae are extended to compute the complete post-shock flow fields using an IT database. The solutions, consistent with the DNS results, show that the shock wave significantly changes the topology of the turbulent structures, with a symmetrization of the third invariant of the velocity gradient tensor and (    {\$}M{\_}s{\$}   -mediated) of the probability density function (PDF) of the longitudinal velocity derivatives, and an    {\$}M{\_}s{\$}   -dependent increase in the correlation between strain and rotation. },
