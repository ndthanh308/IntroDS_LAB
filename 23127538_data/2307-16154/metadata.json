  "abstract": "We examine the validity of surface approximation for breakup reactions using a fully quantum-mechanical model proposed by Ichimura, Austern, and Vincent (IAV). Analogous to the semi-classical picture, we introduce radial cut-offs to scattering waves in the IAV framework, which we refer to as IAV-cut. Systematic calculations are conducted for nonelastic breakup reactions induced by $^6$Li and deuterons at various incident energies. A comparison between the results obtained from IAV and IAV-cut is performed. The excellent agreement observed between IAV and IAV-cut in $^{6}$Li induced reactions, regardless of incident energy and target nuclei, signifies their insensitivity to the inner part of the scattering wave function, thus providing validation for the semi-classical picture. However, for deuteron induced breakup reactions, the IAV-cut results exhibit a suppression in the cross section, suggesting a strong dependence on the interior wave functions. This suppression is further enhanced as the incident energy increases.",
