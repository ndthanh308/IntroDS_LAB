\section{Conclusion}
We introduced \system{}, a tool for creating AR-based \textit{explorable explanations} by augmenting static math textbooks. Using OCR and computer vision, our system automatically extracts contents from documents, enabling non-technical users to transform existing math textbooks into personalized, interactive documents without programming.
Our proof-of-concept system features five augmentation techniques, based on a taxonomy analysis of existing explorable explanations. 
We conducted two user studies to evaluate our system, and the results of our studies suggest that our system fosters more engaging learning experiences.
Future work includes applying our approach to different domains beyond math textbooks and investigating the potential for classroom use through in-the-wild deployment.
