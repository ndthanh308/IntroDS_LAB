  "abstract": "In this paper, we give presentations of the mapping class groups of marked surfaces stabilizing boundaries for any genus. Note that in the existing works, the mapping class groups of marked surfaces were the isotopy classes of homeomorphisms fixing boundaries pointwise. The condition for stabilizing boundaries of mapping class groups makes the requirement for mapping class groups to fix boundaries pointwise to be unnecessary. As an application of presentations of the mapping class groups of marked surfaces stabilizing boundaries, we obtain the presentation of the cluster automorphism group of a cluster algebra from a feasible surface $(S,M) $. Lastly, for the case (1) 4-punctured sphere, the cluster automorphism group of a cluster algebra from the surface is characterized. Since cluster automorphism groups of cluster algebras from those surfaces were given in \\cite{ASS} in the cases (2) the once-punctured 4-gon and (3) the twice-punctured digon, we indeed give presentations of cluster automorphism groups of cluster algebras from surfaces which are not feasible.",
