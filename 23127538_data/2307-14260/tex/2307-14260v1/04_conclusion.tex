\section{Concluding remarks}\label{sec:conclusion}

We conclude by discussing what needs to be done to determine the value of $\ed_{\Forb(C_h^t)}(p)$ for $p \in [0,p_0]$. For notational simplicity we discuss this only for the case $t=1$ (i.e. for cycles), but we expect that any successful method for $t=1$ would extend to the cases $t\geq 2$, and improvements for $t=1$ would be interesting in their own right.

For $t=1$, consider the following setup.
\begin{setup}\label{setup:t_equals_1}
Let $2 \mid h$, let $n \geq h$ and let $p \in (0,p_0]$. Suppose $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices, and $\boldx \colon V(G) \rightarrow [0,1]$ is such that $\sum_{v \in V(G)} \boldx(v) =1$. Suppose further that for any $v \in V(G)$, 
\[
\sum_{u \in N(v)} \boldx(u) \geq \frac{\lb\ceil{\frac{h}{3}}-1\rb p}{1+\lb \ceil{\frac{h}{3}} -2 \rb p} + \frac{1-2p}{p} \boldx(v).
\]
\end{setup}
Suppose under \cref{setup:t_equals_1} we can prove that $G$ must contain a cycle with length in the range $\{h/2, \ldots, h\}$. Then this would prove that $\ed_{\Forb(C_h)}(p) = \gamma_{\Forb(C_h)}(p)$ for all $p \in (0,p_0]$. On the other hand, suppose that there is some way to construct $G$ satisfying \cref{setup:t_equals_1} without containing any cycles in the range $\{h/2, \ldots, h\}$. Then this would correspond to a CRG $K$ with vertex set $\VB(K) = V(G)$ and $\VW(K) = \emptyset$ such that 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\EW(K) = \emptyset$,
    \item $u v \in \EB(K)$ if and only if $u v \notin E(G)$, and
    \item $u v \in \EG(K)$ if and only if $u v \in E(G)$.
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, this CRG would satisfy that $g_K(p) < \gamma_{\Forb(C_h)}(p)$, and therefore would give another upper bound on the value of the edit distance function for $p \in (0, p_0]$. The authors would conjecture that the first of these holds, that is, that $\ed_{\Forb(C_h)}(p) = \gamma_{\Forb(C_h)}(p)$ for all $p \in (0,p_0]$, and any further improvements within this range would be interesting.
