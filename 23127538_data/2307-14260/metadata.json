  "abstract": "What is the minimum proportion of edges which must be added to or removed from a graph of density $p$ to eliminate all induced cycles of length $h$? The maximum of this quantity over all graphs of density $p$ is measured by the edit distance function, $\\text{ed}_{\\text{Forb}(C_h)}(p)$, a function which provides a natural metric between graphs and hereditary properties.\n  Martin determined $\\text{ed}_{\\text{Forb}(C_h)}(p)$ for all $p \\in [0,1]$ when $h \\in \\{3, \\ldots, 9\\}$ and determined $\\text{ed}_{\\text{Forb}(C_{10})}(p)$ for $p \\in [1/7, 1]$. Peck determined $\\text{ed}_{\\text{Forb}(C_h)}(p)$ for all $p \\in [0,1]$ for odd cycles, and for $p \\in [ 1/\\lceil h/3 \\rceil, 1]$ for even cycles. In this paper, we fully determine the edit distance function for $C_{10}$ and $C_{12}$. Furthermore, we improve on the result of Peck for even cycles, by determining $\\text{ed}_{\\text{Forb}(C_h)}(p)$ for all $p \\in [p_0, 1/\\lceil h/3 \\rceil ]$, where $p_0 \\leq c/h^2$ for a constant $c$. More generally, if $C_h^t$ is the $t$-th power of the cycle $C_h$, we determine $\\text{ed}_{\\text{Forb}(C_h^t)}(p)$ for all $p \\geq p_0$ in the case when $(t+1) \\mid h$, thus improving on earlier work of Berikkyzy, Martin and Peck.",
