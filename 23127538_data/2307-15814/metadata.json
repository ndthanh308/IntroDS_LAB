  "abstract": "In this paper we discuss computer simulations of de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetimes, which are maximally symmetric, relativistic analogs of non-Euclidean geometries. We present prototype games played in these spacetimes; such games and visualizations can help the players gain intuition about these spacetimes. We discuss the technical challenges in creating such simulations, and discuss the geometric and relativistic effects that can be witnessed by the players.",
