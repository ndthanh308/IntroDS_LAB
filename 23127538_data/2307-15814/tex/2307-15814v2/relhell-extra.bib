abstract={We show that the large-N limits of certainconformal field theories in various dimensions includein their Hilbert space a sector describing supergravityon the product of anti-de Sitter spacetimes, spheres, and other compact manifolds. This is shown bytaking some branes in the full M/string theory and thentaking a low-energy limit where the field theory on thebrane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust thenear-horizon geometry for large N. The enhancedsupersymmetries of the near-horizon geometry correspondto the extra supersymmetry generators present in thesuperconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincaregroup). The 't Hooft limit of 3 + 1 N = 4 super-Yang{\^a}{\texteuro}``Mills at the conformal pointis shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings. Weconjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various anti-de Sitterspacetimes is dual to various conformal field theories.This leads to a new proposal for a definition ofM-theory which could be extended to include fivenoncompact dimensions.},

title = {How not to construct an asymptotically de Sitter universe},
journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {Observational evidence suggests that our universe is currently evolving towards an asymptotically de Sitter future. Unfortunately and in spite of much recent attention, various quantum, holographic and cosmological aspects of de Sitter space remain quite enigmatic. With such intrigue in mind, this paper considers the â€˜constructionâ€™ of a toy model that describes an asymptotically de Sitter universe. More specifically, we add fluid-like matter to an otherwise purely de Sitter spacetime, formulate the relevant solutions and then discuss the cosmological and holographic implications. If the objective is to construct an asymptotically de Sitter universe that is free of singularities and has a straightforward holographic interpretation, then the results of this analysis are decidedly negative. Nonetheless, this toy model nicely illustrates the pitfalls that might be encountered in a more realistic type of construction.}

 abstract = {No living geometer writes more clearly and beautifully about difficult topics than world famous professor H. S. M. Coxeter. When non-Euclidean geometry was first developed, it seemed little more than a curiosity with no relevance to the real world. Then to everyone’s amazement, it turned out to be essential to Einstein’s general theory of relativity! Coxeter’s book has remained out of print for too long. Hats off to the MAA for making this classic available once more — Martin Gardner Coxeter’s geometry books are a treasure that should not be lost. I am delighted to see “Non-Euclidean Geometry” back in print. — Doris Schattschneider Throughout most of this book, non-Euclidean geometries in spaces of two or three dimensions are treated as specializations of real projective geometry in terms of a simple set of axioms concerning points, lines, planes, incidence, order and continuity, with no mention of the measurement of distances or angles. This synthetic development is followed by the introduction of homogeneous coordinates, beginning with Von Staudt’s idea of regarding points as entities that can be added or multiplied. Tranformations that preserve incidence are called collineations. They lead in a natural way to isometries or “congruent transformations.” Following a recommendation by Bertrand Russell, continuity is described in terms of order. Elliptic and hyperbolic geometries are derived from real projective geometry by specializing an elliptic or hyperbolic polarity which transforms points into lines (in two dimensions) or planes (in three dimensions) and vice versa.},
