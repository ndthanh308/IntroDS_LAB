The orbit raising problem \cite{Bryson1975,Fahroo2008,Garg2011} is concerned with the fixed-time transfer between two circular orbits such that the radius of the final orbit is maximized.
Here it has been adapted such that the mass of the system is included as a state, and therefore the dynamic equations are time-invariant.
The problem is stated as follows.
\begin{prob} \label{prob:orbit-raising}
    Determine $r(t)$, $\theta(t)$, $v_r(t)$, $v_\theta(t)$, $m(t)$ and $\beta(t)$, $\forall t \in \closedinterval{0}{t_f}$ such that
\begin{equation}
     -r(t_f)
\end{equation}
is minimized, subject to the equations of motion
\begin{align}
    \dot{r}(t) &= v_r(t) \,, \\ 
    \dot{\theta}(t) &= \tfrac{v_\theta(t)}{r(t)} \,, \\ 
    \dot{v}_r(t) &= \tfrac{v_\theta^2(t)}{r(t)} - \tfrac{\mu}{r^2(t)} + \tfrac{T}{m(t)} \sin \beta(t) \,,   \\
    \dot{v}_\theta(t) &= - \tfrac{v_r(t) v_\theta(t)}{r(t)} + \tfrac{T}{m(t)} \cos \beta(t) \,, \\ 
    \dot{m}(t) &=-\alpha \,, 
\end{align}
the initial conditions
\begin{align}
    r(0) &= 1 \,, \\
    \theta(0) &= 0 \,, \\
    v_r(0) &= 0 \,, \\
    v_\theta(0) &= 1 \,, \\
    m(0) &= 1 \,,
\end{align}
and the terminal conditions
\begin{align}
    v_r(t_f) &= 0 \,, \\
    v_\theta(t_f) - \sqrt{\tfrac{\mu}{r(t_f)}} &= 0 \,,
\end{align}
where $t_f = \num{3.32}$, $T = \num{0.1405}$, $\mu =\num{1}$, and $\alpha = \num{0.0749}$.
\end{prob}

Problem \ref{prob:orbit-raising} is solved with the new method for $N=\num{25}$. In this context, Fig. \ref{fig:orbit-raising-state} and Fig. \ref{fig:orbit-raising-costate} show the obtained trajectories of state and costate, respectively. The profiles are in agreement with literature, see, \emph{e.g.}, \cite{Garg2011,Fahroo2008}.
