  "abstract": "We present FinTree, Financial Dataset Pretrain Transformer Encoder for Relation Extraction. Utilizing an encoder language model, we further pretrain FinTree on the financial dataset, adapting the model in financial domain tasks. FinTree stands out with its novel structure that predicts a masked token instead of the conventional [CLS] token, inspired by the Pattern Exploiting Training methodology. This structure allows for more accurate relation predictions between two given entities. The model is trained with a unique input pattern to provide contextual and positional information about the entities of interest, and a post-processing step ensures accurate predictions in line with the entity types. Our experiments demonstrate that FinTree outperforms on the REFinD, a large-scale financial relation extraction dataset. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/HJ-Ok/FinTree.",
