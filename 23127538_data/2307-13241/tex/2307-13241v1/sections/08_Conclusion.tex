In this work, we propose a low cost, efficient document image quality assessment method to estimate the visual quality of raster image content in scanned document pages under different resolution settings. We conduct a psychophysical experiment to collect human subject ratings of the visual quality of a variety of scanned documents. These ratings are used to train a machine learning model to determine whether the raster image in a scanned document page is visually acceptable or not at a given resolution. As the visual quality ratings are imbalanced for our dataset, we select three noise models to simulate the quality degradation during the scanning process and use them to augment the images in the original dataset. We leverage a feature selection strategy to determine the most relevant features to boost the performance of the classifier.  Our results show significant improvement by including augmented data in training for classification.
