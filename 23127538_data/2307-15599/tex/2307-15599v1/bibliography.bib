In particular, the behavior of high frequency market makers is highly related to its value. We take the point of view of an exchange and investigate the relevance of having different tick sizes on the bid and ask sides of the order book. Using an approach based on the model with uncertainty zones, we show that when side-specific tick sizes are suitably chosen, it enables the exchange to improve the quality of liquidity provision.},

Our approach consists in designing a stochastic mechanism for deriving the transaction prices from the latent efficient price. The main idea behind the model is that, if a transaction occurs at some value on the tick grid and leads to a price change, then the efficient price has been close enough to this value shortly before the transaction. We call uncertainty zones the bands around the mid-tick grid where the efficient price is too far from the tick grid to trigger a price change. In our setting, the width of these uncertainty zones quantifies the aversion to price changes of the market participants. Furthermore, this model enables us to derive approximated values of the efficient price at some random times, which is particularly useful for building statistical procedures. Convincing results are obtained through a simulation study and the use of the model over 10 representative stocks.},

	title = {Ultra high frequency volatility and co-volatility estimation in a microstructure model with uncertainty zones},
	abstract = {We consider a structural model for the microstructure noise which accommodates the inherent properties of ultra high frequency data with the assumption of a continuous efficient price process. Our model allows for transaction price increments of one or several ticks, the size of the price jumps being determined by explanatory variables involving for example the order book. Moreover, it enables to reproduce the main stylized facts of returns, durations and microstructure noise. Mostly, it agrees with the following postulates: (i) the latent efficient price of the asset is a continuous Ito semi-martingale; (ii) if a transaction occurs at some value on the tick grid and leads to a price change, then the efficient price has been close enough to this value shortly before the transaction. So, we call uncertainty zones the bands around the mid-tick grid where the efficient price is too far from the tick grid to trigger a price change. In our setting, the width of these uncertainty zones quantifies the aversion to price changes of the market participants. From the observation of the last traded price, we build an estimator of the integrated volatility of the asset over a fixed interval [0, T ] and provide its asymptotic theory as the tick size goes to zero. We also give a consistent estima-tor of the integrated co-volatility in the case when two assets are observed.},

Then we derive the equations defining the optimal contract to be set between the market maker and the exchange. This contract depends on the trading flows generated by the market maker's activity on the two venues. In both cases, we show existence and uniqueness, in the viscosity sense, of the solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to the market maker and exchange's problems.

He incorporates many examples and applications that illustrate the power and utility of this theory in a range of disciplines-from analysis and number theory to statistics, engineering, economics, and population biology. With an emphasis on the simplicity of the mathematics and smooth transitions between topics, the Second Edition boasts major revisions of the sections on dependent random variables as well as new sections on relative measure, on lacunary trigonometric series, and on the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution as a description of the long cycles in permutations and the large divisors of integers. Assuming only standard measure-theoretic probability and metric-space topology, Convergence of Probability Measures provides statisticians and mathematicians with basic tools of probability theory as well as a springboard to the industrial-strength literature available today.},

We characterize the value of an order and show that it plays the role of one-period reward in the MDP model. Based on this characterization, we provide explicit criteria for assessing the profitability of market making when there is latency. Under our model, we show that a market maker can earn a positive expected profit if there are sufficient uninformed market orders hitting the market maker's limit orders compared with the rate of price jumps, and the trading horizon is sufficiently long. In addition, our theoretical and numerical results suggest that latency can be an additional source of risk and latency impacts negatively the performance of market makers.},

More precisely, for a list of assets, they set prices at which they agree to buy and sell. Market makers face therefore an interesting optimization problem: they need to choose bid and ask prices for making money while mitigating the risk associated with holding inventory in a volatile market. Many market-making models have been proposed in the academic literature, most of them dealing with single-asset market making whereas market makers are usually in charge of a long list of assets. The rare models tackling multiasset market making suffer however from the curse of dimensionality when it comes to the numerical approximation of the optimal quotes. The goal of this paper is to propose a dimensionality reduction technique to address multiasset market making by using a factor model. Moreover, we generalize existing market-making models by the addition of an important feature: the existence of different transaction sizes and the possibility for the market makers in OTC markets to answer different prices to requests with different sizes.},

	abstract = {In this work we introduce two variants of multivariate Hawkes models with an explicit dependency on various queue sizes aimed at modeling the stochastic time evolution of a limit order book. The models we propose thus integrate the influence of both the current book state and the past order flow. The first variant considers the flow of order arrivals at a specific price level as independent from the other one and describes this flow by adding a Hawkes component to the arrival rates provided by the continuous time Markov "Queue Reactive" model of Huang et al. Empirical calibration using Level-I order book data from Eurex future assets (Bund and DAX) show that the Hawkes term dramatically improves the pure "Queue-Reactive" model not only for the description of the order flow properties (as e.g. the statistics of inter-event times) but also with respect to the shape of the queue distributions. The second variant we introduce describes the joint dynamics of all events occurring at best bid and ask sides of some order book during a trading day. This model can be considered as a queue dependent extension of the multivariate Hawkes order-book model of Bacry et al. We provide an explicit way to calibrate this model either with a Maximum-Likelihood method or with a Least-Square approach. Empirical estimation from Bund and DAX level-I order book data allow us to recover the main features of Hawkes interactions uncovered in Bacry et al. but also to unveil their joint dependence on bid and ask queue sizes. We notably find that while the market order or mid-price changes rates can mainly be functions on the volume imbalance this is not the case for the arrival rate of limit or cancel orders. Our findings also allows us to clearly bring to light various features that distinguish small and large tick assets.},

To do so, we split the time interval of interest into periods in which a well chosen reference price, typically the midprice, remains constant. Within these periods, we view the limit order book as a Markov queuing system. Indeed, we assume that the intensities of the order flows only depend on the current state of the order book. We establish the limiting behavior of this model and estimate its parameters from market data. Then, to design a relevant model for the whole period of interest, we use a stochastic mechanism that allows to switch from one period of constant reference price to another. Beyond enabling to reproduce accurately the behavior of market data, we show that our framework can be very useful for practitioners, notably as a market simulator or as a tool for the transaction cost analysis of complex trading algorithms.},

Hence they face a complex optimization problem in which their return, based on the bid-ask spread they quote and the frequency at which they indeed provide liquidity, is challenged by the price risk they bear due to their inventory. In this paper, we consider a stochastic control problem similar to the one introduced by Ho and Stoll (J Fin Econ 9(1): 47–73, 1981) and formalized mathematically by Avellaneda and Stoikov (Quant Fin 8(3):217–224, 2008). The market is modeled using a reference price Stfollowing a Brownian motion with standard deviation σ, arrival rates of buy or sell liquidity-consuming orders depend on the distance to the reference price Stand a market maker maximizes the expected utility of its P\&L over a finite time horizon. We show that the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations associated to the stochastic optimal control problem can be transformed into a system of linear ordinary differential equations and we solve the market making problem under inventory constraints. We also shed light on the asymptotic behavior of the optimal quotes and propose closed-form approximations based on a spectral characterization of the optimal quotes.},

	abstract = {This paper is split in three parts: first, we use labeled trade data to exhibit how market participants’ decisions depend on liquidity imbalance; then, we develop a stochastic control framework where agents monitor limit orders, by exploiting liquidity imbalance, to reduce adverse selection. For limit orders, we need optimal strategies essentially to find a balance between fast execution and avoiding adverse selection: if the price has chances to go down, the probability to be filled is high, but it is better to wait a little more to get a better price. In a third part, we show how the added value of exploiting liquidity imbalance is eroded by latency: being able to predict future liquidity consuming flows is of less use if you do not have enough time to cancel and reinsert your limit orders. There is thus a rationale for market makers to be as fast as possible to reduce adverse selection. Latency costs of our limit order driven strategy can be measured numerically.

To authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to make the connection between empirical evidences, a stochastic framework for limit orders including adverse selection, and the cost of latency. Our work is a first step to shed light on the role played by latency and adverse selection in optimal limit order placement.},

We first study the properties of BSDEs driven by a Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure. In particular, we provide a comparison theorem under quite weak assumptions, extending that of Royer  [21]. We then give some properties of dynamic risk measures induced by BSDEs with jumps. We provide a representation property of such dynamic risk measures in the convex case as well as some results on a robust optimization problem in the case of model ambiguity.},

The first approach develops a sketch of proof proposed by Fleming and Souganidis [Indiana Univ. Math. J., 38 (1989), pp. 293--314]. The second approach is based on an enlargement of the original state space and a controlled martingale problem. We clarify some measurability and topological issues raised by these two approaches.},

	abstract = {This book is designed as a text for graduate courses in stochastic processes. It is written for readers familiar with measure-theoretic probability and discrete-time processes who wish to explore stochastic processes in continuous time. The vehicle chosen for this exposition is Brownian motion, which is presented as the canonical example of both a martingale and a Markov process with continuous paths. In this context, the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic calculus is developed. The power of this calculus is illustrated by results concerning representations of martingales and change of measure on Wiener space, and these in turn permit a presentation of recent advances in financial economics (option pricing and consumption/investment optimization).  This book contains a detailed discussion of weak and strong solutions of stochastic differential equations and a study of local time for semimartingales, with special emphasis on the theory of Brownian local time. The text is complemented by a large number of problems and exercises.},

The bible on Markov chains in general state spaces has been brought up to date to reflect developments in the field since 1996 - many of them sparked by publication of the first edition. The pursuit of more efficient simulation algorithms for complex Markovian models, or algorithms for computation of optimal policies for controlled Markov models, has opened new directions for research on Markov chains. As a result, new applications have emerged across a wide range of topics including optimisation, statistics, and economics. New commentary and an epilogue by Sean Meyn summarise recent developments and references have been fully updated.

By including preparatory chapters on topics such as potential theory and functional analysis, we have attempted to make the work accessible to a broad spectrum of readers. Above all, we hope the readers of this book will gain an appreciation of the multitude of ingenious barehanded techniques that have been developed in the study of elliptic equations and have become part of the repertoire of analysis.

We solve this optimal liquidation problem for power-law and exponential-decay order book models explicitly and discuss several extensions. We also consider the continuous selling (or fluid) limit when the trading units are ever smaller and the intensity is ever larger. This limit provides an analytical approximation to the value function and the optimal solution. Using techniques from viscosity solutions we show that the discrete state problem and its optimal solution converge to the corresponding quantities in the continuous selling limit uniformly on compacts.},

The main idea is to show that the FBSDE admits a unique linearized version interpreted as its distributional derivative with respect to the initial condition. If the diffusion coefficient of the forward equation is uniformly elliptic, we approximate the FBSDE by smooth ones and use Krylov’s estimate to prove the convergence of the derivatives.

In the context of market making, we demonstrate that market makers (MMs) adjust their quotes  to  reduce  inventory risk  and adverse selection costs. Moreover, robust market making increases the strategies' Sharpe ratio and allows the MM to fine tune the trade-off between the mean and the standard deviation of profits.  We provide analytical solutions for the robust optimal strategies, show that the resulting dynamic programming equations have classical solutions, and provide a proof of verification. The behavior of the ambiguity averse MM is found to generalize those of a risk averse MM and coincide in a limiting case.},

Moreover, using MRP, we can model the alternating of time intervals with high and low market activity, and consider dependence between price increments and jump times. We also provide simple parametric and nonparametric statistical procedures for the estimation of our model.

	abstract = {We propose a framework for studying optimal market-making policies in a limit order book (LOB). The bid–ask spread of the LOB is modeled by a tick-valued continuous-time Markov chain. We consider a small agent who continuously submits limit buy/sell orders at best bid/ask quotes, and may also set limit orders at best bid (resp. ask) plus (resp. minus) a tick for obtaining execution order priority, which is a crucial issue in high-frequency trading. The agent faces an execution risk since her limit orders are executed only when they meet counterpart market orders. She is also subject to inventory risk due to price volatility when holding the risky asset. The agent can then also choose to trade with market orders, and therefore obtain immediate execution, but at a less favorable price. The objective of the market maker is to maximize her expected utility from revenue over a short-term horizon by a trade-off between limit and market orders, while controlling her inventory position. This is formulated as a mixed regime switching regular/impulse control problem that we characterize in terms of a quasi-variational system by dynamic programming methods. Calibration procedures are derived for estimating the transition matrix and intensity parameters for the spread and for Cox processes modelling the execution of limit orders. We provide an explicit backward splitting scheme for solving the problem and show how it can be reduced to a system of simple equations involving only the inventory and spread variables. Several computational tests are performed both on simulated and real data, and illustrate the impact and profit when considering execution priority in limit orders and market orders.},

We discuss the consequences of the two main features of this microstructure: first, the limit orders are only partially executed, and therefore she has no control on the executed quantity. Second, the high-frequency trader faces the overtrading risk, which is the risk of large variations in her inventory. The consequences of this risk are investigated in the context of optimal liquidation. The optimal trading problem is studied by stochastic control and dynamic programming methods, and we provide the associated numerical resolution procedure and prove its convergence. We propose dimension reduction techniques in several cases of practical interest.

In this context, the limit orders, market orders, and cancel orders arrivals in the order book are modeled as point processes with intensities that only depend on the state of the order book. These are high-dimensional models which are realistic from a micro-structure point of view and have been recently developed in the literature. In this context, we consider a market maker who stands ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price, and identifies the strategies that maximize their P\&L penalized by their inventory. An extension of the methodology is proposed to solve market-making problems where the orders arrivals are modeled using Hawkes processes with exponential kernel.We apply the theory of Markov Decision Processes and dynamic programming method to characterize analytically the solutions to our optimal market-making problem. The second part of the paper deals with the numerical aspect of the high-dimensional trading problem. We use a control randomization method combined with quantization method to compute the optimal strategies. Several computational tests are performed on simulated data to illustrate the efficiency of the computed optimal strategy. In particular, we simulated an order book with constant/ symmetric/ asymmetrical/ state dependent intensities, and compared the computed optimal strategy with naive strategies.

The exchange wishes to establish a suitable make–take fee policy to attract transactions on its venues. We first solve the stochastic control problem of the market maker without the intervention of the exchange. Then, we derive the equations defining the optimal contract to be set between the market maker and the exchange. This contract depends on the trading flows generated by the market maker’s activity on the two venues. In both cases, we show existence and uniqueness in the viscosity sense of the solutions of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations associated to the market maker and exchange’s problems. We finally design an actor–critic algorithm inspired by deep reinforcement learning methods, enabling us to approximate efficiently the optimal controls of the market maker and the optimal incentives to be provided by the exchange.

	abstract = {In dealer markets, dealers provide prices at which they agree to buy and sell the assets and securities they have in their scope. With ever increasing trading volume, this quoting task has to be done algorithmically in most markets such as foreign exchange (FX) markets or corporate bond markets. Over the last 10 years, many mathematical models have been designed that can be the basis of quoting algorithms in dealer markets. Nevertheless, in most (if not all) models, the dealer is a pure internalizer, setting quotes and waiting for clients. However, on many dealer markets, dealers also have access to an interdealer market or even public trading venues where they can hedge part of their inventory. In this paper, we propose a model taking this possibility into account therefore allowing dealers to externalize part of their risk. The model displays an important feature well known to practitioners that within a certain inventory range, the dealer internalizes the flow by appropriately adjusting the quotes and starts externalizing outside of that range. The larger the franchise, the wider is the inventory range suitable for pure internalization. The model is illustrated numerically with realistic parameters for USDCNH spot market.},

	abstract = {We consider coherent sublinear expectations on a measurable space, without assuming the existence of a dominating probability measure. By considering a decomposition of the space in terms of the supports of the measures representing our sublinear expectation, we give a simple construction, in a quasi-sure sense, of the (linear) conditional expectations, and hence give a representation for the conditional sublinear expectation. We also show an aggregation property holds, and give an equivalence between consistency and a pasting property of measures.},
