    \field{abstract}{%
    We propose a microstructural modeling framework for studying optimal
  market-making policies in a FIFO (first in first out) limit order book (order
  book). In this context, the limit orders, market orders, and cancel orders
  arrivals in the order book are modeled as point processes with intensities
  that only depend on the state of the order book. These are high-dimensional
  models which are realistic from a micro-structure point of view and have been
  recently developed in the literature. In this context, we consider a market
  maker who stands ready to buy and sell stock on a regular and continuous
  basis at a publicly quoted price, and identifies the strategies that maximize
  their P\&L penalized by their inventory. An extension of the methodology is
  proposed to solve market-making problems where the orders arrivals are
  modeled using Hawkes processes with exponential kernel.We apply the theory of
  Markov Decision Processes and dynamic programming method to characterize
  analytically the solutions to our optimal market-making problem. The second
  part of the paper deals with the numerical aspect of the high-dimensional
  trading problem. We use a control randomization method combined with
  quantization method to compute the optimal strategies. Several computational
  tests are performed on simulated data to illustrate the efficiency of the
  computed optimal strategy. In particular, we simulated an order book with
  constant/ symmetric/ asymmetrical/ state dependent intensities, and compared
  the computed optimal strategy with naive strategies. Some codes are available
  on https://github.com/comeh.%

    The tick size, which is the smallest increment between two consecutive
  prices for a given asset, is a key parameter of market microstructure. In
  particular, the behavior of high frequency market makers is highly related to
  its value. We take the point of view of an exchange and investigate the
  relevance of having different tick sizes on the bid and ask sides of the
  order book. Using an approach based on the model with uncertainty zones, we
  show that when side-specific tick sizes are suitably chosen, it enables the
  exchange to improve the quality of liquidity provision.%

    We consider the issue of a market maker acting at the same time in the lit
  and dark pools of an exchange. The exchange wishes to establish a suitable
  make–take fee policy to attract transactions on its venues. We first solve
  the stochastic control problem of the market maker without the intervention
  of the exchange. Then, we derive the equations defining the optimal contract
  to be set between the market maker and the exchange. This contract depends on
  the trading flows generated by the market maker’s activity on the two
  venues. In both cases, we show existence and uniqueness in the viscosity
  sense of the solutions of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equations
  associated to the market maker and exchange’s problems. We finally design
  an actor–critic algorithm inspired by deep reinforcement learning methods,
  enabling us to approximate efficiently the optimal controls of the market
  maker and the optimal incentives to be provided by the exchange. Funding:

    In dealer markets, dealers provide prices at which they agree to buy and
  sell the assets and securities they have in their scope. With ever increasing
  trading volume, this quoting task has to be done algorithmically in most
  markets such as foreign exchange (FX) markets or corporate bond markets. Over
  the last 10 years, many mathematical models have been designed that can be
  the basis of quoting algorithms in dealer markets. Nevertheless, in most (if
  not all) models, the dealer is a pure internalizer, setting quotes and
  waiting for clients. However, on many dealer markets, dealers also have
  access to an interdealer market or even public trading venues where they can
  hedge part of their inventory. In this paper, we propose a model taking this
  possibility into account therefore allowing dealers to externalize part of
  their risk. The model displays an important feature well known to
  practitioners that within a certain inventory range, the dealer internalizes
  the flow by appropriately adjusting the quotes and starts externalizing
  outside of that range. The larger the franchise, the wider is the inventory
  range suitable for pure internalization. The model is illustrated numerically
  with realistic parameters for USDCNH spot market.%

    In most over-the-counter (OTC) markets, a small number of market makers
  provide liquidity to other market participants. More precisely, for a list of
  assets, they set prices at which they agree to buy and sell. Market makers
  face therefore an interesting optimization problem: they need to choose bid
  and ask prices for making money while mitigating the risk associated with
  holding inventory in a volatile market. Many market-making models have been
  proposed in the academic literature, most of them dealing with single-asset
  market making whereas market makers are usually in charge of a long list of
  assets. The rare models tackling multiasset market making suffer however from
  the curse of dimensionality when it comes to the numerical approximation of
  the optimal quotes. The goal of this paper is to propose a dimensionality
  reduction technique to address multiasset market making by using a factor
  model. Moreover, we generalize existing market-making models by the addition
  of an important feature: the existence of different transaction sizes and the
  possibility for the market makers in OTC markets to answer different prices
  to requests with different sizes.%

    This research monograph, first published in 1978 by Academic Press, remains
  the authoritative and comprehensive treatment of the mathematical foundations
  of stochastic optimal control of discrete-time systems, including the
  treatment of the intricate measure-theoretic issues. It is an excellent
  supplement to the first author\&\#39;s Dynamic Programming and Optimal
  Control (Athena Scientific, 2018).Review of the 1978
  printing:\&quot;Bertsekas and Shreve have written a fine book. The exposition
  is extremely clear and a helpful introductory chapter provides orientation
  and a guide to the rather intimidating mass of literature on the subject.
  Apart from anything else, the book serves as an excellent introduction to the
  arcane world of analytic sets and other lesser known byways of measure
  theory.\&quot;Mark H. A. Davis, Imperial College, in IEEE Trans. on Automatic

    We address the mechanism design problem of an exchange setting suitable
  make– take fees to attract liquidity on its platform. Using a
  principal–agent approach, we provide the optimal compensation scheme of a
  market maker in quasi-explicit form. This contract depends essentially on the
  market maker inventory trajectory and on the volatility of the asset. We also
  provide the optimal quotes that should be displayed by the market maker. The
  simplicity of our formulas allows us to analyze in details the effects of
  optimal contracting with an exchange, compared to a situation without
  contract. We show in particular that it improves liquidity and reduces
  trading costs for investors. We extend our study to an oligopoly of symmetric
  exchanges and we study the impact of such common agency policy on the
  system.%

    Algorithmic traders acknowledge that their models are incorrectly
  specified, thus we allow for ambiguity in their choices to make their models
  robust to misspecification in (i) the arrival rate of market orders, (ii) the
  fill probability of limit orders, and (iii) the dynamics of the midprice of
  the asset they deal. In the context of market making, we demonstrate that
  market makers (MMs) adjust their quotes to reduce inventory risk and adverse
  selection costs. Moreover, robust market making increases the strategies'
  Sharpe ratio and allows the MM to fine tune the trade-off between the mean
  and the standard deviation of profits. We provide analytical solutions for
  the robust optimal strategies, show that the resulting dynamic programming
  equations have classical solutions, and provide a proof of verification. The
  behavior of the ambiguity averse MM is found to generalize those of a risk
  averse MM and coincide in a limiting case.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    We propose a framework for studying optimal market-making policies in a
  limit order book (LOB). The bid–ask spread of the LOB is modeled by a
  tick-valued continuous-time Markov chain. We consider a small agent who
  continuously submits limit buy/sell orders at best bid/ask quotes, and may
  also set limit orders at best bid (resp. ask) plus (resp. minus) a tick for
  obtaining execution order priority, which is a crucial issue in
  high-frequency trading. The agent faces an execution risk since her limit
  orders are executed only when they meet counterpart market orders. She is
  also subject to inventory risk due to price volatility when holding the risky
  asset. The agent can then also choose to trade with market orders, and
  therefore obtain immediate execution, but at a less favorable price. The
  objective of the market maker is to maximize her expected utility from
  revenue over a short-term horizon by a trade-off between limit and market
  orders, while controlling her inventory position. This is formulated as a
  mixed regime switching regular/impulse control problem that we characterize
  in terms of a quasi-variational system by dynamic programming methods.
  Calibration procedures are derived for estimating the transition matrix and
  intensity parameters for the spread and for Cox processes modelling the
  execution of limit orders. We provide an explicit backward splitting scheme
  for solving the problem and show how it can be reduced to a system of simple
  equations involving only the inventory and spread variables. Several
  computational tests are performed both on simulated and real data, and
  illustrate the impact and profit when considering execution priority in limit
  orders and market orders.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    We propose a framework to study optimal trading policies in a one-tick pro
  rata limit order book, as typically arises in short-term interest rate
  futures contracts. The high-frequency trader chooses to post either market
  orders or limit orders, which are represented, respectively, by impulse
  controls and regular controls. We discuss the consequences of the two main
  features of this microstructure: first, the limit orders are only partially
  executed, and therefore she has no control on the executed quantity. Second,
  the high-frequency trader faces the overtrading risk, which is the risk of
  large variations in her inventory. The consequences of this risk are
  investigated in the context of optimal liquidation. The optimal trading
  problem is studied by stochastic control and dynamic programming methods, and
  we provide the associated numerical resolution procedure and prove its
  convergence. We propose dimension reduction techniques in several cases of
  practical interest. We also detail a high-frequency trading strategy in the
  case where a (predictive) directional information on the price is available.
  Each of the resulting strategies is illustrated by numerical tests.%

    Market makers continuously set bid and ask quotes for the stocks they have
  under consideration. Hence they face a complex optimization problem in which
  their return, based on the bid-ask spread they quote and the frequency at
  which they indeed provide liquidity, is challenged by the price risk they
  bear due to their inventory. In this paper, we consider a stochastic control
  problem similar to the one introduced by Ho and Stoll (J Fin Econ 9(1):
  47–73, 1981) and formalized mathematically by Avellaneda and Stoikov (Quant
  Fin 8(3):217–224, 2008). The market is modeled using a reference price
  Stfollowing a Brownian motion with standard deviation σ, arrival rates of
  buy or sell liquidity-consuming orders depend on the distance to the
  reference price Stand a market maker maximizes the expected utility of its
  P\&L over a finite time horizon. We show that the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman
  equations associated to the stochastic optimal control problem can be
  transformed into a system of linear ordinary differential equations and we
  solve the market making problem under inventory constraints. We also shed
  light on the asymptotic behavior of the optimal quotes and propose
  closed-form approximations based on a spectral characterization of the
  optimal quotes.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Through the analysis of a dataset of ultra high frequency order book
  updates, we introduce a model which accommodates the empirical properties of
  the full order book together with the stylized facts of lower frequency
  financial data. To do so, we split the time interval of interest into periods
  in which a well chosen reference price, typically the midprice, remains
  constant. Within these periods, we view the limit order book as a Markov
  queuing system. Indeed, we assume that the intensities of the order flows
  only depend on the current state of the order book. We establish the limiting
  behavior of this model and estimate its parameters from market data. Then, to
  design a relevant model for the whole period of interest, we use a stochastic
  mechanism that allows to switch from one period of constant reference price
  to another. Beyond enabling to reproduce accurately the behavior of market
  data, we show that our framework can be very useful for practitioners,
  notably as a market simulator or as a tool for the transaction cost analysis
  of complex trading algorithms.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    This paper is split in three parts: first, we use labeled trade data to
  exhibit how market participants’ decisions depend on liquidity imbalance;
  then, we develop a stochastic control framework where agents monitor limit
  orders, by exploiting liquidity imbalance, to reduce adverse selection. For
  limit orders, we need optimal strategies essentially to find a balance
  between fast execution and avoiding adverse selection: if the price has
  chances to go down, the probability to be filled is high, but it is better to
  wait a little more to get a better price. In a third part, we show how the
  added value of exploiting liquidity imbalance is eroded by latency: being
  able to predict future liquidity consuming flows is of less use if you do not
  have enough time to cancel and reinsert your limit orders. There is thus a
  rationale for market makers to be as fast as possible to reduce adverse
  selection. Latency costs of our limit order driven strategy can be measured
  numerically. To authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to make the
  connection between empirical evidences, a stochastic framework for limit
  orders including adverse selection, and the cost of latency. Our work is a
  first step to shed light on the role played by latency and adverse selection
  in optimal limit order placement.%

    Convex functions play an important role in almost all branches of
  mathematics as well as other areas of science and engineering. This book is a
  thorough introduction to contemporary convex function theory addressed to all
  people whose research or teaching interests intersect with the field of
  convexity. It covers a large variety of subjects, from the one real variable
  case (with all its mathematical gems) to some of the most advanced topics
  such as Choquet's theory, the Prékopa-Leindler type inequalities and their
  ramifications, as well as the variational approach of partial differential
  equations and convex programming. Many results are new and the whole book
  reflects the authors’ own experience, both in teaching and research. The
  book can serve as a reference and source of inspiration to researchers in
  several branches of mathematics and engineering and it can also be used for
  graduate courses.%

    In this paper, we provide a model which accommodates the assumption of a
  continuous efficient price with the inherent properties of
  ultra-high-frequency transaction data (price discreteness, irregular temporal
  spacing, diurnal patterns...). Our approach consists in designing a
  stochastic mechanism for deriving the transaction prices from the latent
  efficient price. The main idea behind the model is that, if a transaction
  occurs at some value on the tick grid and leads to a price change, then the
  efficient price has been close enough to this value shortly before the
  transaction. We call uncertainty zones the bands around the mid-tick grid
  where the efficient price is too far from the tick grid to trigger a price
  change. In our setting, the width of these uncertainty zones quantifies the
  aversion to price changes of the market participants. Furthermore, this model
  enables us to derive approximated values of the efficient price at some
  random times, which is particularly useful for building statistical
  procedures. Convincing results are obtained through a simulation study and
  the use of the model over 10 representative stocks.%
