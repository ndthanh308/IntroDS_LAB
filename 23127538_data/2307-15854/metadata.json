  "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the quantitative unique continuation, propagation of smallness and measure bounds of nodal sets of solutions to the Buckling type equation $\\triangle^2u+λ\\triangle u-k^2u=0$ in a bounded analytic domain $Ω\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the homogeneous boundary conditions $u=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partialν}=0$ on $\\partialΩ$, where $λ,\\ k$ are nonnegative real constants, and $ν$ is the outer unit normal vector on $\\partialΩ$. We obtain that, the upper bounds for the maximal vanishing order of $u$ and the $n-1$ dimensional Hausdorff measure of the nodal set of $u$ are both $C(\\sqrtλ+\\sqrt{k}+1)$, where $C$ is a positive constant only depending on $n$ and $Ω$. Moreover, we also give a quantitative result of the propagation of smallness of $u$.",
