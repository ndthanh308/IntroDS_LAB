  "abstract": "We apply a method (\"eLCQ\") to find the asymptotic spectrum of a Hamiltonian from its symmetries to two-dimensional adjoint QCD. Streamlining the approach, we construct a complete set of asymptotic eigenfunctions in all parton sectors and use it in a basis-function approach to find the spectrum of the full theory. We are able to reproduce previous results including the degeneracy of fermionic and bosonic masses at the supersymmetric point, and to understand the properties of the lowest states in the massless theory.\n  The approach taken here is continuous at fixed parton number, and therefore complementary to standard (DLCQ-like) formulations. Despite its limitation to rather small parton numbers, it can be used to test and validate conclusions of other frameworks in an independent way.",
