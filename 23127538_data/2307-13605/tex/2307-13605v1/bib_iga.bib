The developed discontinuous Galerkin approach avoids the need for mixed finite element methods, coupled equations or interpolation functions with a high degree of continuity that have been employed in the literature to treat the fourth-order spatial derivatives. The variational formulation of the discontinuous Galerkin method, its implementation and numerical examples are presented. In this communication, it is also shown under what conditions the method is stable, and an error estimate in an energy-type norm is presented. The method is evaluated by comparison with a standard finite element treatment in which the Cahn–Hilliard equation is decomposed into two coupled partial differential equations."

In this paper, we explore the variational imposition of essential boundary conditions that arise from the thermodynamic derivation of the Cahn–Hilliard equation in primal variables. Our formulation is based on the symmetric variant of Nitsche's method, does not introduce additional degrees of freedom and is shown to be variationally consistent. In contrast to strong enforcement, the new boundary condition formulation can be naturally applied to any mapped isogeometric parametrization of any polynomial degree. In addition, it preserves full accuracy, including higher-order rates of convergence, which we illustrate for boundary-fitted discretizations of several benchmark tests in one, two and three dimensions. Unfitted Cartesian B-spline meshes constitute an effective alternative to boundary-fitted isogeometric parametrizations for constructing C1-continuous discretizations, in particular for complex geometries. We combine our variational boundary condition formulation with unfitted Cartesian B-spline meshes and the finite cell method to simulate chemical phase segregation in a composite electrode. This example, involving coupling of chemical fields with mechanical stresses on complex domains and coupling of different materials across complex interfaces, demonstrates the flexibility of variational boundary conditions in the context of higher-order unfitted isogeometric discretizations."

	abstract = {Summary An efficient procedure for embedding kinematic boundary conditions in the biharmonic equation, for problems such as the pure streamfunction formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations and thin plate bending, is based on a stabilized variational formulation, obtained by Nitsche's approach for enforcing boundary constraints. The absence of kinematic admissibility constraints allows the use of non-conforming meshes with non-interpolatory approximations, thereby providing added flexibility in addressing the higher continuity requirements typical of these problems. Variationally conjugate pairs weakly enforce kinematic boundary conditions. The use of a scaling factor leads to a formulation with a single stabilization parameter. For plates, the enforcement of tangential derivatives of deflections obviates the need for pointwise enforcement of corner values in the presence of corners. The single stabilization parameter is determined from a local generalized eigenvalue problem, guaranteeing coercivity of the discrete bilinear form. The accuracy of the approach is verified by representative computations with bicubic B-splines, providing guidance to the determination of the scaling and exhibiting optimal rates of convergence and robust performance with respect to values of the stabilization parameter.

The current work studies the weak enforcement of such conditions for B-spline basis functions, with application to both second- and fourth-order problems. This is achieved using concepts borrowed from Nitsche's method, which is a stabilized method for imposing constraints on surfaces. Conditions for the stability of the system of equations are derived for each class of problem. Stability parameters in the Nitsche weak form are then evaluated by solving a local generalized eigenvalue problem at the Dirichlet boundary. The approach is designed to work equally well when the grid used to build the splines conforms to the physical boundary of interest as well as to the more general case when it does not. Through several numerical examples, the approach is shown to yield optimal rates of convergence. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Using the lubrication approximation, a coupled system of fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equations was derived to describe the spatio-temporal evolution of the continuous film thickness and surfactant interfacial concentration. Numerical solutions of these governing equations were obtained using the Numerical Method of Lines with appropriate initial and boundary conditions. A full parametric study was undertaken to explore the effect of the viscosity ratio, background surfactant concentration, the surface Péclet number, and van der Waals interaction forces on the dynamics of the draining film for the case where surfactant is present in trace amounts. Marangoni stresses were found to cause large deformations in the liquid film: Thickening of the film at the surfactant leading edge was accompanied by rapid and severe thinning far upstream. Under certain conditions, this severe thinning leads directly to film rupture due to the influence of van der Waals forces. Time scales for rupture, promoted by Marangoni-driven local film drainage were compared with those associated with the dimpling effect, which accompanies the approach of two drops, and implications of the results of this study on drop coalescence are discussed."

abstract="The spreading dynamics of surfactant molecules on a thin fluid layer is of both fundamental and practical interest. A mathematical model formulated by Gaver and Grotberg [J Fluid Mech 235:399--414, 1992] describing the spreading of a single layer of insoluble surfactant has become widely accepted, and several experiments on axisymmetric spreading have confirmed its predictions for both the height profile of the free surface and the spreading exponent (the radius of the circular area covered by surfactant grows as {\$}{\$}t^{\{}1/4{\}}{\$}{\$}t1/4). However, these prior experiments utilized primarily surfactant quantities exceeding (sometimes far exceeding) a monolayer. In this paper, we report that this regime is characterized by a mismatch between the timescales of the experiment and model and, additionally, find that the spatial distribution of surfactant molecules differs substantially from the model prediction. For experiments performed in the monolayer regime for which the model was developed, the surfactant layer is observed to have a spreading exponent of less than {\$}{\$}1/10{\$}{\$}1/10, far below the predicted value, and the surfactant distribution is also in disagreement. These findings suggest that the model is inadequate for describing the spreading of insoluble surfactants on thin fluid layers.",

A numerical method is developed in which the leading edge of the surfactant is tracked. In the absence of higher order regularization the system becomes hyperbolic/degenerate-parabolic, introducing jumps in the height of the free surface and the surfactant concentration gradient. We compare numerical simulations to those of a hybrid Godunov method in which the height equation is treated as a scalar conservation law and a parabolic solver is used for the surfactant equation. We show how the tracking method applies to the full equations with realistic gravity and capillarity terms included, even though the disturbance in the height of the free surface extends beyond the support of the surfactant concentration."

abstract = "This paper adapts the concept of residual-based shock-capturing viscosity to the setting of solid mechanics. To evaluate the residual of the momentum balance equation, one requires the divergence of the Cauchy stress. Solid constitutive models used in simulations of extreme events involving shocks typically specify the Cauchy stress in terms of a local rate equation rather than an explicit formula involving the current deformation gradient and/or strain rate; unlike in widely-used models for fluid mechanics, there is usually no closed-form expression for spatial derivatives of the solid Cauchy stress. We therefore investigate the evolution of stress gradients given rate-form models involving various objective rates of Cauchy stress. The rate equations we derive for the stress gradient are then integrated numerically to furnish the stress divergence needed to define the shock viscosity. The properties of this shock viscosity are demonstrated in benchmark problems using Lagrangian isogeometric analysis and an immersed isogeometric–meshfree simulation framework."

abstract = {Abstract The YZβ discontinuity-capturing operator, recently introduced in (Encyclopedia of Computational Mechanics, Vol. 3, Fluids. Wiley: New York, 2004) in the context of compressible flows, is applied to a time-dependent, scalar advection–diffusion equation with the purpose of modelling drug delivery processes in blood vessels. The formulation is recast in a residual-based form, which reduces to the previously proposed formulation in the limit of zero diffusion and source term. The NURBS-based isogeometric analysis method, proposed by Hughes et al. (Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng. 2005; 194:4135–4195), was used for the numerical tests. Effects of various parameters in the definition of the YZβ operator are examined on a model problem and the better performer is singled out. While for low-order B-spline functions discontinuity capturing is necessary to improve solution quality, we find that high-order, high-continuity B-spline discretizations produce sharp, nearly monotone layers without the aid of discontinuity capturing. Finally, we successfully apply the YZβ approach to the simulation of drug delivery in patient-specific coronary arteries. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = "Viscous flows occur when the effects of fluid viscosity are balanced by those arising from fluid inertia, body forces, and/or pressure gradients. In such flows, scaling analyses do not allow a priori neglect of any terms in the equations of fluid motion. However, under certain ideal geometrical circumstances involving locally parallel walls that confine the flow, relatively simple steady and unsteady exact solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are possible because the nonlinear advective acceleration is identically zero. Interestingly, the character of these exact solutions persists when the flow's geometry deviates mildly from ideal, a fact exploited in lubrication theory. When the flow's boundary and initial conditions do not impose a length or time scale, exact solutions may sometimes be determined in terms of a special combination of two independent variables known as a similarity variable. At sufficiently low Reynolds numbers, the influence of fluid inertia may be neglected (the creeping flow approximation) and this allows the low–Reynolds number viscous flow past a sphere to be determined."
