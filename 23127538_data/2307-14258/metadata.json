  "abstract": "Within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems, we demonstrate that an off-resonant high-frequency electromagnetic field can induce the Lifshitz phase transition in periodical structures described by the one-dimensional repulsive Hubbard model with the nearest and next-nearest-neighbor hopping. The transition changes the topology of electron energy spectrum at the Fermi level, transforming it from the two Fermi points to the four Fermi points, which facilitates the emergence of the superconducting fluctuations in the structure. Possible manifestations of the effect and conditions of its experimental observability are discussed.",
