USAGE:

\bibliographystyle{mybstfile}
\bibliography{IEEEfull,mybibfile}

where the IEEE titles in the .bib database entries use the strings
defined here. e.g.,


   journal = IEEE_J_AC,


to yield "{IEEE} Transactions on Automatic Control"


WARNING: IEEE uses abbreviated journal titles in their bibliographies!
Because this file provides the full titles, you should NOT use this file
for work that is to be submitted to the IEEE.

For IEEE work, you should use the abbreviated titles provided in the
companion file, IEEEabrv.bib.


** NOTES **

 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals - 
    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.

 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.

 3. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
    dating prior to IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).

ABSTRACT = {This study covers a self-powered wireless communication system that is powered using a piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) in a shoe. The lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) ceramic of the PEH was coated with UV resin, which (after curing under UV light) allowed it to withstand periodic pressure. The PEH was designed with a simple structure and placed under the sole of a shoe. The durability of the PEH was tested using a pushing tester and its applicability in shoes was examined. With periodic compression of 60 kg, the PEH produced 52 &mu;W of energy at 280 k&#8486;. The energy generated by the PEH was used to power a wireless transmitter. A step-down converter with an under-voltage lockout function was used to gather enough energy to operate the wireless transmitter. The transmitter can be operated initially after walking 24 steps. After the transmitter has been activated, it can be operated again after 8 steps. Because a control center receives signals from the transmitter, it is possible to check the status of workers who work outside at night or mostly alone, to detect emergencies.},

abstract = {We face the problem of gait recognition by using a robust deep learning model based on graphs. The proposed graph based learning approach, named Time based Graph Long Short-Term Memory (TGLSTM) network, is able to dynamically learn graphs when they may change during time, like in gait and action recognition. Indeed, the TGLSTM model jointly exploits structured data and temporal information through a deep neural network model able to learn long short-term dependencies together with graph structure. The experiments were made on popular datasets for action and gait recognition, MSR Action 3D, CAD-60, CASIA Gait B, “TUM Gait from Audio, Image and Depth” (TUM-GAID) datasets, investigating the advantages of TGLSTM with respect to state-of-the-art methods .}

ABSTRACT = {The internet of things (IoT) manages a large infrastructure of web-enabled smart devices, small devices that use embedded systems, such as processors, sensors, and communication hardware to collect, send, and elaborate on data acquired from their environment. Thus, from a practical point of view, such devices are composed of power-efficient storage, scalable, and lightweight nodes needing power and batteries to operate. From the above reason, it appears clear that energy harvesting plays an important role in increasing the efficiency and lifetime of IoT devices. Moreover, from acquiring energy by the surrounding operational environment, energy harvesting is important to make the IoT device network more sustainable from the environmental point of view. Different state-of-the-art energy harvesters based on mechanical, aeroelastic, wind, solar, radiofrequency, and pyroelectric mechanisms are discussed in this review article. To reduce the power consumption of the batteries, a vital role is played by power management integrated circuits (PMICs), which help to enhance the system&rsquo;s life span. Moreover, PMICs from different manufacturers that provide power management to IoT devices have been discussed in this paper. Furthermore, the energy harvesting networks can expose themselves to prominent security issues putting the secrecy of the system to risk. These possible attacks are also discussed in this review article.},
