  "abstract": "Let a finite set of interacting particles be given, together with a symmetry Lie group $G$. Here we describe all possible dynamics that are jointly equivariant with respect to the action of $G$. This is relevant e.g., when one aims to describe collective dynamics that are independent of any coordinate change or external influence. We particularize the results to some key examples, i.e. for the most basic low dimensional symmetries that appear in collective dynamics on manifolds.",
