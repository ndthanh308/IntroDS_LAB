A proof procedure for the predicate calculus is given that contains a few minor peculiar features. A fairly extensive discussion of the decision problem is given, including a partial solution of the (x) (Ey) (z) satis fiability case, an alternative procedure for the (x) (y) (Ez) case, and a rather detailed treatment of Skolem's case. In connection with the (x) (Ey) (z) case, an amusing combinatorial problem is suggested in Section 4.1. Some simple mathematical examples are considered in Section VI.",

pages="357--368",
abstract="In this paper we prove computable versions of Urysohn's lemma and the Tietze-Urysohn extension theorem for computable metric spaces. We use the TTE approach to computable analysis where objects are represented by finite or infinite sequences of symbols and computations transform sequences of symbols to sequences of symbols. The theorems hold for standard representations of the metric space, the set of real numbers, the set of closed subsets and the set of continuous functions. We show that there are computable procedures determining the continuous functions from the initial data (closed sets, continuous functions). The paper generalizes results by Yasugi, Mori and Tsujii in two ways: (1) The Tietze-Urysohn extension applies not only to ``strictly effectively $\sigma$-compact co-r.e.'' sets but to all co-r.e. closed sets. (2) Not only computable functions exist for computable sets and functions, respectively, but there are computable procedures which determine continuous functions from arbitrary closed sets and continuous functions, respectively. These procedures, however, are not extensional on the names under consideration, and so they induce merely multi-valued computable functions on the objects.",

abstract = "We describe Turing machines, tilings and infinite words as dynamical systems and analyze some of their dynamical properties. It is known that some of these systems do not always have periodic configurations; we prove that they always have quasi-periodic configurations and we quantify quasi-periodicity. We then study the decidability of dynamical properties for these systems. In analogy to Rice's theorem for computable functions, we derive a theorem that characterizes dynamical system properties that are undecidable. As an illustration of this result, we prove that topological entropy is undecidable for Turing machines and for tilings."
