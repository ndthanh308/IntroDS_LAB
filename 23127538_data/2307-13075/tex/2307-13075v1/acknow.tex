%I'd like to thank my writers, directors, producers, make-up artists.... \etc

I wish to thank my supervisors Dr. Paul Shafer and Prof. Michael Rathjen, both of whom have guided and inspired me along this journey. In particular, Dr. Shafer's regular engagement and inspiring passion for computability, logic, and mathematics, matched with his rigorous approach and choice quality coffee, has been one of the most profound privileges to work with. The generosity of time, expertise, and guidance from both of my supervisors has made this Ph.D. possible.

I am grateful to my colleagues and friends in the Logic Group at the University of Leeds for their support in answering questions and commenting on ideas, in particular:  Giovanni Solda, Emanuele Frittaion, Alberto Marcone, Marta Fiori Carones, John Truss, Stan Wainer, Andrew Brooke-Taylor, Charles Harris, Anton Freund, Martin Krombholz, Bjarki Geir Benediktsson, John Howe, Jakob Vidmar, Richard Matthews, Rosario Mennuni, James Gay, James Riley, Anja Komatar, Cong Chen, Richard Whyman, Sarah Sigley, Cesare Gallozzi, and Petra Staynova. Of note is Emanuele Frittaion, whose observation regarding Weihrauch degrees after a seminar I gave spawned the work in Chapter 5, and Andrew Brooke-Taylor for the references on Vop\v{e}nka's Principle in Chapter 4.

My thanks to the University of Leeds and the School of Mathematics for their hosting me, and to the EPSRC for their financial assistance. It has been gratefully received.

My thanks to my parents Pauline and Richard, my brother Edward, and my family - in particular my mum, who has lingered through several conversations I am certain she was not expecting to understand all of. My love and thanks to you all for supporting me in many ways.

I acknowledge the plentiful support of my friends and colleagues in the technology scene, including the participants at Leeds Hackspace, DC151, and DC11331, and the DEFCON and BSides family. I honour the marvellous work of the baristas of Leeds.

Lastly, my thanks to my first supervisor on this Ph.D., Prof. S. Barry Cooper, to whom this thesis is dedicated. Without you, Barry, I would not have been so encouraged and prepared to undertake this task in the beginning.

Cheers, Barry, and thank you, my friends.
