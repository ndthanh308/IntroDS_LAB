  "abstract": "Immunotherapy emerges as promising approach for treating cancer. Encouraging findings have validated the efficacy of immunotherapy medications in addressing tumors, resulting in prolonged survival rates and notable reductions in toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy methods. However, the pool of eligible patients for immunotherapy remains relatively small, indicating a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the physiological mechanisms responsible for favorable treatment response in certain individuals while others experience limited benefits. To tackle this issue, the authors present an innovative strategy that harnesses a non-linear cellular architecture in conjunction with a deep downstream classifier. This approach aims to carefully select and enhance 2D features extracted from chest-abdomen CT images, thereby improving the prediction of treatment outcomes. The proposed pipeline has been meticulously designed to seamlessly integrate with an advanced embedded Point of Care system. In this context, the authors present a compelling case study focused on Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma (mUC), a particularly aggressive form of cancer. Performance evaluation of the proposed approach underscores its effectiveness, with an impressive overall accuracy of approximately 93%",
