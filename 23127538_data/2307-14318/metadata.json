  "abstract": "In this paper we obtain results for the existence and uniqueness of solutions to coupled Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs) with jumps defined on a random environment. This environment corresponds to a measured-valued process, similar to the one found in Conditional McKean-Vlasov Differential Equations and Mean-Field Games with Common Noise. The jump term in the FBSDE is dependent on the environment through a stochastic intensity process. We provide examples which relate our model with FBSDEs driven by Cox and Hawkes processes, as well as regime-switching Conditional McKean-Vlasov differential equations.",
