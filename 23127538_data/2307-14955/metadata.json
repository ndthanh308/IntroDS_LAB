  "abstract": "In this article a description of the reduced phase space of the standard model coupled to gravity is given. For space or time-like boundaries this is achieved as the reduction of a symplectic space with respect to a coisotropic submanifold and with the BFV formalism. For light-like boundaries the reduced phase space is described as the reduction of a symplectic manifold with respect to a set of constraints. Some results about the Poisson brackets of sums of functionals are also proved.",
