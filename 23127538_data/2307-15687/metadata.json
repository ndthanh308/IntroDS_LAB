  "abstract": "Heavy and light quarks produced in high-$p_T$ partonic collisions radiate differently. Heavy quarks regenerate their color field, stripped-off in the hard reaction, much faster than the light ones and radiate a significantly smaller fraction of the initial quark energy. This peculiar feature of heavy-quark jets leads to a specific shape of the fragmentation functions observed in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. Differently from light flavors, the heavy quark fragmentation function strongly peaks at large fractional momentum $z$, i.e. the produced heavy-light mesons, $B$ or $D$, carry the main fraction of the jet momentum. This is a clear evidence of the dead-cone effect, and of a short production time of a heavy-light mesons. Contrary to propagation of a small $q\\bar q$ dipole, which survives in the medium due to color transparency, a heavy-light $Q\\bar q$ dipole promptly expands to a large size. Such a big dipole has no chance to remain intact in a dense medium produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions. On the other hand, a breakup of such a dipole does not affect much the production rate of $Q\\bar q$ mesons, differently from the case of light $q\\bar q$ meson production.",
