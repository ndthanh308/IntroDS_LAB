\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we shed light on the importance of adaptive segmentation and intelligent data selection in heavy hitter detection algorithms. We conducted various experiments to find the optimum adaptive segmentation scheme based on the computation and communication constraints. In addition to comparing different data selection schemes, we demonstrated the benefit of using a prefix list and deny list for improving the utility of $\ouralgorithm$. Moreover, $\ouralgorithm$ is designed to satisfy both local and aggregated differential privacy.
