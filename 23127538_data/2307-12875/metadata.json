  "abstract": "Mobile-phone advertising enables marketers to reach customers at a personal level and it enables the measure of costumers reaction by novel approaches, in real time, and at scale. By keeping a device anonymous, we can deliver custom adverts and we can check when the device owner will visit a specific mortar-and-brick location. This is the first step in a sale. By measuring visits and sales, the original marketers can determine their return on advertising and they can prove the efficacy of the marketing investments. We turn our attention to the measure of lift: we define it as the visit acceleration during the campaign flight with respect to a controlled baseline. We present a theoretical description; we describe a general and a simplified approach in composing the exposed and the control baseline; we develop two different vertical approaches with different comparable solutions; finally, we present how to carry the experiments and the measures for a few dozens campaigns; these campaigns range from hundred thousands devices and counting a few hundred visits to a handful locations, to sixty million devices and counting million visits to thousands locations. We care about experiments at scale.",
