\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusion}
The work presented here shows how the quantum singular transform can be used to calculate the Green's function in the Lehmann representation, given a sufficient polynomial approximation of the inverse function. In our noise-free simulations, we observe large errors when performing matrix inversion via QSVT, if the singular values of the matrix to invert fall outside the well-defined domain of the polynomial approximation of the inverse function. Our results indicate that care must be taken to ensure this doesn't happen. Equation \ref{eq:min_sig_value} offers a route to determining a proper approximation level; however, as discussed in the main text, this may require further approximations to evaluate. 

We show the metal insulator phase transition of the two-site Anderson model calculated for the Green's functions obtained from noise-free QSVT simulations (Figure \ref{fig:mott_k50}). For $k=50$ we find the absolute error from the true answer remains at the $10^{-12}$ level. For the $k=10$ result, where some of the singular values of the problem lie outside the domain where the polynomial approximation is correctly defined, we obtain much larger errors.

Finally, we described a new circuit strategy to implement the $\select$ oracle in the LCU technique. This uses ideas presented by Ralli \textit{et al.} in \cite{ralli2021implementation} and da Silva \textit{et al.} in \cite{da2022linear}. The overall circuit cost to perform a block encoding of any matrix supplied as a linear combination of Pauli operators scales as $O\big( |A|(\lceil \log_{2}(|A|) \rceil^{2}+n_{s}) \big)$ CNOT and single-qubit gates. Here $n_{s}$ is the number of system qubits and $|A|$ is the number of Pauli operators in the matrix defined in the LCU.

An interesting avenue for future work is to investigate whether ``phase gadgets'' can further improve the circuit cost of the $\select$ operator \cite{cowtan2019phase}. In detail, can ZX-calculus maximize gate cancellations between multicontrol Pauli gates in $U_{\select}$ implemented, according to the template outlined in Figure \ref{fig:cntrl_P_gate}?

% Future work will look into  building this LCU construction into the open-source PyTket compiler, so it can easily be utilised by the quantum computing community.
