% \caption{Single qubit quantum signal processing (QSP) circuit approximating $f(a) =1/a$. Each approximation is defined over the range $[-1,-\frac{1}{\kappa}]  \cup [\frac{1}{\kappa}, 1]$.  The top two plots take $a$ in the interval:  $ [-1,-\frac{1}{\kappa}]  \cup [\frac{1}{\kappa}, 1]$. The bottom two plots take $a$ in the interval: $ [-\frac{1}{\kappa}, 0)  \cup (0,\frac{1}{\kappa}]$. The degree of polynomial used to approximate $\kappa=50$ and $\kappa=10$ is $303$ and $1519$ respectively. The phases $\vec{\phi}$ to implement these functions via QSP are supplied in the Support Information.}
