\section{Mott Phase transition} \label{sec:mott_appendix}
This section summaries the Metal to insulator Mott phase transition results for different polynomial approximtions of the inverse funciton. The results are given in Figures \ref{fig:mott_k10} and \ref{fig:mott_k50_with_error}. For $k=10$ it should be noted that the error in the spectral function changes by many orders of magnitude compared. Whereas, the $k=50$ result remains around the pico level of accuracy at all points.
