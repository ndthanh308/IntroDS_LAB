abstract = {We identify a new cosmological problem for models which solve the strong CP puzzle with an invisible axion, unrelated to the domain wall problem. Because the axion is very weakly coupled, the energy density stored in the oscillations of the classical axion field does not dissipate rapidly; it exceeds the critical density needed to close the universe unless fa ⩽ 1012GeV, wherefa is the axion decay constant. If this bound is saturated, axions may comprise the dark matter of the universe.}

	journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
	abstract = {Recently there has been much interest in the spatial distribution of light scalar dark matter, especially axions, throughout the universe. When the local gravitational interactions between the scalar modes are sufficiently rapid, it can cause the field to re-organize into a BEC of gravitationally bound clumps. While these clumps are stable when only gravitation is included, the picture is complicated by the presence of the axion's attractive self-interactions, which can potentially cause the clumps to collapse. Here we perform a detailed stability analysis to determine under what conditions the clumps are stable. In this paper we focus on spherical configurations, leaving aspherical configurations for future work. We identify branches of clump solutions of the axion-gravity-self-interacting system and study their stability properties. We find that clumps that are (spatially) large are stable, while clumps that are (spatially) small are unstable and may collapse. Furthermore, there is a maximum number of particles that can be in a clump. We map out the full space of solutions, which includes quasi-stable axitons, and clarify how a recent claim in the literature of a new ultra-dense branch of stable solutions rests on an invalid use of the non-relativistic approximation. We also consider repulsive self-interactions that may arise from a generic scalar dark matter candidate, finding a single stable branch that extends to arbitrary particle number.}

We delineate different qualitative behaviour of the photon luminosity in terms of an effective dimensionless coupling parameter constructed out of the axion-photon coupling, and field amplitude, oscillation frequency and radius of the axion star. For small values of this dimensionless coupling, we provide a general analytic formula for the dipole radiation field and the photon luminosity per solid angle, including a strong dependence on the radius of the configuration. For moderate to large coupling, we report on a non-monotonic behavior of the luminosity with the coupling strength in the presence of external magnetic fields. After an initial rise in luminosity with the coupling strength, we see a suppression (by an order of magnitude or more compared to the dipole radiation approximation) at moderately large coupling. At sufficiently large coupling, we find a transition to a regime of exponential growth of the luminosity due to parametric resonance. We carry out 3+1 dimensional lattice simulations of axion electrodynamics, at small and large coupling, including non-perturbative effects of parametric resonance as well as backreaction effects when necessary. We also discuss medium (plasma) effects that lead to resonant axion to photon conversion, relevance of the coherence of the soliton, and implications of our results in astrophysical and cosmological settings.},

abstract = {Axion stars are hypothetical objects formed of axions, obtained as localized and coherently oscillating solutions to their classical equation of motion. Depending on the value of the field amplitude at the core |θ0|≡|θ(r=0)|, the equilibrium of the system arises from the balance of the kinetic pressure and either self-gravity or axion self-interactions. Starting from a general relativistic framework, we obtain the set of equations describing the configuration of the axion star, which we solve as a function of |θ0|. For small |θ0|≲1, we reproduce results previously obtained in the literature, and we provide arguments for the stability of such configurations in terms of first principles. We compare qualitative analytical results with a numerical calculation. For large amplitudes |θ0|≳1, the axion field probes the full non-harmonic QCD chiral potential and the axion star enters the dense branch. Our numerical solutions show that in this latter regime the axions are relativistic, and that one should not use a single frequency approximation, as previously applied in the literature. We employ a multi-harmonic expansion to solve the relativistic equation for the axion field in the star, and demonstrate that higher modes cannot be neglected in the dense regime. We interpret the solutions in the dense regime as pseudo-breathers, and show that the life-time of such configurations is much smaller than any cosmological time scale.}

Before their eventual demise, oscillons can pass through (one or more) exceptionally stable field configurations where their decay rate is highly suppressed. We provide an improved calculation of the non-trivial behavior of the decay rates, and lifetimes of oscillons. In particular, our calculation correctly captures the existence (or absence) of the exceptionally long-lived states for large amplitude oscillons in a broad class of potentials, including non-polynomial potentials that flatten at large field values. The key underlying reason for the improved (by many orders of magnitude in some cases) calculation is the systematic inclusion of a spacetime-dependent effective mass term in the equation describing the radiation emitted by oscillons (in addition to a source term). Our results for the exceptionally stable configurations, decay rates, and lifetime of large amplitude oscillons (in some cases ≳ 108 oscillations) in such flattened potentials might be relevant for cosmological applications.}

	abstract = {Oscillons are bound states sustained by self-interactions that appear in rather generic scalar models. They can be extremely long-lived and have a built-in formation mechanism—parametric resonance instability. These features suggest that oscillons can affect the standard picture of scalar ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) models. We explore this idea along two directions. First, we investigate numerically oscillon lifetimes and their dependence on the shape of the potential. We find that scalar potentials that occur in well motivated axion-like models can lead to oscillons that live up to 108 cycles or more. Second, we discuss the observational constraints on the ULDM models once the presence of oscillons is taken into account. For a wide range of axion masses, oscillons decay around or after matter-radiation equality and can thus act as early seeds for structure formation. We also discuss the possibility that oscillons survive up to today. In this case they can most easily play the role of dark matter.}

abstract = {The principles of space-based low-frequency radio astronomy (below 50 MHz) are briefly introduced. As the wavelength range considered does not allow the use of focusing systems, goniopolarimetric (or direction-finding) techniques have been developed. These inversion techniques provide the direction of the wave vector, the polarization state and the flux of the observed electromagnetic wave. In case of spatially extended sources, we can also infer an order of magnitude of the apparent source size. These techniques are presented, and their limitations are discussed. An example from a recent study illustrates the techniques and capabilities.
Résumé
La radioastronomie basse fréquence (en dessous de 50 MHz) couvre principalement l'étude des émissions radio planétaires et solaires. Comme la gamme de longueur d'onde considérée ne permet pas l'utilisation de systèmes focalisants, les techniques d'inversion goniopolarimétrique ont été développées. Ces inversions fournissent la direction du vecteur d'onde, l'état de polarisation et la densité spectrale de puissance d'une onde électromagnétique observée. Dans le cas de sources radio spatialement étendues, on peut aussi obtenir l'ordre de grandeur de la taille apparente de la source. Ces techniques sont présentées, ainsi que leurs limitations. Un exemple tiré d'une étude récente illustre ces techniques.}
