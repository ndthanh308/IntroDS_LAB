  "abstract": "In this paper we examine the possibility of dilute axion stars converting to photons in the weak, large-scale magnetic field of the Milky Way and show that they can resonate with the surrounding plasma and produce a sizable signal. We consider two possibilities for the plasma: free electrons and HII regions. In the former case, we argue that the frequency of the photons will be too small to be observed even by space-based radio telescopes. In the latter case, their frequency is larger, safely above the solar wind cut-off. We provide an estimate of the flux as a function of the decay constant and show that for $f_{a} < 5 \\times 10^{11} \\text{GeV}$, the signal will be above the radio emission of the solar system's planets and it could potentially be detected by the NCLE instrument which is on board the Chang'e-4 spacecraft. Finally, we calculate the time scale of decay of the axion star and demonstrate that back-reaction can be neglected for all physically interesting values of the decay constant, while the minimum time scale of decay is in the order of a few hours.",
