  "abstract": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity. The weakly zero-divisor graph $WΓ(R)$ of the ring $R$ is the simple undirected graph whose vertices are nonzero zero-divisors of $R$ and two vertices $x$, $y$ are adjacent if and only if there exists $r\\in {\\rm ann}(x)$ and $s \\in {\\rm ann}(y)$ such that $rs =0$. The zero-divisor graph of a ring is a spanning subgraph of the weakly zero-divisor graph. It is known that the zero-divisor graph of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{p^t}$, where $p$ is a prime, is the Laplacian integral. In this paper, we obtain the Laplacian spectrum of the weakly zero-divisor graph $WΓ(\\mathbb{Z}_{n})$ of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and show that $WΓ(\\mathbb{Z}_{n})$ is Laplacian integral for arbitrary $n$.",
