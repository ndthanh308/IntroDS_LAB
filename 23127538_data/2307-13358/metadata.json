  "abstract": "We explain how to attach a coalgebra $\\mathcal C$ over a field $k$ to a small $k$-linear category $\\mathsf E$ satisfying suitable finiteness conditions. In this context, we study full-and-faithfulness of the contramodule forgetful functor, and describe explicitly the categories of locally finite left $\\mathcal C$-comodules and left $\\mathcal C$-contramodules as certain full subcategories of the category of left $\\mathsf E$-modules.",
