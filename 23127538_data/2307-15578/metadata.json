  "abstract": "For family $x'=(a_0+a_1\\cos t+a_2 \\sin t)|x|+b_0+b_1 \\cos t+b_2 \\sin t$, we solve three basic problems related with its dynamics. First, we characterize when it has a center (Poincaré center focus problem). Second, we show that each equation has a finite number of limit cycles (finiteness problem), and finally we give a uniform upper bound for the number of limit cycles (Hilbert's 16th problem).",
