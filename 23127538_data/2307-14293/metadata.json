  "abstract": "Boundaries between structural twins of bilayer graphene (so-called AB/BA domain walls) are often discussed in terms of the formation of topologically protected valley-polarised chiral states. Here, we show that, depending on the width of the AB/BA boundary, the latter can also support non-chiral one-dimensional (1D) states that are confined to the domain wall at low energies and take the form of quasi-bound states at higher energies, where the 1D bands cross into the two-dimensional spectral continuum. We present the results of modeling of electronic properties of AB/BA domain walls with and without magnetic field as a function of their width and interlayer bias.",
