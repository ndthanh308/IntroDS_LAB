\noindent We have presented a novel method for simultaneous temperature estimation and non uniformity correction in IR imaging, based on a DL that incorporates the physical model of the sensor. 
The method uses redundant information between multiple overlapping frames to infer the scene temperature and correct non-uniformity, without requiring any calibration or external reference. 
The method also exploits prior knowledge of the camera ambient temperature, which is measured by a built-in sensor, to improve the accuracy and robustness of the estimation.

We have evaluated the performance of the method on synthetic and real data and compared it with existing methods. 
The results show that the method can achieve high accuracy and low error, and can handle various scenarios, such as changing ambient temperature, moving objects, and complex backgrounds.

We showed that performance improve with the number of frames, showing the benefits of exploiting the redundant information between frames.
The training process introduced misalignments between frames, which were handled by the method and did not affect the performance.
The method can also generalize well to different camera models and settings and can be easily adapted to different applications. This was demonstrated by real data collected with a different camera mounted on a UAV\@. The MAE error with the real UAV data were $0.27^\circ C-0.54^\circ C$, which is comparable to the accuracy of scientific-grade cameras.

The method offers a simple and effective solution for improving the quality and reliability of low-cost uncooled infrared imaging and can potentially enable new applications that require accurate and consistent temperature measurements.
