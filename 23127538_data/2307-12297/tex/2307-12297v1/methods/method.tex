\noindent The proposed method simultaneously estimates the scene temperature and corrects nonuniformity from a burst of consecutive frames.

An overview of the method is presented in \cref{fig:process}. 
The IR camera captures overlapping gray-level frames. 
A burst of consecutive gray-level frames are registered towards $\mathcal{I}$, the pivot frame that has the maximal overlap to all other frames.
The registered gray-level frames are the input to the network, along with the ambient temperature.
The output of the network is a 2D map of the estimated scene temperatures.
