\noindent Estimating the temperature can be broadly divided into two parts - transforming the output of the camera to temperatures, and correcting nonuniformity in the sensor.
Finding a transformation between camera output to temperature is called \emph{thermal calibration}. Correcting the nonuniformity in the sensor is called \emph{nonuniformity correction}~(NUC).

A method based on neural networks to simultaneously estimate the scene temperature and correct the nonuniformity using multiframes information has not been achieved yet.

The study builds on the image acquisition model, which describes the relationship between the observed scene and the output of the camera (\cref{sec:background:imageAcquasition}).
By leveraging redundant information across multiple frames and ambient temperature data, the study develops a kernel estimation network (KPN) that uses DL techniques to estimate the temperature of each pixel (\cref{sec:methods:net}).

The efficacy of the method is demonstrated through tests on real measurements obtained using an uncooled IR camera with those from a scientific radiometric camera. These tests illustrate the ability of the method to correct for nonuniformity and estimate temperatures accurately across different cameras (\cref{sec:results:realdata}).

Our main contributions are: (i) we exploit the redundant information between frames to simultaneously estimate the scene temperature and correct the nonuniformity using a deep neural network; (ii) we impose the physical model of the camera as a constraint on the network to enhance the temperature estimation accuracy; (iii) we incorporate the ambient temperature data as an additional input to the network to further improve the accuracy of the temperature estimation; and (iv) we demonstrate the advantages of using multiple frames over single-frame methods through extensive experiments on synthetic and real data.
