\noindent The estimation of temperature can be broadly divided into two parts: transforming the output of the camera to temperatures, and correcting nonuniformity in the sensor.
Determining the transformation from camera output to temperature is called \emph{thermal calibration}. Correcting the nonuniformity in the sensor is called \emph{nonuniformity correction}~(NUC).

A NN-based method to simultaneously estimate the scene temperature and correct the nonuniformity using multiframe information has not yet been achieved.

The present study builds on the image-acquisition model, which describes the relationship between the observed scene and the output of the camera (\cref{sec:background:imageAcquasition}).
By leveraging redundant information across multiple frames and ambient temperature data, the study develops a kernel prediction network (KPN) that uses DL techniques to estimate the temperature of each pixel (\cref{sec:methods:net}).

The efficacy of the method is demonstrated through comparisons of real measurements obtained with an uncooled \ir camera and those from a scientific radiometric camera.
These tests illustrate the method's ability to correct for nonuniformity and estimate temperatures accurately across different cameras (\cref{sec:results:realdata}).

Our main contributions consist of: (1) exploiting the redundant information between frames to simultaneously estimate the scene temperature and correct the nonuniformity using a NN; (2) imposing the physical model of the camera as a constraint on the network to enhance the temperature-estimation accuracy; (3) incorporating the ambient temperature data as an additional input to the network to further improve the accuracy of the temperature estimation; and (4) demonstrating the advantages of using multiple frames over single-frame methods through extensive experiments on synthetic and real data.
