  "abstract": "For the first Painlevé transcendents Kitaev established an asymptotic representation in terms of the Weierstrass pe-function in cheese-like strips near the point at infinity. We present an explicit error bound of this asymptotic expression, which leads to the order estimate of exponent $-1$.",
