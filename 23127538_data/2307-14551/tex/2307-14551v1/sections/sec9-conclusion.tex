\section{Conclusion}

With these results we conclude that different strategies to remove unwanted content on the YouTube platform work to different degrees, and from our tested strategies we found that using the ``Not interested" button was a clear winner. However, this strategy has not seen widespread adoption among users. That is, while those who know about these effective buttons get to experience their effective behavior, 44\% of adult YouTube users in the US are not aware that they exist. Thus, we join existing calls for YouTube to amplify more broadly the effective ways to remove unwanted recommendations on its platform.
