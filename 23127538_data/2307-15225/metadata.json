  "abstract": "Cyberbullying has become a pervasive issue based on the rise of cell phones and internet usage affecting individuals worldwide. This paper proposes an open-source intelligence pipeline using data from Twitter to track keywords relevant to cyberbullying in social media to build dashboards for law enforcement agents. We discuss the prevalence of cyberbullying on social media, factors that compel individuals to indulge in cyberbullying, and the legal implications of cyberbullying in different countries also highlight the lack of direction, resources, training, and support that law enforcement officers face in investigating cyberbullying cases. The proposed interventions for cyberbullying involve collective efforts from various stakeholders, including parents, law enforcement, social media platforms, educational institutions, educators, and researchers. Our research provides a framework for cyberbullying and provides a comprehensive view of the digital landscape for investigators to track and identify cyberbullies, their tactics, and patterns. An OSINT dashboard with real-time monitoring empowers law enforcement to swiftly take action, protect victims, and make significant strides toward creating a safer online environment.",
