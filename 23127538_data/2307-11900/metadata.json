  "abstract": "We present a function which connects the parameter of a previously published short sequence of selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) and displacement gates acting on a qudit encoded into the Fock states of a superconducting cavity, $V_k(α)=D(α)R_π(k)D(-2α)R_π(k)D(α)$ to the angle of the Givens rotation $G(θ)$ on levels $|k\\rangle,|k+1\\rangle$ that sequence approximates, namely $α=Φ(θ) = \\fracθ{4\\sqrt{k+1}}$. Previous publications left the determination of an appropriate $α$ to numerical optimization at compile time. The map $Φ$ gives us the ability to compile directly any $d$-dimensional unitary into a sequence of SNAP and displacement gates in $O(d^3)$ complex floating point operations with low constant prefactor, avoiding the need for numerical optimization. Numerical studies demonstrate that the infidelity of the generated gate sequence $V_k$ per Givens rotation $G$ scales as approximately $O(θ^6)$. We find numerically that the error on compiled circuits can be made arbitrarily small by breaking each rotation into $m$ $θ/m$ rotations, with the full $d\\times d$ unitary infidelity scaling as approximately $O(m^{-4})$. This represents a significant reduction in the computational effort to compile qudit unitaries either to SNAP and displacement gates or to generate them via direct low-level pulse optimization via optimal control.",
