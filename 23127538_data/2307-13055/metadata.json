  "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization for unsupervised learning methods on graph data. This scenario is particularly challenging because graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be sensitive to distributional shifts, even when labels are available. To address this challenge, we propose a \\underline{M}odel-\\underline{A}gnostic \\underline{R}ecipe for \\underline{I}mproving \\underline{O}OD generalizability of unsupervised graph contrastive learning methods, which we refer to as MARIO. MARIO introduces two principles aimed at developing distributional-shift-robust graph contrastive methods to overcome the limitations of existing frameworks: (i) Information Bottleneck (IB) principle for achieving generalizable representations and (ii) Invariant principle that incorporates adversarial data augmentation to obtain invariant representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates the OOD generalization problem of graph contrastive learning, with a specific focus on node-level tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OOD test set, while maintaining comparable performance on the in-distribution test set when compared to existing approaches.
