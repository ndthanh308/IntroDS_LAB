While statistical modelling typically focuses on the eventual choice, we analyze consideration sets describing, for each survey participant, all options between which the respondent is pondering. Using a German pre-election poll as a prototypical example, we give a proof of concept that consideration set sampling is easy to implement and provides the basis for an insightful structural analysis of the respondents' positions. The set-valued observations forming the consideration sets are naturally modelled as random sets, allowing to transfer regression modelling as",
