  "abstract": "We investigate the nature of quantum criticality and topological phase transitions near the critical lines obtained for the extended Kitaev chain with next nearest neighbor hopping parameters and non-Hermitian chemical potential. We surprisingly find multiple gap-less points, the locations of which in the momentum space can change along the critical line unlike the Hermitian counterpart. The interesting simultaneous occurrences of vanishing and sign flipping behavior by real and imaginary components, respectively of the lowest excitation is observed near the topological phase transition. Introduction of non- Hermitian factor leads to an isolated critical point instead of a critical line and hence, reduced number of multi-critical points as compared to the Hermitian case. The critical exponents obtained for the multi-critical and critical points show a very distinct behavior from the Hermitian case.",
