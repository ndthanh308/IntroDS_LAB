  "abstract": "The importance of nonlocality of mean scalar transport in 2D Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) is investigated. The Macroscopic Forcing Method (MFM) is utilized to measure spatio-temporal moments of the eddy diffusivity kernel representing passive scalar transport in the ensemble averaged fields. Presented in this work are several studies assessing the importance of the higher-order moments of the eddy diffusivity, which contain information about nonlocality, in models for RTI. First, it is demonstrated through a comparison of leading-order models that a purely local eddy diffusivity is insufficient in capturing the mean field evolution of the mass fraction in RTI. Therefore, higher-order moments of the eddy diffusivity operator are not negligible. Models are then constructed by utilizing the measured higher-order moments. It is demonstrated that an explicit operator based on the Kramers-Moyal expansion of the eddy diffusivity kernel is insufficient. An implicit operator construction that matches the measured moments is shown to offer improvements relative to the local model in a converging fashion.",
