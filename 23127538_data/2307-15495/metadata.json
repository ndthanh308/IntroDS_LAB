  "abstract": "We study the spectral properties of two classes of random matrix models: non-Gaussian RMT with quartic and sextic potentials, and RMT with Gaussian noise. We compute and analyze the quantum Krylov complexity and the spectral form factor for both of these models. We find that both models show suppression of the spectral form factor at short times due to decoherence effects, but they differ in their long-time behavior. In particular, we show that the Krylov complexity for the non-Gaussian RMT and RMT with noise deviates from that of a Gaussian RMT. We discuss the implications and limitations of our results for quantum chaos and quantum information in open quantum systems. Our study reveals the distinct sensitivities of the spectral form factor and complexity to non-Gaussianity and noise, which contribute to the observed differences in the different time domains.",
