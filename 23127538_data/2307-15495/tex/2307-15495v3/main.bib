abstract = {Controllable, coherent many-body systems can provide insights into the fundamental properties of quantum matter, enable the realization of new quantum phases and could ultimately lead to computational systems that outperform existing computers based on classical approaches. Here we demonstrate a method for creating controlled many-body quantum matter that combines deterministically prepared, reconfigurable arrays of individually trapped cold atoms with strong, coherent interactions enabled by excitation to Rydberg states. We realize a programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable interactions and system sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe phase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase boundary. Our method provides a way of exploring many-body phenomena on a programmable quantum simulator and could enable realizations of new quantum algorithms.},

This paper deduces from the same theoretical model the statistical behavior to be expected for a finite stretch of observed eigenvalues chosen out of a much longer stretch of unobserved ones. In comparing the model with experimental data, we have always to deal with such a finite stretch of observed levels. Three ``statistics'' are investigated; these are quantities which can be computed directly from the observed data, and for which the expectation values and statistical variances can be calculated from the theory. One statistic gives only a precise way of measuring the average level spacing. One provides a test of the model by measuring the degree of long‐range order in the level series. The third provides an independent test of the model by measuring the degree of short‐range order. In Sec. V these methods are applied to a preliminary analysis of some experimental data on neutron capture levels in heavy nuclei. The results are inconclusive. Discrepancies between theory and observation are large, but the discrepancies might be produced either by incompleteness of the data or by incorrectness of the theoretical model.}",

abstract = {The theory of scarring of eigenfunctions of classically chaotic systems by short periodic orbits is extended in several ways. The influence of short-time linear recurrences on correlations and fluctuations at long times is emphasized. We include the contribution to scarring of nonlinear recurrences associated with homoclinic orbits and treat the different scenarios of random and nonrandom long-time recurrences. The importance of the local classical structure around the periodic orbit is emphasized, and it is shown for an optimal choice of test basis in phase space that scars must persist in the semiclassical limit. The crucial role of symmetry is also discussed which, together with the nonlinear recurrences gives a much improved account of the actual strength of scars for given classical orbits and in individual wave- functions. Quantitative measures of scarring are provided and comparisons are made with numerical data.}

abstract = {We study aspects of chaos and thermodynamics at strong coupling in a scalar model using LCT numerical methods. We find that our eigenstate spectrum satisfies Wigner-Dyson statistics and that the coefficients describing eigenstates in our basis satisfy Random Matrix Theory (RMT) statistics. At weak coupling, though the bulk of states satisfy RMT statistics, we find several scar states as well. We then use these chaotic states to compute the equation of state of the model, obtaining results consistent with Conformal Field Theory (CFT) expectations at temperatures above the scale of relevant interactions. We also test the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis by computing the expectation value of local operators in eigenstates, and check that their behavior is consistent with thermal CFT values at high temperatures. Finally, we compute the Spectral Form Factor (SFF), which has the expected behavior associated with the equation of state at short times and chaos at long times. We also propose a new technique for extracting the connected part of the SFF without the need of disorder averaging by using different symmetry sectors.},

The Krylov complexity naturally describes the "size" of the distribution, while the higher cumulants encode richer information. We further consider the double-scaled limit of SYK$_q$ at infinite temperature, where $q \sim \sqrt{N}$. In such a limit, we find that the scrambling time shrinks to zero, and the Lanczos coefficients diverge. The growth of Krylov complexity appears to be "hyperfast", which is previously conjectured to be associated with scrambling in de Sitter space.},

With the observation that all three quantities may be obtained by different analytic continuations of the torus partition function, we address the connections and distinctions between the information that each quantity provides us. In this process, we study the emergence of irrationality from “large-N” limits of rational conformal field theories (RCFTs) as well as the explicit breakdown of rationality for theories with central charges greater than the number of their conserved currents. Our analysis begins to elucidate the intermediate dynamical behavior of theories that bridge the gap between integrable RCFTs and maximally chaotic holographic CFTs.},

We provide a brief introduction to quantum thermalization, paying particular attention to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and the resulting single-eigenstate statistical mechanics. We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden. }

@article{ODea2020,
abstract = {We present a general symmetry-based framework for obtaining many-body Hamiltonians with scarred eigenstates that do not obey the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Our models are derived from parent Hamiltonians with a non-Abelian (or q-deformed) symmetry, whose eigenspectra are organized as degenerate multiplets that transform as irreducible representations of the symmetry ("tunnels"). We show that large classes of perturbations break the symmetry, but in a manner that preserves a particular low-entanglement multiplet of states, thereby giving generic, thermal spectra with a shadow of the broken symmetry in the form of scars. The generators of the Lie algebra furnish operators with "spectrum-generating algebras"that can be used to lift the degeneracy of the scar states and promote them to equally spaced "towers."Our framework applies to several known models with scars, but we also introduce models with scars that transform as irreducible representations of symmetries such as SU(3) and q-deformed SU(2), significantly generalizing the types of systems known to harbor this phenomenon. Additionally, we present examples of generalized Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) models with scar states that do not transform in an irreducible representation of the relevant symmetry. These are derived from parent Hamiltonians with enhanced symmetries, and bring AKLT-Type models into our framework.},

    abstract = { Weakly interacting quasiparticles play a central role in the low-energy description of many phases of quantum matter. At higher energies, however, quasiparticles cease to be well defined in generic many-body systems owing to a proliferation of decay channels. In this review, we discuss the phenomenon of quantum many-body scars, which can give rise to certain species of stable quasiparticles throughout the energy spectrum. This goes along with a set of unusual nonequilibrium phenomena including many-body revivals and nonthermal stationary states. We provide a pedagogical exposition of this physics via a simple yet comprehensive example, that of a spin-1 XY model. We place our discussion in the broader context of symmetry-based constructions of many-body scar states, projector embeddings, and Hilbert space fragmentation. We conclude with a summary of experimental progress and theoretical puzzles. }

@article{Turner2018,
abstract = {The thermodynamic description of many-particle systems rests on the assumption of ergodicity, the ability of a system to explore all allowed configurations in the phase space. Recent studies on many-body localization have revealed the existence of systems that strongly violate ergodicity in the presence of quenched disorder. Here, we demonstrate that ergodicity can be weakly broken by a different mechanism, arising from the presence of special eigenstates in the many-body spectrum that are reminiscent of quantum scars in chaotic non-interacting systems. In the single-particle case, quantum scars correspond to wavefunctions that concentrate in the vicinity of unstable periodic classical trajectories. We show that many-body scars appear in the Fibonacci chain, a model with a constrained local Hilbert space that has recently been experimentally realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator. The quantum scarred eigenstates are embedded throughout the otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum but lead to direct experimental signatures, as we show for periodic recurrences that reproduce those observed in the experiment. Our results suggest that scarred many-body bands give rise to a new universality class of quantum dynamics, opening up opportunities for the creation of novel states with long-lived coherence in systems that are now experimentally realizable.},

abstract = {The X-Y model of a linear chain of spins 12, introduced by Lieb, Schultz and Mattis, is studied in the presence of a magnetic field h along the z axis. In section A the Hamiltonian is diagolalized in terms of fermion operators. In section B the magnetization along the z axis is calculated for arbitrary field and temperature. We find that there is no spontaneous magnetization and that only at zero temperature there is a phase transition of the second kind, the magnetic susceptibility being of the form c·In|h — hc| in the neighborhood of a critical field hc. In section C we derive an expression for the time-dependent correlation function ϱzR(β, t) of the z-components of spins separated by an arbitrary number R of lattice sites. Starting from this expression we will show that there is no long-range order of the z components of the spins in the absence of the field and that in the presence of a field the long-range order corresponds with the magnetization. Furthermore we discuss the time-dependent autocorrelation function of the z component of one single spin, of the total magnetization of the chain, and the possibility that Im ϱzR(β, t) satisfies a kind of wave equation, for this special case, as has been proposed by Ruygrok for more general cases. In section D the isolated chain is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium in a certain magnetic field, after which the field is suddenly changed by an arbitrary amount, and an exact expression is derived for the temporal development of the z component of the magnetization, which is found to reach an equilibrium value as time goes to infinity. In section E this exact time development is compared with the exact solution of the Kubo formalism and it is proved analytically that the Kubo formula holds for high temperatures and small perturbation, but some numerical calculations show that the development into powers of the perturbation converge very slowly. We conclude with a short discussion of the approach of Mazur and Terwiel to the relaxation of more general spin systems, in connection with our exact results on the chain.}

abstract = {The X-Y model of a linear chain of spins 12, introduced by Lieb, Schultz and Mattis, is studied in the presence of a magnetic field h along the z axis. In section A the Hamiltonian is diagolalized in terms of fermion operators. In section B the magnetization along the z axis is calculated for arbitrary field and temperature. We find that there is no spontaneous magnetization and that only at zero temperature there is a phase transition of the second kind, the magnetic susceptibility being of the form c·In|h — hc| in the neighborhood of a critical field hc. In section C we derive an expression for the time-dependent correlation function ϱzR(β, t) of the z-components of spins separated by an arbitrary number R of lattice sites. Starting from this expression we will show that there is no long-range order of the z components of the spins in the absence of the field and that in the presence of a field the long-range order corresponds with the magnetization. Furthermore we discuss the time-dependent autocorrelation function of the z component of one single spin, of the total magnetization of the chain, and the possibility that Im ϱzR(β, t) satisfies a kind of wave equation, for this special case, as has been proposed by Ruygrok for more general cases. In section D the isolated chain is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium in a certain magnetic field, after which the field is suddenly changed by an arbitrary amount, and an exact expression is derived for the temporal development of the z component of the magnetization, which is found to reach an equilibrium value as time goes to infinity. In section E this exact time development is compared with the exact solution of the Kubo formalism and it is proved analytically that the Kubo formula holds for high temperatures and small perturbation, but some numerical calculations show that the development into powers of the perturbation converge very slowly. We conclude with a short discussion of the approach of Mazur and Terwiel to the relaxation of more general spin systems, in connection with our exact results on the chain.}

abstract = {The X-Y model of a linear chain of spins 12, introduced by Lieb, Schultz and Mattis, is studied in the presence of a magnetic field h along the z axis. In section A the Hamiltonian is diagolalized in terms of fermion operators. In section B the magnetization along the z axis is calculated for arbitrary field and temperature. We find that there is no spontaneous magnetization and that only at zero temperature there is a phase transition of the second kind, the magnetic susceptibility being of the form c·In|h — hc| in the neighborhood of a critical field hc. In section C we derive an expression for the time-dependent correlation function ϱzR(β, t) of the z-components of spins separated by an arbitrary number R of lattice sites. Starting from this expression we will show that there is no long-range order of the z components of the spins in the absence of the field and that in the presence of a field the long-range order corresponds with the magnetization. Furthermore we discuss the time-dependent autocorrelation function of the z component of one single spin, of the total magnetization of the chain, and the possibility that Im ϱzR(β, t) satisfies a kind of wave equation, for this special case, as has been proposed by Ruygrok for more general cases. In section D the isolated chain is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium in a certain magnetic field, after which the field is suddenly changed by an arbitrary amount, and an exact expression is derived for the temporal development of the z component of the magnetization, which is found to reach an equilibrium value as time goes to infinity. In section E this exact time development is compared with the exact solution of the Kubo formalism and it is proved analytically that the Kubo formula holds for high temperatures and small perturbation, but some numerical calculations show that the development into powers of the perturbation converge very slowly. We conclude with a short discussion of the approach of Mazur and Terwiel to the relaxation of more general spin systems, in connection with our exact results on the chain.}

For completely general commutation relations between X and Y, (the free Lie algebra), the general result is somewhat unwieldy. However in specific physics applications the commutator , while non-zero, might often be relatively simple, which sometimes leads to explicit closed form results. We consider the special case , and show that in this case the general result reduces to Furthermore we explicitly evaluate the symmetric function , demonstrating that and relate this to previously known results. For instance this result includes, but is considerably more general than, results obtained from either the Heisenberg commutator or the creation-destruction commutator .}

abstract = {Controllable, coherent many-body systems can provide insights into the fundamental properties of quantum matter, enable the realization of new quantum phases and could ultimately lead to computational systems that outperform existing computers based on classical approaches. Here we demonstrate a method for creating controlled many-body quantum matter that combines deterministically prepared, reconfigurable arrays of individually trapped cold atoms with strong, coherent interactions enabled by excitation to Rydberg states. We realize a programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable interactions and system sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe phase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase boundary. Our method provides a way of exploring many-body phenomena on a programmable quantum simulator and could enable realizations of new quantum algorithms.},

abstract = {The theory of scarring of eigenfunctions of classically chaotic systems by short periodic orbits is extended in several ways. The influence of short-time linear recurrences on correlations and fluctuations at long times is emphasized. We include the contribution to scarring of nonlinear recurrences associated with homoclinic orbits and treat the different scenarios of random and nonrandom long-time recurrences. The importance of the local classical structure around the periodic orbit is emphasized, and it is shown for an optimal choice of test basis in phase space that scars must persist in the semiclassical limit. The crucial role of symmetry is also discussed which, together with the nonlinear recurrences gives a much improved account of the actual strength of scars for given classical orbits and in individual wave- functions. Quantitative measures of scarring are provided and comparisons are made with numerical data.}

@article{Delacretaz2023,
abstract = {We study aspects of chaos and thermodynamics at strong coupling in a scalar model using LCT numerical methods. We find that our eigenstate spectrum satisfies Wigner-Dyson statistics and that the coefficients describing eigenstates in our basis satisfy Random Matrix Theory (RMT) statistics. At weak coupling, though the bulk of states satisfy RMT statistics, we find several scar states as well. We then use these chaotic states to compute the equation of state of the model, obtaining results consistent with Conformal Field Theory (CFT) expectations at temperatures above the scale of relevant interactions. We also test the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis by computing the expectation value of local operators in eigenstates, and check that their behavior is consistent with thermal CFT values at high temperatures. Finally, we compute the Spectral Form Factor (SFF), which has the expected behavior associated with the equation of state at short times and chaos at long times. We also propose a new technique for extracting the connected part of the SFF without the need of disorder averaging by using different symmetry sectors.},

With the observation that all three quantities may be obtained by different analytic continuations of the torus partition function, we address the connections and distinctions between the information that each quantity provides us. In this process, we study the emergence of irrationality from “large-N” limits of rational conformal field theories (RCFTs) as well as the explicit breakdown of rationality for theories with central charges greater than the number of their conserved currents. Our analysis begins to elucidate the intermediate dynamical behavior of theories that bridge the gap between integrable RCFTs and maximally chaotic holographic CFTs.},

    abstract = { We review some recent developments in the statistical mechanics of isolated quantum systems. We provide a brief introduction to quantum thermalization, paying particular attention to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and the resulting single-eigenstate statistical mechanics. We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden. }

@article{ODea2020,
abstract = {We present a general symmetry-based framework for obtaining many-body Hamiltonians with scarred eigenstates that do not obey the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Our models are derived from parent Hamiltonians with a non-Abelian (or q-deformed) symmetry, whose eigenspectra are organized as degenerate multiplets that transform as irreducible representations of the symmetry ("tunnels"). We show that large classes of perturbations break the symmetry, but in a manner that preserves a particular low-entanglement multiplet of states, thereby giving generic, thermal spectra with a shadow of the broken symmetry in the form of scars. The generators of the Lie algebra furnish operators with "spectrum-generating algebras"that can be used to lift the degeneracy of the scar states and promote them to equally spaced "towers."Our framework applies to several known models with scars, but we also introduce models with scars that transform as irreducible representations of symmetries such as SU(3) and q-deformed SU(2), significantly generalizing the types of systems known to harbor this phenomenon. Additionally, we present examples of generalized Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) models with scar states that do not transform in an irreducible representation of the relevant symmetry. These are derived from parent Hamiltonians with enhanced symmetries, and bring AKLT-Type models into our framework.},

    abstract = { Weakly interacting quasiparticles play a central role in the low-energy description of many phases of quantum matter. At higher energies, however, quasiparticles cease to be well defined in generic many-body systems owing to a proliferation of decay channels. In this review, we discuss the phenomenon of quantum many-body scars, which can give rise to certain species of stable quasiparticles throughout the energy spectrum. This goes along with a set of unusual nonequilibrium phenomena including many-body revivals and nonthermal stationary states. We provide a pedagogical exposition of this physics via a simple yet comprehensive example, that of a spin-1 XY model. We place our discussion in the broader context of symmetry-based constructions of many-body scar states, projector embeddings, and Hilbert space fragmentation. We conclude with a summary of experimental progress and theoretical puzzles. }

@article{Turner2018,
abstract = {The thermodynamic description of many-particle systems rests on the assumption of ergodicity, the ability of a system to explore all allowed configurations in the phase space. Recent studies on many-body localization have revealed the existence of systems that strongly violate ergodicity in the presence of quenched disorder. Here, we demonstrate that ergodicity can be weakly broken by a different mechanism, arising from the presence of special eigenstates in the many-body spectrum that are reminiscent of quantum scars in chaotic non-interacting systems. In the single-particle case, quantum scars correspond to wavefunctions that concentrate in the vicinity of unstable periodic classical trajectories. We show that many-body scars appear in the Fibonacci chain, a model with a constrained local Hilbert space that has recently been experimentally realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator. The quantum scarred eigenstates are embedded throughout the otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum but lead to direct experimental signatures, as we show for periodic recurrences that reproduce those observed in the experiment. Our results suggest that scarred many-body bands give rise to a new universality class of quantum dynamics, opening up opportunities for the creation of novel states with long-lived coherence in systems that are now experimentally realizable.},

abstract = {The X-Y model of a linear chain of spins 12, introduced by Lieb, Schultz and Mattis, is studied in the presence of a magnetic field h along the z axis. In section A the Hamiltonian is diagolalized in terms of fermion operators. In section B the magnetization along the z axis is calculated for arbitrary field and temperature. We find that there is no spontaneous magnetization and that only at zero temperature there is a phase transition of the second kind, the magnetic susceptibility being of the form c·In|h — hc| in the neighborhood of a critical field hc. In section C we derive an expression for the time-dependent correlation function ϱzR(β, t) of the z-components of spins separated by an arbitrary number R of lattice sites. Starting from this expression we will show that there is no long-range order of the z components of the spins in the absence of the field and that in the presence of a field the long-range order corresponds with the magnetization. Furthermore we discuss the time-dependent autocorrelation function of the z component of one single spin, of the total magnetization of the chain, and the possibility that Im ϱzR(β, t) satisfies a kind of wave equation, for this special case, as has been proposed by Ruygrok for more general cases. In section D the isolated chain is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium in a certain magnetic field, after which the field is suddenly changed by an arbitrary amount, and an exact expression is derived for the temporal development of the z component of the magnetization, which is found to reach an equilibrium value as time goes to infinity. In section E this exact time development is compared with the exact solution of the Kubo formalism and it is proved analytically that the Kubo formula holds for high temperatures and small perturbation, but some numerical calculations show that the development into powers of the perturbation converge very slowly. We conclude with a short discussion of the approach of Mazur and Terwiel to the relaxation of more general spin systems, in connection with our exact results on the chain.}

abstract = {The X-Y model of a linear chain of spins 12, introduced by Lieb, Schultz and Mattis, is studied in the presence of a magnetic field h along the z axis. In section A the Hamiltonian is diagolalized in terms of fermion operators. In section B the magnetization along the z axis is calculated for arbitrary field and temperature. We find that there is no spontaneous magnetization and that only at zero temperature there is a phase transition of the second kind, the magnetic susceptibility being of the form c·In|h — hc| in the neighborhood of a critical field hc. In section C we derive an expression for the time-dependent correlation function ϱzR(β, t) of the z-components of spins separated by an arbitrary number R of lattice sites. Starting from this expression we will show that there is no long-range order of the z components of the spins in the absence of the field and that in the presence of a field the long-range order corresponds with the magnetization. Furthermore we discuss the time-dependent autocorrelation function of the z component of one single spin, of the total magnetization of the chain, and the possibility that Im ϱzR(β, t) satisfies a kind of wave equation, for this special case, as has been proposed by Ruygrok for more general cases. In section D the isolated chain is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium in a certain magnetic field, after which the field is suddenly changed by an arbitrary amount, and an exact expression is derived for the temporal development of the z component of the magnetization, which is found to reach an equilibrium value as time goes to infinity. In section E this exact time development is compared with the exact solution of the Kubo formalism and it is proved analytically that the Kubo formula holds for high temperatures and small perturbation, but some numerical calculations show that the development into powers of the perturbation converge very slowly. We conclude with a short discussion of the approach of Mazur and Terwiel to the relaxation of more general spin systems, in connection with our exact results on the chain.}

For completely general commutation relations between X and Y, (the free Lie algebra), the general result is somewhat unwieldy. However in specific physics applications the commutator , while non-zero, might often be relatively simple, which sometimes leads to explicit closed form results. We consider the special case , and show that in this case the general result reduces to Furthermore we explicitly evaluate the symmetric function , demonstrating that and relate this to previously known results. For instance this result includes, but is considerably more general than, results obtained from either the Heisenberg commutator or the creation-destruction commutator .}

abstract = {We consider a classical Hamiltonian H = Lz+Mz+LxMx, where the components of L and M satisfy Poisson brackets similar to those of angular momenta. There are three constants of motion: H, L2 and M2. By studying PoincarÃ© surfaces of section, we find that the motion is regular when L2 or M2 is very small or very large. It is chaotic when both L2 and M2 have intermediate values. The interest of this model lies in its quantization, which involves finite matrices only.}

 abstract = {The Lanczos algorithm is becoming accepted as a powerful tool for finding the eigenvalues and for solving linear systems of equations. Any practical implementation of the algorithm suffers however from roundoff errors, which usually cause the Lanczos vectors to lose their mutual orthogonality. In order to maintain some level of orthogonality, full reorthogonalization (FRO) and selective orthogonalization (SO) have been used in the past as a remedy. Here partial reorthogonalization (PRO) is proposed as a new method for maintaining semiorthogonality among the Lanczos vectors. PRO is based on a simple recurrence, which allows us to monitor the loss of orthogonality among the Lanczos vectors directly without computing the inner products. Based on the information from the recurrence, reorthogonalizations occur only when necessary. Thus substantial savings are made as compared to FRO. In some numerical examples we apply the Lanczos algorithm with PRO to the solution of large symmetric systems of linear equations and show that it is a robust and efficient algorithm for maintaining semiorthogonality among the Lanczos vectors. The results obtained compare favorably with the conjugate gradient method.},

These methods are critical to the understanding of various fields in in mathematics and mathematical physics, such as nuclear excitations, ultrasonic resonances of structural materials, chaotic systems, the zeros of the Riemann and other zeta functions. More generally they apply to the characteristic energies of any sufficiently complicated system and which have found, since the publication of the second edition, many new applications in active research areas such as quantum gravity, traffic and communications networks or stock movement in the financial markets. This revised and enlarged third edition reflects the latest developements in the field and convey a greater experience with results previously formulated. For example, the theory of skew-orthogoanl and bi-orthogonal polynomials, parallel to that of the widely known and used orthogonal polynomials, is explained here for the first time. Presentation of many new results in one place for the first time. First time coverage of skew-orthogonal and bi-orthogonal polynomials and their use in the evaluation of some multiple integrals. Fredholm determinants and Painlev̌ equations. The three Gaussian ensembles (unitary, orthogonal, and symplectic); their n-point correlations, spacing probabilities.
