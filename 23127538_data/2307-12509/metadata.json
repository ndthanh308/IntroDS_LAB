  "abstract": "The algebraic tools used to study topological phases of matter are not clearly suited to studying processes in which the bulk energy gap closes, such as phase transitions. We describe an elementary two edge thought experiment which reveals the effect of an anyon condensation phase transition on the robust edge properties of a sample, bypassing a limitation of the algebraic description. In particular, the two edge construction allows some edge degrees of freedom to be tracked through the transition, despite the bulk gap closing. The two edge model demonstrates that bulk anyon condensation induces symmetry breaking in the edge model. Further, the construction recovers the expected result that the number of chiral current carrying modes at the edge cannot change through anyon condensation. We illustrate the construction through detailed analysis of anyon condensation transitions in an achiral phase, the toric code, and in chiral phases, the Kitaev spin liquids.",
