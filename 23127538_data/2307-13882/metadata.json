  "abstract": "Human culture research has witnessed an opportunity of revolution thanks to the big data and social network revolution. Websites such as Douban.com, Goodreads.com, Pandora and IMDB become the new gold mine for cultural researchers. In 2021 and 2022, the author of this paper invented 2 data-free recommender systems for AI cold-start problem. The algorithms can recommend cultural and commercial products to users without reference to users' past preferences. The social implications of the new inventions are human cultural tastes can be predicted very precisely without any information related to human individuals. In this paper, we analyze the AI technologies and its cultural implications together with other AI algorithms. We show that human culture is (mostly) a history irrelevant and predictable experience.",
