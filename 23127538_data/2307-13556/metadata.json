  "abstract": "Given a compact surface with boundary, we introduce a family of functionals on the space of its Riemannian metrics, defined via eigenvalues of a Steklov-type problem. We prove that each such functional is uniformly bounded from above, and we characterize maximizing metrics as induced by free boundary minimal immersions in some geodesic ball of a round sphere. Also, we determine that the maximizer in the case of a disk is a spherical cap of dimension two, and we prove rotational symmetry of free boundary minimal annuli in geodesic balls of round spheres which are immersed by first eigenfunctions.",

  "comment": "We redefined the eigenvalue optimization problem proposed in this paper to consider only metrics with first Laplacian eigenvalue with Dirichlet boundary condition strictly bigger than 2. This condition is satisfied by the induced metrics of free boundary minimal surfaces of radius 0<r<π/2 in the sphere",
