Follwoing the suggestions of the Referees, the following changes have been made in the 
manuscript:

1. Following the suggestions of Referee 1, three new references have been included.
They are numbered (in Red Color) as [61], [62], and [63]. A discussion related to the 
results of these works and a comparison with the results obtained in our present 
communication have been added (Red Color) in Page 4, the last paragraph of Section III, 
Subsection A, namely, "In this context, it should be appreciated.....best of our knowledge".

2. Following the suggestions of the Second Referee, we have made the following changes:

"which account for the subsets.....density of states" has been added 
immediately  after Eq.(13).

In Section III, Subsection B, (old Page 4, now Page 9), a phrase "(see Section IV)" 
in Red Color has been added.

(iii) Second Referee Comment 3): 
Page 7 (Present version) : A paragrapgh is added (red color)..."To evaluate the 
transmission coefficient......we choose the imaginary part in energy as !0^-6" has beem 
added to appreciate the results of the Transmission spectrum. This is to elaborate on the 
nature of the spectrum. This clears up any issues related to the spectrum, as we find here.

We have added a short Appendix (Appendix C) to discuss the Inverse Participation Ratio.
