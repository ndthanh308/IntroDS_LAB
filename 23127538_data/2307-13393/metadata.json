  "abstract": "An infinitely large Koch fractal is shown to be capable of sustaining only extended, Bloch-like eigenstates, if certain parameters of the Hamiltonian describing the lattice are numerically correlated in a special way, and a magnetic flux of a special strength is trapped in every loop of the geometry. We describe the system within a tight binding formalism and prescribe the desired correlation between the numerical values of the nearest neighbor overlap integrals, along with a special value of the magnetic flux trapped in the triangular loops decorating the fractal. With such conditions, the lattice, despite the absence of translational order of any kind whatsoever, yields an absolutely continuous eigenvalue spectrum, and becomes completely transparent to an incoming electron with any energy within the allowed band. The results are analytically exact. An in-depth numerical study of the inverse participation ratio and the two-terminal transmission coefficient corroborates our findings. Our conclusions remain valid for a large set of lattice models, built with the same structural units, but beyond the specific geometry of a Koch fractal, unraveling a subtle universality in a variety of such low dimensional systems.",
