  "abstract": "A construction of a quasi-random potential for cold atoms using dark states emerging in $Λ$ {level configuration} is proposed. Speckle laser fields are used as a source of randomness.\n  Anderson localisation in such potentials is studied and compared with the known results for the speckle potential itself. It is found out that the localisation length is greatly decreased due to the non-linear fashion in which dark-state potential is obtained. In effect, random dark state potentials resemble those occurring in random Kronig-Penney-type Hamiltonians.",
