In this paper we address an estimation error that stems from the non-stationarity of the time series. We put forward a method to rid the time series of local trends and variable volatility, while preserving cross-correlations. We test this method in a Monte Carlo simulation, and apply it to empirical data for the S&P 500 stocks.}

	year={2021},
	abstract={The design of reliable indicators to anticipate critical transitions in complex systems is an important task in order to detect a coming sudden regime shift and to take action in order to either prevent it or mitigate its consequences. We present a data-driven method based on the estimation of a parameterized nonlinear stochastic differential equation that allows for a robust anticipation of critical transitions even in the presence of strong noise levels like they are present in many real world systems. Since the parameter estimation is done by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach we have access to credibility bands allowing for a better interpretation of the reliability of the results. By introducing a Bayesian linear segment fit it is possible to give an estimate for the time horizon in which the transition will probably occur based on the current state of information. This approach is also able to handle nonlinear time dependencies of the parameter controlling the transition. In general the method could be used as a tool for on-line analysis to detect changes in the resilience of the system and to provide information on the probability of the occurrence of a critical transition in future.}

This is done by, first, rewriting the equation of motion in a generalized form of the Langevin equation in the stochastic theory of Brownian motion and then, either studying the average evolution of a non-equilibrium system or calculating the linear response function to a mechanical perturbation. (1) An expression is obtained for the damping function φ(t), the real part of whose Laplace transform gives the damping constnat of collective motion. (2) A general equation of motion for a set of dynamical variables At) is derived, which takes the form  where  is a frequency matrix determining the collective
oscillation of A(t). The quantity f(t) consists of those terms
which are either non-linear in A(s), t ≧s ≧0, or
dependent on the other degrees-of-freedom explicitly, and its
time-correlation function is connected with the damping function
φ(t) by (f(t1), f(t2)*) = φ(t1 − t2)·(A, A*). (3) An expression is obtained for the linear after-effect function to thermal disturbances such as temperature gradient and strain tensor. Both the conjugate fluxes and the time dependence differ from those of the mechanical response function. The conjugate fluxes are random parts of the fluxes of the state variables, thus depending on temperature. (4) The difference in the time dependence arises from a special property of the time evolution of f(t) and ensures that the damping function and the thermal after-effect function are determined by the microscopic processes in strong contrast to the mechanical response function. The difficulty of the plateau value problem in the previous theories of Brownian motion and transport coefficients is thus removed. (5) The theory is illustrated by dealing with the motion of inhomogeneous magnetization in ferromagnets and the Brownian motion of the collective coordinates of fluids. (6) Explicit expressions are derived for the thermal after-effect functions and the transport coefficients of multi-component systems.}",

 abstract = {A simple asset pricing model with two types of boundedly rational traders, fundamentalists and chartists, is studied. Fractions of trader types change over time according to evolutionary learning, with chartists conditioning their forecasting rule upon deviations from a benchmark fundamental. Volatility clustering arises endogenously and two generic mechanisms are proposed as an explanation: (1) coexistence of a stable steady state and a stable limit cycle, due to a so-called Chenciner bifurcation of the system and (2) intermittency and associated bifurcation routes to strange attractors. Economic intuition as to why these phenomena arise in nonlinear multi-agent evolutionary systems is provided.},

abstract = {This paper verifies the endogenous mechanism and economic intuition on volatility clustering using the coexistence of two locally stable attractors proposed by Gaunersdorfer et al. (2008). By considering a simple asset pricing model with two types of boundedly rational traders, fundamentalists and trend followers, and noise traders, we provide theoretical conditions on the coexistence of a locally stable steady state and a locally stable invariant circle of the underlying nonlinear deterministic financial market model and show numerically that the interaction of the coexistence of the deterministic dynamics and noise processes can endogenously generate volatility clustering and long range dependence in volatility observed in financial markets. Economically, volatility clustering occurs when neither the fundamental nor trend following traders dominate the market and when traders switch more often between the two strategies.}

We provide a unified framework to examine four excess credit supply variables and three speculation variables that have been proposed in the literature. Credit supply variables, particularly subprime share and worse originator share, strongly relate to future zip-code-level house price changes in the boom and bust, whereas none of the speculation variables consistently relate to house prices within MSAs. Pre-trends, supply elasticity, and depressed areas suggest these relations are not driven by lenders anticipating house price growth.}

abstract = {Trends and cyclical components in economic time series are modeled in a Bayesian framework. This enables prior notions about the duration of cycles to be used, while the generalized class of stochastic cycles employed allows the possibility of relatively smooth cycles being extracted. The posterior distributions of such underlying cycles can be very informative for policy makers, particularly with regard to the size and direction of the output gap and potential turning points. From the technical point of view a contribution is made in investigating the most appropriate prior distributions for the parameters in the cyclical components and in developing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for both univariate and multivariate models. Applications to US macroeconomic series are presented.}
