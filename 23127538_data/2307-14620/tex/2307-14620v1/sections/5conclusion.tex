\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
In this paper, we present NeRF-Det, a novel method that uses NeRF to learn geometry-aware volumetric representations for 3D detection from posed RGB images. We deeply integrate multi-view geometry constraints from the NeRF branch into 3D detection through a subtle shared geometry MLP. To avoid the large overhead of per-scene optimization, we propose leveraging augmented image features as priors to enhance the generalizablity of NeRF-MLP. In addition, we sample features from high resolution images instead of volumes to address the need for high-resolution images in NeRF. Our extensive experiments on the ScanNet and ARKITScene datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance for indoor 3D detection using RGB inputs. Notably, we observe that the NeRF branch also generalizes well to unseen scenes. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of NeRF for 3D detection, and provide insights into the key factors for achieving optimal performance in this direction.
