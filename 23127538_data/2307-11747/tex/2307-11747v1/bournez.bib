	abstract = {We investigate the computational complexity of various problems for simple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as formal models for recognizing weighted languages. We focus on the single-layer, ReLU-activation, rational-weight RNNs with softmax, which are commonly used in natural language processing applications. We show that most problems for such RNNs are undecidable, including consistency, equivalence, minimization, and the determination of the highest-weighted string. However, for consistent RNNs the last problem becomes decidable, although the solution length can surpass all computable bounds. If additionally the string is limited to polynomial length, the problem becomes NP-complete. In summary, this shows that approximations and heuristic algorithms are necessary in practical applications of those RNNs.},

@article{AaronsonW09,
	abstract = {While closed timelike curves (CTCs) are not known to exist, studying their consequences has led to non-trivial insights into general relativity, quantum information and other areas. In this paper, we show that, if CTCs existed, quantum computers would be no more powerful than classical computers: both would have the (extremely large) power of the complexity class polynomial space (PSPACE), consisting of all problems solvable by a conventional computer using a polynomial amount of memory. This solves an open problem proposed by one of us in 2005, and gives an essentially complete understanding of computational complexity in the presence of CTCs. Following the work of Deutsch, we treat a CTC as simply a region of spacetime where a 'causal consistency' condition is imposed, meaning that nature has to produce a (probabilistic or quantum) fixed point of some evolution operator. Our conclusion is then a consequence of the following theorem: given any quantum circuit (not necessarily unitary), a fixed point of the circuit can be (implicitly) computed in PSPACE. This theorem might have independent applications in quantum information.},

@article{Beebe2017,
	abstract = {A brief analysis of analog computation is presented, taking into account both historical and more modern statements. I show that two very different concepts are tangled together in some of the literature---namely continuous valued computation and analogy machines. I argue that a more general concept, that of model-based computation, can help us untangle this misconception. A two-dimensional view of computation is offered, in which this model-based dimension is orthogonal to the dimension concerning the type of variables used in components. I argue that this is a useful framework for assessing alternative computing devices and computational claims in an expanding landscape of computation.},

	abstract = {
    Hybrid systems are models for complex physical systems
    and are defined as dynamical systems with interacting
    discrete transitions and continuous evolutions along
    differential equations. With the goal of developing a
    theoretical and practical foundation for deductive
    verification of hybrid systems, we introduce a dynamic
    logic for hybrid programs, which is a program notation
    for hybrid systems. As a verification technique that is
    suitable for automation, we introduce a free variable
    proof calculus with a novel combination of real-valued
    free variables and Skolemisation for lifting quantifier
    elimination for real arithmetic to dynamic logic. The
    calculus is compositional, i.e., it reduces properties
    of hybrid programs to properties of their parts. Our
    main result proves that this calculus axiomatises the
    transition behaviour of hybrid systems completely
    relative to differential equations. In a case study
    with cooperating traffic agents of the European Train
    Control System, we further show that our calculus is
    well-suited for verifying realistic hybrid systems with
    parametric system dynamics.

		various apparent relationships between hypercomputation and physics. In
		this paper, we demonstrate two logical interpretations of the

		in the Standard Model). It follows that any physical
		experiment proposed as a refutation of hypercomputation would also
		refute the Standard Model itself. Therefore, the falsity of
		hypercomputation is logically inconsistent with the Standard Model.
		Hypercomputation is either logically entailed by, or else logically
		independent of, the Standard Model. We conclude this paper with the

		hypercomputational if its observable behaviour is functionally
		equivalent to that of a finite recursive system?},

		a computer are continuous rather than discrete, has enjoyed a recent

		the discrete operations, such as primitive recursion or bounded sums

		We also propose a theory of analog circuits. We prove upper and lower

	abstract = {In the last decade, there have been several attempts to
		understand the relations between the many models of analog computation.
		Unfortunately, most models are not equivalent. Euler's Gamma
		function, which is computable according to computable analysis, but
		that cannot be generated by Shannon's General Purpose Analog
		Computer (GPAC), has often been used to argue that the GPAC is less
		powerful than digital computation. However, when computability with
		GPACs is not restricted to real-time generation of functions, it
		has been shown recently that Gamma becomes computable by a GPAC.
		Here we extend this result by showing that, in an appropriate
		framework, the GPAC and computable analysis are actually equivalent
		from the computability point of view, at least in compact
		intervals. Since GPACs are equivalent to systems of polynomial
		differential equations then we show that all real computable
		functions over compact intervals can be defined by such models.},

		them from the point of view of computational complexity and also
		point out many open problems. In particular, we consider problems

		 to extend the approach and methods of finite model
		 theory beyond finite structures. We study definability
		 issues and their relation to complexity on
		 \emph{metafinite structures} which typically consist of
		 (i)~a primary part, which is a finite structure, (ii)~a
		 secondary part, which is a (usually infinite) structure
		 that can be viewed as a structured domain of numerical
		 objects, and (iii)~a set of ``weight'' functions from
		 the first part into the second. We discuss
		 model-theoretic properties of metafinite structures,
		 present results on descriptive complexity, and sketch
		 some potential applications.},

de gestion (plan de gestion)  se fait manuellement. Or, avec
l'{\'e}mergence des r{\'e}seaux ambiants caract{\'e}ris{\'e}s par une
forte dynamicit{\'e} et le grand nombre d'entit{\'e}s {\`a} g{\'e}rer,
une telle m{\'e}thode de configuration va tr{\`e}s vite devenir
impraticable. De plus, elle est intrins{\`e}quement inadapt{\'e}e dans
les r{\'e}seaux mobiles tels que les r{\'e}seaux ad hoc. Pour la
configuration et l'exploitation des services applicatifs, les protocoles
de d{\'e}couverte de services ont fait leur apparition ces derni{\`e}res
ann{\'e}es. Ils permettent de fournir des services, de les d{\'e}couvrir
et de les utiliser de mani{\`e}re transparente. Ces architectures
poss{\`e}dent une grande autonomie et peuvent fonctionner aussi bien sur
des imprimantes, des syst{\`e}mes embarqu{\'e}s que sur de puissantes
stations de travail. Dans ce m{\'e}moire nous {\'e}tudions l'apport de
ces protocoles de d{\'e}couverte de services pour la configuration du
plan de gestion. Nous proposons {\'e}galement un mod{\`e}le
d'autoconfiguration du plan de gestion, en se basant sur le protocole
DNS-SD (emploi avec le mDNS) et le protocole de gestion standard SNMP.},

	abstract = {The time-honored Chomsky hierarchy has long shown its
		 value as a structural tool in formal languages and
		 automata theory, and gained followers in various areas.
		 We show here how very similar hierarchies can be
		 obtained for families of sets of piecewise continuous
		 functions. We use systems of ordinary differential
		 equations in the same way that automata are used in
		 establishing the traditional Chomsky hierarchy. A
		 functional memory is provided by state-dependent delays
		 which are used in a novel way, paired with certain
		 state components, giving memory structures similar to
		 push-down stores and {Turing} machine tapes. The
		 resulting machine model may be viewed as a ''functional
		 computing machine'', with functional input, functional
		 memory and, though this is not emphasized here,
		 functional output. (Copyright 2005 Spinger-Verlag)},

	abstract = {We discuss in this short survey article some current
		  mathematical models from neurophysiology for the
		  computational units of biological neural systems: neurons
		  and synapses. These models are contrasted with the
		  computational units of common artificial neural network
		  models, which reflect the state of knowledge in
		  neurophysiology 50 years ago. We discuss the problem of
		  carrying out computations in circuits consisting of
		  biologically realistic computational units, focusing on the
		  biologically particularly relevant case of computations on
		  time series. Finite state machines are frequently used in
		  computer science as models for computations on time series.
		  One may argue that these models provide a reasonable common
		  conceptual basis for analyzing computations in computers
		  and biological neural systems, although the emphasis in
		  biological neural systems is shifted more towards
		  asynchronous computation on analog time series. In the
		  second half of this article some new computer experiments
		  and theoretical results are discussed, which address the
		  question whether a biological neural system can in
		  principle learn to behave like a given simple finite state
		  machine. },

@inproceedings{BC02,
	abstract = {Systems biology is a new area in biology that aims at
		 achieving a systems-level understanding of biological
		 systems. While current genome projects provide a huge
		 amount of data on genes or proteins, lots of research
		 is still necessary to understand how the different
		 parts of a biological system interact in order to
		 perform complex biological functions. Computational
		 models that help to analyze, explain or predict the
		 behavior of biological systems play a crucial role in
		 systems biology. The goal of this paper is to show that
		 hybrid concurrent constraint programming
		 (Gupta/Jagadeesan/Saraswat 98) may be a promising
		 alternative to existing modeling approaches in systems
		 biology. Hybrid cc is a declarative compositional
		 programming language with a well-defined semantics. It
		 allows one to model and simulate the dynamics of hybrid
		 systems, which exhibit both discrete and continuous
		 change. We show that Hybrid cc can be used naturally to
		 model a variety of biological phenomena, such as
		 reaching thresholds, kinetics, gene interaction or
		 biological pathways.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION The two main streams of neural networks
		 research consider neural networks either as a powerful
		 family of nonlinear statistical models, to be used in
		 for example pattern recognition applications [6], or as
		 formal models to help develop a computational
		 understanding of the brain [10]. Historically, the
		 brain theory interest was primary [32], but with the
		 advances in computer technology, the application
		 potential of the statistical modeling techniques has
		 shifted the balance. 1 The study of neural networks as
		 general computational devices does not strictly follow
		 this division of interests: rather, it provides a
		 general framework outlining the limitations and
		 possibilities aecting both research domains. The prime
		 historic example here is obviously Minsky's and
		 Papert's 1969 study of the computational limitations of
		 singlelayer perceptrons [34], which was a major inuence
		 in turning away interest from neural network learning
		 to symbolic AI techniques for more},

	abstract = {In this paper we address the complexity of solving
		 linear programming problems with a set of differential
		 equations that converge to a fixed point that
		 represents the optimal solution. Assuming a
		 probabilistic model, where the inputs are i.i.d.
		 Gaussian variables, we compute the distribution of the
		 convergence rate to the attracting fixed point. Using
		 the framework of Random Matrix Theory, we derive a
		 simple expression for this distribution in the
		 asymptotic limit of large problem size. In this limit,
		 we find the surprising result that the distribution of
		 the convergence rate is a scaling function of a single
		 variable. This scaling variable combines the
		 convergence rate with the problem size (i.e., the
		 number of variables and the number of constraints). We
		 also estimate numerically the distribution of the
		 computation time to an approximate solution, which is
		 the time required to reach a vicinity of the attracting
		 fixed point. We find that it is also a scaling
		 function. Using the problem size dependence of the
		 distribution functions, we derive high probability
		 bounds on the convergence rates and on the computation
		 times to the approximate solution. (Copyright 2004
