  "abstract": "Hybrid topologies on the real line have been studied by various authors. Among the hybrid spaces, there are also Hattori spaces. However, some of the hybrid spaces are not homeomorphic to Hattori spaces. In this article, a common generalization of at least four kinds of the hybrid topologies on the real line is described. In the absence of the axiom of choice, a quasi-metrization theorem for such hybrid spaces is proved. It is shown that Kofner's quasi-metrization theorem for generalized ordered spaces is false in every model of $\\mathbf{ZF}$ in which there exists an infinite Dedekind-finite subset of the real line.",
