	abstract = {Ice crystallization affects processes as divergent as cloud formation and rain seeding, to the growth, transportation, and preservation of the human food supply. Recent estimates show that nearly 40\% of all food is lost between the farm and the kitchen, and much of this is due to cellular damage from freezing. The discovery that nanocrystals of magnetite are one of nature{\textquoteright}s most potent ice nucleation materials indicates that this mineral, naturally present in many plant and animal tissues, is responsible for frost and freezer damage. As ice formed from supercooled water is less damaging to tissues, the ability to control ice nucleation with magnetic fields offers the promise of developing better technologies to minimize agricultural waste.In supercooled water, ice nucleation is a stochastic process that requires \~{}250{\textendash}300 molecules to transiently achieve structural ordering before an embryonic seed crystal can nucleate. This happens most easily on crystalline surfaces, in a process termed heterogeneous nucleation; without such surfaces, water droplets will supercool to below -30 {\textdegree}C before eventually freezing homogeneously. A variety of fundamental processes depends on heterogeneous ice nucleation, ranging from desert-blown dust inducing precipitation in clouds to frost resistance in plants. Recent experiments have shown that crystals of nanophase magnetite (Fe3O4) are powerful nucleation sites for this heterogeneous crystallization of ice, comparable to other materials like silver iodide and some cryobacterial peptides. In natural materials containing magnetite, its ferromagnetism offers the possibility that magneto-mechanical motion induced by external oscillating magnetic fields could act to disrupt the water{\textendash}crystal interface, inhibiting the heterogeneous nucleation process in subfreezing water and promoting supercooling. For this to act, the magneto-mechanical rotation of the particles should be higher than the magnitude of Brownian motions. We report here that 10-Hz precessing magnetic fields, at strengths of 1 mT and above, on \~{}50-nm magnetite crystals dispersed in ultrapure water, meet these criteria and do indeed produce highly significant supercooling. Using these rotating magnetic fields, we were able to elicit supercooling in two representative plant and animal tissues (celery and bovine muscle), both of which have detectable, natural levels of ferromagnetic material. Tailoring magnetic oscillations for the magnetite particle size distribution in different tissues could maximize this supercooling effect.},

Parsegian has organized his book at three successive levels of mathematical sophistication, to satisfy the needs and interests of readers at all levels of preparation. The Prelude and Level 1 are intended to give everyone an overview in words and pictures of the modern theory of van der Waals forces. Level 2 gives the formulae and a wide range of algorithms to let readers compute the van der Waals forces under virtually any physical or physiological conditions. Level 3 offers a rigorous basic formulation of the theory.},

Such grains may account for the strong millimeter-wavelength emission observed from a number of low-metallicity galaxies, including the Small Magellanic Cloud. We calculate the absorption and scattering cross sections for such grains, with particular attention to metallic Fe, magnetite Fe3O4, and maghemite γ-Fe2O3, all potentially present in the interstellar medium. The rate of Davis–Greenstein alignment by magnetic dissipation is also estimated. We determine the temperature of free-flying magnetic grains heated by starlight and calculate the polarization of the magnetic dipole emission from both free-fliers and inclusions. For inclusions, the magnetic dipole emission is expected to be polarized orthogonally relative to the normal electric dipole radiation. Magnetic dipole radiation will contribute significantly to the 20–40 GHz anomalous microwave emission only if a large fraction of the Fe is in metallic Fe iron nanoparticles with extreme elongations. Finally, we present self-consistent dielectric functions for metallic Fe, magnetite Fe3O4, and maghemite γ-Fe2O3, enabling calculation of absorption and scattering cross sections from microwave to X-ray wavelengths.}

Numerical computations of the Casimir pressure are performed for Au and SiO2 plates with an intervening layer of water and water-based ferrofluid obtained on addition to water a 5\% volume fraction of magnetite nanoparticles with 10 nm diameter. It is shown that an addition of nanoparticles leads to a widening of separation region, where the Casimir interaction is repulsive. This result does not depend on whether the plasma or the Drude model is used for extrapolation of the optical data of Au to low frequencies. The effect of enhanced repulsion due to the presence of ferrofluid may be useful for preventing stiction of closely spaced elements in various microdevices. }

The magnetic part of the interaction free energy is calculated explicitly.

%abstract = {The van der Waals force between two spherical voids surrounded by a magnetic (paramagnetic or diamagnetic) isotropic medium is calculated. Our method of calculation is analogous to the method of Mitchell and Ninham [J. Chem. Phys. 56 (1972) 1117] carried out in the electric case. A simple Lorentz form is adopted for the frequency dependent permeability. Retardation effects are ignored, whereby the electric and magnetic forces become additive. It is shown that the omission of retardation is a better approximation in the magnetic case than in the electric case due to the fact that the magnetic proper frequencies Ï‰0m appearing in the Lorentz dispersion relation are much lower than the electric proper frequencies Ï‰0e. Our formalism is generalized also to the case of finite temperatures.}

       abstract={In supercooled water, ice nucleation is a stochastic process that requires 250-300 molecules to transiently achieve structural ordering before a seed crystal can nucleate; this happens most easily on crystalline surfaces, a process termed heterogeneous nucleation. Recent experiments have shown that crystals of nanophase magnetite (Fe3O4) are powerful nucleation sites for this heterogeneous crystallization of ice, comparable to other materials like silver iodide and some cryobacterial peptides (1, 2). In natural fluids containing magnetite particles (such Aeolian dust, seawater, glacial ice, etc.), magnetite could well dominate the ice nucleation dynamics.
Magnetite nanocrystals are also common in many environmental mineral systems, as evidenced by the large field of 'Environmental Magnetism' (3). In the feldspar mineral group, which has been suggested to dominate the ice nucleation process in Aeolian dust (4), magnetite inclusions trapped during crystallization are preferentially in Na-feldspar (e.g., albite), while exsolved lamellae of magnetite are preferentially in Ca-feldspar (e.g., anorthite). Hence, the elevated data for feldspar's role in ice nucleation in clouds could be due to magnetite inclusions. We are presently testing this hypothesis.},

abstract = {An outstanding biophysical puzzle is focused on the apparent ability of weak, extremely low-frequency oscillating magnetic fields to enhance cryopreservation of many biological tissues. A recent theory holds that these weak magnetic fields could be inhibiting ice-crystal nucleation on the nanocrystals of biological magnetite (Fe3O4, an inverse cubic spinel) that are present in many plant and animal tissues by causing them to oscillate. In this theory, magnetically-induced mechanical oscillations disrupt the ability of water molecules to nucleate on the surface of the magnetite nanocrystals. However, the ability of the magnetite crystal lattice to serve as a template for heterogeneous ice crystal nucleation is as yet unknown, particularly for particles in the 10â€“100Â nm size range. Here we report that the addition of trace-amounts of finely-dispersed magnetite into ultrapure water samples reduces strongly the incidence of supercooling, as measured in experiments conducted using a controlled freezing apparatus with multiple thermocouples. SQUID magnetometry was used to quantify nanogram levels of magnetite in the water samples. We also report a relationship between the volume change of ice, and the degree of supercooling, that may indicate lower degassing during the crystallization of supercooled water. In addition to supporting the role of ice-crystal nucleation by biogenic magnetite in many tissues, magnetite nanocrystals could provide inexpensive, non-toxic, and non-pathogenic ice nucleating agents needed in a variety of industrial processes, as well as influencing the dynamics of ice crystal nucleation in many natural environments.}

abstract = {Vigorous debate still surrounds the cloud electrification process and unexplained regional variations in lightning activity. Here, we show that climatological maxima in lightning activity are associated with small effective diameter De of ice crystals near cumulonimbus cloud tops. This relationship, unlike lightning's more well-known relationship with cloud top height, is consistent over land and ocean. Since multiple studies indicate that De is reduced by atmospheric aerosol, this relationship strengthens previous suggestions of a role for aerosols as well as dynamics in electrification. Moreover, the angular distribution of backscattered radiance shows that modest (∼10\%) De decreases reflect large (∼2×) increases in the number of small (<∼30 μm) particles N, a finding supported by cloud model simulations. Both relationships provide an important new test of cloud microphysics and/or electrification models.}

abstract="We apply the scattering approach to the Casimir interaction between two dielectric half-spaces separated by an electrolyte solution. We take the nonlocal electromagnetic response of the intervening medium into account, which results from the presence of movable ions in solution. In addition to the usual transverse modes, we consider longitudinal channels and their coupling by reflection at the surface of the local dielectric. The Casimir interaction energy is calculated from the matrix describing a round-trip of coupled transverse and longitudinal waves between the interacting surfaces. The nonzero-frequency contributions are approximately unaffected by the presence of ions. We find, at zero frequency, a contribution from longitudinal channels, which is screened over a distance of the order of the Debye length, alongside an unscreened term arising from transverse-magnetic modes. The latter defines the long-distance asymptotic limit for the interaction.",

abstract = {Calculations of Hamaker constants using Lifshitz theory require the availability of accurate dielectric data, especially in the ultraviolet spectral region, and the use of a convenient and appropriate mathematical representation. In this review, a multiple oscillator model â€” the so-called Ninham-Parsegian (N-P) representation â€” has been used and spectral parameters for 31 different inorganic materials (including diamond) have been generated from critically evaluated optical data or collected from the literature. For most materials, a two-oscillator model (one UV and one IR term) was used but more detailed representations were included when available. The spectral parameters presented here can be combined with previous data, mainly focused on hydrocarbon and organic systems, to yield an extensive spectral data base for both solids and liquids enabling Lifshitz calculations of Hamaker constants for many materials combinations. Non-retarded Hamaker constants for symmetric material combinations across vacuum (A1v1) and water (A1w1) have been calculated for the different materials; these calculations were performed using the full Lifshitz theory. Asymmetric combinations, A1v3 and A1w3, against four commonly used materials in atomic force microscopy studies: silica, amorphous silicon nitride, sapphire, and muscovite mica, have also been covered. The use of a new dielectric representation for water resulted in significantly lower values of A1w1 compared to previous calculations. Analytical approximations to the full Lifshitz theory were evaluated and found to give surprisingly accurate results (the Tabor-Winterton approximation) for A1v1 when the IR contribution is of minor importance. An attempt to make the TW approximation more general by establishing some scaling relationship between n0 and Ï‰UV was met with little success; only the UV spectral parameters of the covalent oxides, sulphides and nitrides may be fitted to a simple power law relation. The Lifshitz calculations in this study were compared with an alternative method where a more detailed dielectric representation in the visible-ultraviolet spectral range was obtained through Kramers-Kronig (K-K) transformation of reflectivity data over a broad frequency range. Despite the difference in dielectric information, the two methods generally yield non-retarded Hamaker constants which do not differ significantly. This is not true for all materials, e.g. water, where a more detailed representation using either an N-P representation with several oscillators or the K-K representation must be used. It was shown that the omission of the static and low frequency contribution in the latter method may result in a significant underestimation of the value for A1w1 when the dispersive contribution becomes very small.}

abstract = {The free energy of the electrical double layer is expressed as the sum of the electrical field energy, the contribution of the entropy of the distribution of ions and, where applicable, the chemical free energy due to the preference of potential determining ions for the surface. General expressions are derived without the use of a charging process. They are given for arbitrary geometry in a form that is easily adapted for computations. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is assumed to be valid. It is shown that the results are equivalent to those obtained by the use of charging processes. A table is given in which the signs of the various contributions to the free energy of interaction of double layers are given. Two quantitative applications are treated, one showing that the entropy contributes more to the electrical free energy of a double layer than the field energy. In the second example the energy/entropy method is applied to calculate the interaction of particles with different surface potentials.}

The calculation was carried out on the basis of the Gouyâ€“Chapmanâ€“Sternâ€“Grahame double-layer model, incorporating the site-dissociation and site-binding model used previously for many oxide studies. The results demonstrated that the interaction force under surface charge regulation was always repulsive, increasing progressively with decreasing surface separation. This result is in contrast to the predictions of previous theories that are based on the Gouyâ€“Chapman (GC) double-layer model. Dependence of surface potentials and surface charge densities on the surface separation is also presented.}

The electrical double layer interaction between two dissimilar CGSG surfaces has been studied by Usui recently [S. Usui, J.

ABSTRACT = {Destabilization of intrapermafrost gas hydrates is one of the possible mechanisms responsible for methane emission in the Arctic shelf. Intrapermafrost gas hydrates may be coeval to permafrost: they originated during regression and subsequent cooling and freezing of sediments, which created favorable conditions for hydrate stability. Local pressure increase in freezing gas-saturated sediments maintained gas hydrate stability from depths of 200&ndash;250 m or shallower. The gas hydrates that formed within shallow permafrost have survived till present in the metastable (relict) state. The metastable gas hydrates located above the present stability zone may dissociate in the case of permafrost degradation as it becomes warmer and more saline. The effect of temperature increase on frozen sand and silt containing metastable pore methane hydrate is studied experimentally to reconstruct the conditions for intrapermafrost gas hydrate dissociation. The experiments show that the dissociation process in hydrate-bearing frozen sediments exposed to warming begins and ends before the onset of pore ice melting. The critical temperature sufficient for gas hydrate dissociation varies from &minus;3.0 &deg;C to &minus;0.3 &deg;C and depends on lithology (particle size) and salinity of the host frozen sediments. Taking into account an almost gradientless temperature distribution during degradation of subsea permafrost, even minor temperature increases can be expected to trigger large-scale dissociation of intrapermafrost hydrates. The ensuing active methane emission from the Arctic shelf sediments poses risks of geohazard and negative environmental impacts.},

ABSTRACT = {The accumulation of methane hydrate in marine sediments is controlled by a number of physical and biogeochemical parameters including the thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ), the solubility of methane in pore fluids, the accumulation of particulate organic carbon at the seafloor, the kinetics of microbial organic matter degradation and methane generation in marine sediments, sediment compaction and the ascent of deep-seated pore fluids and methane gas into the GHSZ. Our present knowledge on these controlling factors is discussed and new estimates of global sediment and methane fluxes are provided applying a transport-reaction model at global scale. The modeling and the data evaluation yield improved and better constrained estimates of the global pore volume within the modern GHSZ ( ≥ 44 × 1015 m3), the Holocene POC accumulation rate at the seabed (~1.4 × 1014 g yr−1), the global rate of microbial methane production in the deep biosphere (4−25 × 1012 g C yr−1) and the inventory of methane hydrates in marine sediments ( ≥ 455 Gt of methane-bound carbon).},

Ionic interaction approach: Theory and data correlation. In: K.S. Pitzer (Editor), 2nd Edition, Activity Coefficients in Electrolyte Solutions. CRC Press, Roca Raton Ann Arbor Boston London, pp. 75–153.]. Dissociation pressures are calculated for different temperature and salinity conditions ranging from 273 to 293 K and 0–70 (salinity). The solubility of methane and methane hydrate in seawater is calculated for the same temperature and salinity ranges and for hydrostatic pressures (Pdis) up to 50 MPa. Since the composition of major pore water ions may change due to a variety of geochemical processes (i.e. anaerobic oxidation of organic matter or/and methane) affecting the activity of water, additional stability and solubility calculations are presented by substituting the equivalent amount of sulfate by hydrogen carbonate ions. Based on this rigorous thermodynamic analysis, the calculation of dissociation pressures has been approximated by empirical algorithms that are functions of temperature and salinity (chlorinity for pore water). Similar algorithms are presented for the calculation of methane concentrations in seawater and pore water equilibrated with methane hydrate as functions of salinity (chlorinity for pore water), temperature and hydrostatic pressure. In contrast to earlier approaches, the provided methods allow the calculation of these properties by easily applicable functions considering a continuous variation of the control parameters over a wide range of conditions that are met in the deep marine environment."

abstract = "The presence of a wedge of offshore permafrost on the shelf of the Canadian Beaufort Sea has been previously recognized and the consequence of a prolonged occurrence of such permafrost is the possibility of an underlying gas hydrate regime. We present the first evidence for wide-spread occurrences of gas hydrates across the shelf in water depths of 60–100 m using 3D and 2D multichannel seismic (MCS) data. A reflection with a polarity opposite to the seafloor was identified ∼1000 m below the seafloor that mimics some of the bottom-simulating reflections (BSRs) in marine gas hydrate regimes. However, the reflection is not truly bottom-simulating, as its depth is controlled by offshore permafrost. The depth of the reflection decreases with increasing water depth, as predicted from thermal modeling of the late Wisconsin transgression. The reflection crosscuts strata and defines a zone of enhanced reflectivity beneath it, which originates from free gas accumulated at the phase boundary over time as permafrost and associated gas hydrate stability zones thin in response to the transgression. The wide-spread gas hydrate occurrence beneath permafrost has implications on the region including drilling hazards associated with the presence of free gas, possible overpressure, lateral migration of fluids and expulsion at the seafloor. In contrast to the permafrost-associated gas hydrates, a deep-water marine BSR was also identified on MCS profiles. The MCS data show a polarity-reversed seismic reflection associated with a low-velocity zone beneath it. The seismic data coverage in the southern Beaufort Sea shows that the deep-water marine BSR is not uniformly present across the entire region. The regional discrepancy of the BSR occurrence between the US Alaska portion and the Mackenzie Delta region may be a result of high sedimentation rates expected for the central Mackenzie delta and high abundance of mass-transport deposits that prohibit gas to accumulate within and beneath the gas hydrate stability zone."

The most widely cited estimate of global hydrate-bound gas is 21×1015 m3 of methane at STP (or ∼10,000 Gt of methane carbon), which is proposed as a “consensus value” from several independent estimations. This large gas hydrate reservoir is further suggested as an important component of the global carbon cycle and as a future energy source. Here, I present a revised and updated set of well-justified global estimates and discuss how and why they changed over time. It appears that the global estimates of hydrate-bound gas decreased by at least one order of magnitude from 1970s–early 1980s (estimates on the order of 1017–1018 m3) to late 1980s–early 1990s (1016 m3) to late 1990s–present (1014–1015 m3). The decrease of estimates is a result of growing knowledge of the distribution and concentration of gas hydrates in marine sediments and ongoing efforts to better constrain the volume of hydrate-bearing sediments and their gas yield. These parameters appear to be relatively well constrained at present through DSDP/ODP drilling and direct measurements of gas concentrations in sediments. The global estimate of hydrate-bound gas that best reflects the current knowledge of submarine gas hydrate is in the range (1–5)×1015 m3 (∼500–2500 Gt of methane carbon). A significantly smaller global gas hydrate inventory implies that the role of gas hydrates in the global carbon cycle may not be as significant as speculated previously. Gas hydrate may be considered a future energy source not because the global volume of hydrate-bound gas is large, but because some individual gas hydrate accumulations may contain significant and concentrated resources that may be profitably recovered in the future."

Arctic and in sediments on the continental margins. They are a potentially vast

pressure–temperature conditions due to climate change, potentially leading to strong
positive carbon–climate feedbacks. To enhance our understanding of both the
vulnerability of and the opportunity provided by methane hydrates, it is necessary (i) to
conduct basic research that improves the highly uncertain estimates of hydrate
occurrences and their response to changing environmental conditions, and (ii) to
integrate the agendas of energy security and climate change which can provide an
opportunity for methane hydrates—in particular if combined with carbon capture and
storage—to be used as a ‘bridge fuel’ between carbon-intensive fossil energies
and zero-emission energies. Taken one step further, exploitation of dissociating
methane hydrates could even mitigate against escape of methane to the atmosphere.
Despite these opportunities, so far, methane hydrates have been largely absent
from energy and climate discussions, including global hydrocarbon assessments
and the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change.}

Changes in bottom water temperatures may lead to their destabilization and the release of methane into the water column or even the atmosphere. In a multimodel approach, the possible impact of destabilizing methane hydrates onto global climate within the next century is evaluated. The focus is set on changing bottom water temperatures to infer the response of the global methane hydrate inventory to future climate change. Present and future bottom water temperatures are evaluated by the combined use of hindcast high-resolution ocean circulation simulations and climate modeling for the next century. The changing global hydrate inventory is computed using the parameterized transfer function recently proposed by Wallmann et al. (2012). We find that the present-day world's total marine methane hydrate inventory is estimated to be 1146 Gt of methane carbon. Within the next 100 years this global inventory may be reduced by ∼0.03\% (releasing ∼473 Mt methane from the seafloor). Compared to the present-day annual emissions of anthropogenic methane, the amount of methane released from melting hydrates by 2100 is small and will not have a major impact on the global climate. On a regional scale, ocean bottom warming over the next 100 years will result in a relatively large decrease in the methane hydrate deposits, with the Arctic and Blake Ridge region, offshore South Carolina, being most affected.},

The stability of marine hydrates is sensitive to changes in temperature and pressure and once destabilised, hydrates release methane into sediments and ocean and potentially into the atmosphere, creating a positive feedback with climate change. Here we present results from a multi-model study investigating how the methane hydrate inventory dynamically responds to different scenarios of future climate and sea level change. The results indicate that a warming-induced reduction is dominant even when assuming rather extreme rates of sea level rise (up to 20mmyr−1) under moderate warming scenarios (RCP 4.5). Over the next century modelled hydrate dissociation is focussed in the top ∼100m of Arctic and Subarctic sediments beneath <500m water depth. Predicted dissociation rates are particularly sensitive to the modelled vertical hydrate distribution within sediments. Under the worst case business-as-usual scenario (RCP 8.5), upper estimates of resulting global sea-floor methane fluxes could exceed estimates of natural global fluxes by 2100 (>30–50TgCH4yr−1), although subsequent oxidation in the water column could reduce peak atmospheric release rates to 0.75–1.4Tg CH4yr−1."

The low reflectance, or blanking, above the BSR is caused by lithologic homogeneity of the sediments rather than by hydrate cementation.

abstract = "Extreme global warmth and an abrupt negative carbon isotope excursion during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) have been attributed to a massive release of methane hydrate from sediments on the continental slope [1]. However, the magnitude of the warming (5 to 6 °C [2],[3]) and rise in the depth of the CCD (>2 km; [4]) indicate that the size of the carbon addition was larger than can be accounted for by the methane hydrate hypothesis. Additional carbon sources associated with methane hydrate release (e.g. pore-water venting and turbidite oxidation) are also insufficient. We find that the oxidation of at least 5000 Gt C of organic carbon is the most likely explanation for the observed geochemical and climatic changes during the PETM, for which there are several potential mechanisms. Production of thermogenic CH4 and CO2 during contact metamorphism associated with the intrusion of a large igneous province into organic rich sediments [5] is capable of supplying large amounts of carbon, but is inconsistent with the lack of extensive carbon loss in metamorphosed sediments, as well as the abrupt onset and termination of carbon release during the PETM. A global conflagration of Paleocene peatlands [6] highlights a large terrestrial carbon source, but massive carbon release by fire seems unlikely as it would require that all peatlands burn at once and then for only 10 to 30 ky. In addition, this hypothesis requires an order of magnitude increase in the amount of carbon stored in peat. The isolation of a large epicontinental seaway by tectonic uplift associated with volcanism or continental collision, followed by desiccation and bacterial respiration of the aerated organic matter is another potential mechanism for the rapid release of large amounts of CO2. In addition to the oxidation of the underlying marine sediments, the desiccation of a major epicontinental seaway would remove a large source of moisture for the continental interior, resulting in the desiccation and bacterial oxidation of adjacent terrestrial wetlands."

abstract = {Future global warming due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases has the potential to destabilize methane clathrates, which are found in permafrost regions and in continental slope sediments worldwide, resulting in the release of methane gas. Since methane is a strong greenhouse gas, this could produce a potentially important positive feedback. Here, the coupled heat transfer and methane destabilization process in oceanic sediments is modeled in a series of one-dimensional, vertical columns on a 1°×1° global grid. Terrestrial permafrost is divided into 11 columns based on mean annual surface air temperature. Our base case clathrate distribution results in about 24,000 Gt C as methane clathrate in marine sediments and about 800 Gt C in terrestrial sediments, only a small fraction of which could be destabilized by future global warming. Scenarios of anthropogenic CO2 and CH4 emission are used to drive a simple model of the carbon cycle, yielding scenarios of CO2 and CH4 concentration increase. These increases drive a one-dimensional coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model. Globally averaged temperature changes as a function of time and ocean depth are used as upper boundary conditions to drive the heat transfer/methane clathrate release models. Three versions of the ocean model are used which result in different temperature perturbations at the sediment-water interface: a purely diffusive ocean model, an upwelling-diffusion ocean model with fixed temperature of bottom water formation, and an upwelling-diffusion ocean model with a feedback between surface temperature and the upwelling velocity. Methane release from clathrate destabilization is added to the anthropogenic CH4 emission, leading to stronger increases in both CH4 and CO2 concentration. Based on a wide variety of parameter input assumptions and anthropogenic emission scenarios, it appears that the potential impact on global warming of methane clathrate destabilization is smaller than the difference in warming between low and medium, or medium and high anthropogenic CO2 emission scenarios, or arising from a factor of two variation in climate sensitivity. Global warming increases by 10–25\% compared to the case without clathrate destabilization for our scenarios using what, in many respects, are worst case assumptions.},

abstract = {Estimates of the magnitudes and spatial distribution of potential oceanic methane hydrate reservoirs have been made from pressure-temperature phase relations and a plausible range of thermal gradients, sediment porosities, and pore fillings taken from published sources, based on two major theories of gas hydrate formation (1) in situ bacterial production and (2) pore fluid expulsion models. The implications of these two models on eventual atmospheric methane release, due to global warming, are briefly examined. The calculated range of methane volumes in oceanic gas hydrates is 26.4 to 139.1 × 1015 m3, with the most likely value on the lower end of this range. The results for the bacterial model show a preferential distribution of hydrates at mid- to high latitudes, with an equatorial enhancement in the case of the fluid migration model. The latter model also generates a deeper and thicker hydrate stability zone at most latitudes than does the former. Preliminary results suggest that the hydrate distribution predicted by the fluid migration model may be more consistent with observations. However, this preliminary finding is based on a very limited sample size, and there are high uncertainties in the assumptions. The volume of methane hydrate within the uppermost l m of the hydrate stability zone and within 1°-2°C of the equilibrium curve, assuming in situ bacterial generation, is 0.93–6.32 × 1012 m3, or 0.0035–0.012\% of the maximal estimated hydrate reservoir. Nevertheless this volume, if released uniformly over the next 100 years, is comparable to current CH4 release rates for several important CH4 sources. Corresponding CH4 volumes calculated using the fluid migration model are nearly 2 orders of magnitude lower.},

abstract = {Isotopic records across the “Latest Paleocene Thermal Maximum“ (LPTM) indicate that bottom water temperature increased by more than 4°C during a brief time interval (<104 years) of the latest Paleocene (∼55.6 Ma). There also was a coeval −2 to −3‰ excursion in the δ13C of the ocean/atmosphere inorganic carbon reservoir. Given the large mass of this reservoir, a rapid δ13C shift of this magnitude is difficult to explain within the context of conventional hypotheses for changing the mean carbon isotope composition of the ocean and atmosphere. However, a direct consequence of warming bottom water temperature from 11 to 15°C over 104 years would be a significant change in sediment thermal gradients and dissociation of oceanic CH4 hydrate at locations with intermediate water depths. In terms of the present-day oceanic CH4 hydrate reservoir, thermal dissociation of oceanic CH4 hydrate during the LPTM could have released greater than 1.1 to 2.1 × 1018 g of carbon with a δ13C of approximately −60‰. The release and subsequent oxidation of this amount of carbon is sufficient to explain a −2 to −3‰ excursion in δ13C across the LPTM. Fate of CH4 in oceanic hydrates must be considered in developing models of the climatic and paleoceanographic regimes that operated during the LPTM.},

abstract = "This study provides new estimates for the global offshore methane hydrate inventory formed due to microbial CH4 production under Quaternary and Holocene boundary conditions. A multi-1D model for particular organic carbon (POC) degradation, gas hydrate formation and dissolution is presented. The novel reaction-transport model contains an open three-phase system of two solid compounds (organic carbon, gas hydrates), three dissolved species (methane, sulfates, inorganic carbon) and one gaseous phase (free methane). The model computes time-resolved concentration profiles for all compounds by accounting for chemical reactions as well as diffusive and advective transport processes. The reaction module builds upon a new kinetic model of POC degradation which considers a down-core decrease in reactivity of organic matter. Various chemical reactions such as organic carbon decay, anaerobic oxidation of methane, methanogenesis, and sulfate reduction are resolved using appropriate kinetic rate laws and constants. Gas hydrates and free gas form if the concentration of dissolved methane exceeds the pressure, temperature, and salinity-dependent solubility limits of hydrates and/or free gas, with a rate given by kinetic parameters. Global input grids have been compiled from a variety of oceanographic, geological and geophysical data sets including a new parameterization of sedimentation rates in terms of water depth. We find prominent gas hydrate provinces offshore Central America where sediments are rich in organic carbon and in the Arctic Ocean where low bottom water temperatures stabilize methane hydrates. The world’s total gas hydrate inventory is estimated at 0.82×1013m3–2.10×1015m3CH4 (at STP conditions) or, equivalently, 4.18–995 Gt of methane carbon. The first value refers to present day conditions estimated using the relatively low Holocene sedimentation rates; the second value corresponds to a scenario of higher Quaternary sedimentation rates along continental margins. Our results clearly show that in-situ POC degradation is at present not an efficient hydrate forming process. Significant hydrate deposits in marine settings are more likely to have formed at times of higher sedimentation during the Quaternary or as a consequence of upward fluid transport at continental margins."

abstract  ="For the past three decades{,} discussion of naturally-occurring gas hydrates has been framed by a series of assessments that indicate enormous global volumes of methane present within gas hydrate accumulations. At present{,} these estimates continue to range over several orders of magnitude{,} creating great uncertainty in assessing those two gas hydrate issues that relate most directly to resource volumes – gas hydrate’s potential as an energy resource and its possible role in ongoing climate change. However{,} a series of recent field expeditions have provided new insights into the nature of gas hydrate occurrence; perhaps most notably{,} the understanding that gas hydrates occur in a wide variety of geologic settings and modes of occurrence. These fundamental differences - which include gas hydrate concentration{,} host lithology{,} distribution within the sediment matrix{,} burial depth{,} water depth{,} and many others - can now be incorporated into evaluations of gas hydrate energy resource and environmental issues. With regard to energy supply potential{,} field data combined with advanced numerical simulation have identified gas-hydrate-bearing sands as the most feasible initial targets for energy recovery. The first assessments of potential technically-recoverable resources are now occurring{,} enabling a preliminary estimate of ultimate global recoverable volumes on the order of ~3 × 1014 m3 (1016 ft3; ∼150 GtC). Other occurrences{,} such as gas hydrate-filled fractures in clay-dominated reservoirs{,} may also become potential energy production targets in the future; but as yet{,} no production concept has been demonstrated. With regard to the climate implications of gas hydrate{,} an analogous partitioning of global resources to determine that portion most prone to dissociation during specific future warming scenarios is needed. At present{,} it appears that these two portions of total gas hydrate resources (those that are the most likely targets for gas extraction and those that are the most likely to respond in a meaningful way to climate change) will be largely exclusive{,} as those deposits that are the most amenable to production (the more deeply buried and localized accumulations) are also those that are the most poorly coupled to oceanic and atmospheric conditions."}

Global warming could destabilize these hydrates and cause a release of methane (CH4) into the water column and possibly the atmosphere. Since the Arctic has and will be warmed considerably, Arctic bottom water temperatures and their future evolution projected by a climate model were analyzed. The resulting warming is spatially inhomogeneous, with the strongest impact on shallow regions affected by Atlantic inflow. Within the next 100 years, the warming affects 25\% of shallow and mid-depth regions containing methane hydrates. Release of methane from melting hydrates in these areas could enhance ocean acidification and oxygen depletion in the water column. The impact of methane release on global warming, however, would not be significant within the considered time span.},

Thus, contemporary observations of strong methane venting do not necessarily mean that the clathrates that are the source of the methane are decomposing at a faster rate than in the past. Methane hydrate is an icelike substance that is stable at high pressure and low temperature in continental margin sediments. Since the discovery of a large number of gas flares at the landward termination of the gas hydrate stability zone off Svalbard, there has been concern that warming bottom waters have started to dissociate large amounts of gas hydrate and that the resulting methane release may possibly accelerate global warming. Here, we corroborate that hydrates play a role in the observed seepage of gas, but we present evidence that seepage off Svalbard has been ongoing for at least 3000 years and that seasonal fluctuations of 1{\textdegree} to 2{\textdegree}C in the bottom-water temperature cause periodic gas hydrate formation and dissociation, which focus seepage at the observed sites.},

abstract  ="In this work we perform computer simulations of the ice surface in order to elucidate the role of nitrogen in the crystal growth rates and crystal habits of snow in the atmosphere. In pure water vapor at temperatures typical of ice crystal formation in cirrus clouds{,} we find that basal and primary prismatic facets exhibit a layer of premelted ice{,} with thickness in the subnanometer range. For partial pressures of 1 bar{,} well above the expected values in the troposphere{,} we find that only small amounts of nitrogen are adsorbed. The adsorption takes place onto the premelted surface{,} and hardly any nitrogen dissolves within the premelting film. The premelting film thickness does not change either. We quantify the resulting change of the ice/vapor surface tension to be in the hundredth of mN m−1 and find that the structure of the pristine ice surface is not changed in a significant manner. We perform a trajectory analysis of colliding water molecules{,} and find that the attachment rates from direct ballistic collision are very close to unity irrespective of the nitrogen pressure. Nitrogen is however at sufficient density to deflect a fraction of trajectories with smaller distance than the mean free path. Our results show explicitly that the reported differences in growth rates measured in pure water vapor and a controlled nitrogen atmosphere are not related to a significant disruption of the ice surface due to nitrogen adsorption. On the contrary{,} we show clearly from our trajectory analysis that nitrogen slows down the crystal growth rates due to collisions between water molecules with bulk nitrogen gas. This clarifies the long standing controversy of the role of inert gases on crystal growth rates and demonstrates their influence is solely related to the diffusion limited flow of water vapor across the gas phase."}

abstract = {Many icy Solar System bodies possess subsurface oceans. On Pluto, Sputnik Planitia's location near the equator suggests the presence of a subsurface ocean and a locally thinned ice shell. To maintain an ocean, Pluto needs to retain heat inside. On the other hand, to maintain large variations in its thickness, Pluto's ice shell needs to be cold. Here we show, by thermal evolution and viscous relaxation calculations, that the presence of a thin layer of clathrate hydrates (gas hydrates) at the base of the ice shell can explain both the long-term survival of the ocean and the maintenance of shell thickness contrasts. Clathrate hydrates act as a thermal insulator, preventing the ocean from completely freezing while keeping the ice shell cold and immobile. The most likely clathrate guest gas is methane, derived from precursor bodies and/or cracking of organic materials in the hot rocky core. Nitrogen molecules initially contained and/or produced later in the core would probably not be trapped as clathrate hydrates, instead supplying the nitrogen-rich surface and atmosphere. The formation of a thin clathrate hydrate layer cap to a subsurface ocean may be an important generic mechanism to maintain long-lived subsurface oceans in relatively large but minimally heated icy satellites and Kuiper belt objects.},

The treatment, which includes the case of magnetic and conducting media, is valid for all temperatures and includes retardation effects. The method is an extension of one used by van Kampen (1968) and considers the free energy of electromagnetic surface modes in the region between the two media. The result reduces to that derived using Green function techniques by Lifshitz et al. (1961) for nonmagnetic media.}

The Cassini cosmic dust analyser (CDA) measured the mass spectra of nearly 300 impacting dust particles during the 2004 October E ring crossing. An initial interpretation of the data shows that the particles are predominantly water ice, with minor contributions from possible combinations of silicates, carbon dioxide, ammonia, molecular nitrogen, hydrocarbons and perhaps carbon monoxide. This places constraints on both the composition of Enceladus, the main source of the E ring, as well as the grain formation mechanisms.},

abstract = "The tenuous E ring of Saturn is found to commence abruptly at 3 Saturn radii, to peak sharply in the vicinity of the orbit of the satellite Enceladus (about 4 radii), and to spread out thinly to more than 8 radii. This distribution strongly suggests it to be associated with Enceladus and perhaps to be material ejected from Enceladus. The spread of E-ring material above and below the ring plane is greater in its tenuous outskirts than in its denser inner region, suggesting that the E ring may be at an early stage in its evolution. Thus far, our analysis reveals only a marginal variation of the ring with time or Enceladus azimuth. In this paper we describe the special instrumentation used for photometric observations of the E ring, and we present some of the data obtained in March 1980. In Paper II we shall derive the three-dimensional distribution of material in the E ring and discuss its cosmogonic implications."

Significant changes are made to nearly all spectral regions. The blue and near-ultraviolet absorption is much weaker than the prior estimates, which were already very small. The near-infrared absorption coefficient differs by as much as a factor of 2 from the prior compilation at some wavelengths. The midinfrared absorption coefficient is rather uncertain in the weakly absorbing regions near 9 and 20 μm. New far-infrared measurements at low temperatures are extrapolated to higher temperatures, which shifts the peak positions. New microwave measurements find absorption much weaker than previously reported, by factors of 2–5. The real part of the index of refraction is computed using Kramers-Kronig analysis; it differs from the prior compilation only in the far infrared.

Primary surface decomposition of gas hydrates leads to the formation of an isolating ice film on the surface of hydrate particles, which stops their further decomposition, and so gas hydrates can exist at low pressures for a very long time. Geologic applications of the effect are discussed. Gas hydrate decomposition in unfrozen rocks at low temperatures (0 to + 5Â°C) can initiate permafrost rocks formation as a consequence of heat through phase transitions of hydrates. Special experiments on rocks freezing by decomposing gas hydrates were made. Thermodynamic two-phase equilibrium between ice and methane hydrate is discussed with the Van Der Waals-Platteeuw clathrate solution model.}

Exposure of the Arctic shelf during the last glacial cycle formed a thick layer of permafrost, protecting hydrate deposits below. However, talik formation below paleo-river channels creates permeable pathways for gas migration from depth. An estimate of the maximum gas flux at the present time for conditions at the East Siberian Arctic Seas is 0.2047 kg yrâˆ’1 mâˆ’2, which produces a methane concentration of 142â€‰nM in the overlying water column, consistent with several field observations. For conditions at the North American Beaufort Sea, the maximum gas flux at the present time is 0.1885 kg yrâˆ’1 mâˆ’2, which produces a methane concentration of 78 nM in the overlying water column. Shallow sediments are charged with residual methane gas after venting events. Sustained submergence into the future should increase gas venting rate roughly exponentially as sediments continue to warm. Studying permafrost-associated gas hydrate reservoirs will allow us to better understand the Arctic's contribution to the global methane budget and global warming.},

    abstract = { Abstract We review the reservoirs of methane clathrates that may exist in the different bodies of the Solar System. Methane was formed in the interstellar medium prior to having been embedded in the protosolar nebula gas phase. This molecule was subsequently trapped in clathrates that formed from crystalline water ice during the cooling of the disk and incorporated in this form into the building blocks of comets, icy bodies, and giant planets. Methane clathrates may play an important role in the evolution of planetary atmospheres. On Earth, the production of methane in clathrates is essentially biological, and these compounds are mostly found in permafrost regions or in the sediments of continental shelves. On Mars, methane would more likely derive from hydrothermal reactions with olivine-rich material. If they do exist, martian methane clathrates would be stable only at depth in the cryosphere and sporadically release some methane into the atmosphere via mechanisms that remain to be determined. In the case of Titan, most of its methane probably originates from the protosolar nebula, where it would have been trapped in the clathrates agglomerated by the satellite's building blocks. Methane clathrates are still believed to play an important role in the present state of Titan. Their presence is invoked in the satellite's subsurface as a means of replenishing its atmosphere with methane via outgassing episodes. The internal oceans of Enceladus and Europa also provide appropriate thermodynamic conditions that allow formation of methane clathrates. In turn, these clathrates might influence the composition of these liquid reservoirs. Finally, comets and Kuiper Belt Objects might have formed from the agglomeration of clathrates and pure ices in the nebula. The methane observed in comets would then result from the destabilization of clathrate layers in the nuclei concurrent with their approach to perihelion. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations show that methane-rich clathrate layers may exist on Pluto as well. Key Words: Methane clathrate—Protosolar nebula—Terrestrial planets—Outer Solar System.

abstract = "The E ring is a loose collection of debris orbiting Saturn well outside the classical ring system. Compared to the classical ring system, the E ring is extraordinarily tenuous but occupies an enormous volume. The optical depth has a pronounced maximum near the orbit of Enceladus, which is therefore widely assumed to be the source of ring material. Optical properties of the ring suggest a collection of micron-sized spheroids whose composition is generally supposed to be water ice in accordance with the assumed Enceladus source. Apart from its unusual physical properties, the very existence of the E ring as a permanent feature of the Saturn system is problematical. The particles of the ring are susceptible to erosion by ion sputtering and outward transport by ion drag. Lifetimes against either of these processes in the presence of observed ion populations are estimated to be no more than a few thousand years, and it is not clear that Enceladus can replenish the ring particles continuously on such a time scale. It has thus been suggested that the E ring is a transient feature of the Saturn system, resulting from an episodic disturbance of Enceladus (e.g., a sizeable meteoroid impact or tectonic event) in the recent past. In any case, the E ring presently provides a convenient natural probe of magnetospheric transport processes because it presents a marginally significant cross section for the absorption of magnetospherically-trapped particles traversing its volume."

Nonetheless, relaxation times and dispersion amplitudes discourage the discussion of the water structure in terms of a two-state model.

	abstract = {Saturn’s moon Enceladus is erupting a plume of gas and ice grains from its south pole. Linked directly to the moon’s subsurface global ocean, plume material travels through cracks in the icy crust and is ejected into space. The subsurface ocean is believed to be in contact with the rocky core, with ongoing hydrothermal activity present. The Cassini spacecraft’s Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer ({INMS}) detected volatile, gas phase, organic species in the plume and the Cosmic Dust Analyser ({CDA}) discovered high-mass, complex organic material in a small fraction of ice grains. Here, we present a broader compositional analysis of {CDA} mass spectra from organic-bearing ice grains. Through analogue experiments, we find spectral characteristics attributable to low-mass organic compounds in the Enceladean ice grains: nitrogen-bearing, oxygen-bearing, and aromatic. By comparison with {INMS} results, we identify low-mass amines [particularly (di)methylamine and/or ethylamine] and carbonyls (with acetic acid and/or acetaldehyde most suitable) as the best candidates for the N- and O-bearing compounds, respectively. Inferred organic concentrations in individual ice particles vary but may reach tens of mmol levels. The low-mass nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing compounds are dissolved in the ocean, evaporating efficiently at its surface and entering the ice grains via vapour adsorption. The potentially partially water soluble, low-mass aromatic compounds may alternatively enter ice grains via aerosolization. These amines, carbonyls, and aromatic compounds could be ideal precursors for mineral-catalysed Friedel–Crafts hydrothermal synthesis of biologically relevant organic compounds in the warm depths of Enceladus’ ocean.},

These experimental results are consistent with previously reported thermodynamic predictions and experimental results obtained with artificial seawater.

A new scheme of diffusional growth allows the reproduction of in situ–measured droplet size distributions including those formed in extremely polluted air. It was shown that pyroclouds forming over the forest fires can precipitate. Several mechanisms leading to formation of precipitation from pyroclouds are considered. The mechanisms by which aerosols affect the microphysics and precipitation of warm cloud-base clouds have been investigated by analyzing the mass, heat, and moisture budgets. The increase in aerosol concentration increases both the generation and the loss of the condensate mass. In the clouds developing in dry air, the increase in the loss is dominant, which suggests a decrease in the accumulated precipitation with the aerosol concentration increase. On the contrary, an increase in aerosol concentration in deep maritime clouds leads to an increase in precipitation. The precipitation efficiency of clouds in polluted air is found to be several times lower than that of clouds forming in clean air. A classification of the results of aerosol effects on precipitation from clouds of different types developing in the atmosphere with high freezing level (about 4 km) is proposed. The role of air humidity and other factors in precipitation’s response to aerosols is discussed. The analysis shows that many discrepancies between the results reported in different observational and numerical studies can be attributed to the different atmospheric conditions and cloud types analyzed. }

abstract = {Abstract The experimental measurement of water retention curve in hydrate-bearing sediments is critically important to understand the behavior of hydrate dissociation and gas production. In this study, tetrahydrofuran (THF) is selected as hydrate former. The pore habit of THF hydrates is investigated by visual observation in a transparent micromodel. It is confirmed that THF hydrates are not wetting phase on the quartz surface of the micromodel and occupy either an entire pore or part of pore space resulting in change in pore size distribution. And the measurement of water retention curves in THF hydrate-bearing sediments with hydrate saturation ranging from Sh=0 to Sh=0.7 is conducted for excess water condition. The experimental results show that the gas entry pressure and the capillary pressure increase with increasing hydrate saturation. Based on the experimental results, fitting parameters for van Genuchten equation are suggested for different hydrate saturation conditions.}

abstract = {Hydrate-bearing sediments may destabilize spontaneously as part of geological processes, unavoidably during petroleum drilling/production operations or intentionally as part of gas extraction from the hydrate itself. In all cases, high pore fluid pressure generation is anticipated during hydrate dissociation. A comprehensive formulation is derived for the prediction of fluid pressure evolution in hydrate-bearing sediments subjected to thermal stimulation without mass transfer. The formulation considers pressure- and temperature-dependent volume changes in all phases, effective stress-controlled sediment compressibility, capillarity, and the relative solubilities of fluids. Salient implications are explored through parametric studies. The model properly reproduces experimental data, including the PT evolution along the phase boundary during dissociation and the effect of capillarity. Pore fluid pressure generation is proportional to the initial hydrate fraction and the sediment bulk stiffness; is inversely proportional to the initial gas fraction and gas solubility; and is limited by changes in effective stress that cause the failure of the sediment. When the sediment stiffness is high, the generated pore pressure reflects thermal and pressure changes in water, hydrate, and mineral densities. Comparative analyses for CO2 and CH4 highlight the role of gas solubility in excess pore fluid pressure generation. Dissociation in small pores experiences melting point depression due to changes in water activity, and lower pore fluid pressure generation due to the higher gas pressure in small gas bubbles. Capillarity effects may be disregarded in silts and sands, when hydrates are present in nodules and lenses and when the sediment experiences hydraulic fracture.}

ABSTRACT = {Adhesion (cohesion) and agglomeration properties of gas hydrate particles have been a key to hydrate management in flow assurance in natural gas pipelines. Despite its importance, the relevant data in the area, such as the surface energy and the interfacial energy of gas hydrates with gas and/or water, are scarce; presumably due to the experimental difficulties involved in the measurements. Here we review what is known about the surface energy and the interfacial energy of gas hydrates to date. In particular,  we ask a question as to whether pre-melting can occur on the surface of gas hydrates. Surface thermodynamic analyses show that pre-melting is favoured to occur on the surface of gas hydrates, however, not sufficient data are available to assess its thickness. The effects of the existence of pre-melting layers on the cohesion and friction forces between gas hydrate particles are also discussed.},

Indices of refraction have been computed with a modified Lorenz–Lorentz model for a pressure between 2 and 15 MPa, a temperature between 0 and 12 ° C and wavelengths in the extended visible domain. Given the prohibitive time required to perform the calculations with the standard procedure (up to 20 min for one P–T–λ set), we considered separately the crystalline structure and the molecules that occupy its sites. Thus, we obtain a series of tensors, characterising the sole structure, that we can easily use to get the refractive indices within less than 1 s. In this paper, all data are given to calculate the absolute or relative refractive index of any gas hydrate, provided the host gas polarisability is known. The numerical results are in agreement with experimental data.}

	abstract = {While the trends in greenhouse gas concentrations in recent decades are clear, their significance is only revealed when viewed in the context of a longer time period. Fortunately, the air bubbles in polar ice cores provide an unusually direct method of determining the concentrations of stable gases over a period of (so far) 800 000 years. Measurements on different cores with varying characteristics, as well as an overlap of ice-core and atmospheric measurements covering the same time period, show that the ice-core record provides a faithful record of changing atmospheric composition. The mixing ratio of CO2 is now 30 per cent higher than any value observed in the ice-core record, while methane is more than double any observed value; the rate of change also appears extraordinary compared with natural changes. Before the period when anthropogenic changes have dominated, there are very interesting natural changes in concentration, particularly across glacial/interglacial cycles, and these can be used to understand feedbacks in the Earth system. The phasing of changes in temperature and CO2 across glacial/interglacial transitions is consistent with the idea that CO2 acts as an important amplifier of climate changes in the natural system. Even larger changes are inferred to have occurred in periods earlier than the ice cores cover, and these events might be used to constrain assessments of the way the Earth could respond to higher than present concentrations of CO2, and to a large release of carbon: however, more certainty about CO2 concentrations beyond the time period covered by ice cores is needed before such constraints can be fully realized.},

	abstract = {Directional drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies are dramatically increasing natural-gas extraction. In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1~km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64~mg CH4~L-1 (n~=~26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1~km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1~mg~L-1 (P~\&lt;~0.05; n~=~34). Average δ13C-CH4 values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37~{\textpm}~7{\textperthousand} and -54~{\textpm}~11{\textperthousand}, respectively; P~\&lt;~0.0001). These δ13C-CH4 data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and δ2H-CH4 values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and{\textemdash}possibly{\textemdash}regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.},

  abstract={Several mechanisms can extend the equilibrium domain of a liquid phase into the solid region of the normal phase diagram. The causes of premelting, which include surface melting, interface curvature and substrate disorder, occur in all types of substances, including H 2 O. In the case of H 2 O, premelting can have important environmental consequences, among which are the heaving of frozen ground, breakdown of rock and concrete, sintering of snow, flow of glaciers, scavenging of atmospheric trace gases by snow and ice, and the electrification of thunderclouds. The article reviews the basic mechanisms of premelting and discusses their roles in the environmental phenomena. The principal results of numerous studies are reviewed, and trends in current research are outlined.}

  abstract={We present spectra of Eris from the MMT 6.5 m Telescope and Red Channel Spectrograph (5700-9800 Å, 5 Å pixel –1 ) on Mt. Hopkins, AZ, and of Pluto from the Steward Observatory 2.3 m Telescope and Boller and Chivens Spectrograph (7100-9400 Å, 2 Å pixel –1 ) on Kitt Peak, AZ. In addition, we present laboratory transmission spectra of methane-nitrogen and methane-argon ice mixtures. By anchoring our analysis in methane and nitrogen solubilities in one another as expressed in the phase diagram of Prokhvatilov & Yantsevich, and comparing methane bands in our Eris and Pluto spectra and methane bands in our laboratory spectra of methane and nitrogen ice mixtures, we find Eris' bulk methane and nitrogen abundances are ~10procent and ~90procent and Pluto's bulk methane and nitrogen abundances are ~3\% and ~97\%. Such abundances for Pluto are consistent with values reported in the literature. It appears that the bulk volatile composition of Eris is similar to the bulk volatile composition of Pluto. Both objects appear to be dominated by nitrogen ice. Our analysis also suggests, unlike previous work reported in the literature, that the methane and nitrogen stoichiometry is constant with depth into the surface of Eris. Finally, we point out that our Eris spectrum is also consistent with a laboratory ice mixture consisting of 40\% methane and 60\% argon. Although we cannot rule out an argon-rich surface, it seems more likely that nitrogen is the dominant species on Eris because the nitrogen ice 2.15 μm band is seen in spectra of Pluto and Triton.}

	abstract = {Polar ice cores contain, in trapped air bubbles, an archive of the concentrations of stable atmospheric gases. Of the major non-CO2 greenhouse gases, methane is measured quite routinely, while nitrous oxide is more challenging, with some artefacts occurring in the ice and so far limited interpretation. In the recent past, the ice cores provide the only direct measure of the changes that have occurred during the industrial period; they show that the current concentration of methane in the atmosphere is far outside the range experienced in the last 650 000 years; nitrous oxide is also elevated above its natural levels. There is controversy about whether changes in the pre-industrial Holocene are natural or anthropogenic in origin. Changes in wetland emissions are generally cited as the main cause of the large glacial{\textendash}interglacial change in methane. However, changing sinks must also be considered, and the impact of possible newly described sources evaluated. Recent isotopic data appear to finally rule out any major impact of clathrate releases on methane at these time-scales. Any explanation must take into account that, at the rapid Dansgaard{\textendash}Oeschger warmings of the last glacial period, methane rose by around half its glacial{\textendash}interglacial range in only a few decades. The recent EPICA Dome C (Antarctica) record shows that methane tracked climate over the last 650 000 years, with lower methane concentrations in glacials than interglacials, and lower concentrations in cooler interglacials than in warmer ones. Nitrous oxide also shows Dansgaard{\textendash}Oeschger and glacial{\textendash}interglacial periodicity, but the pattern is less clear.},

abstract  ={The classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory of colloids{,} and corresponding theories of electrolytes{,} are unable to explain ion specific forces between colloidal particles quantitatively. The same is true generally{,} for surfactant aggregates{,} lipids{,} proteins{,} for zeta and membrane potentials and in adsorption phenomena. Even with fitting parameters the theory is not predictive. The classical theories of interactions begin with continuum solvent electrostatic (double layer) forces. Extensions to include surface hydration are taken care of with concepts like inner and outer Helmholtz planes{,} and {"}dressed{"} ion sizes. The opposing quantum mechanical attractive forces (variously termed van der Waals{,} Hamaker{,} Lifshitz{,} dispersion{,} nonelectrostatic forces) are treated separately from electrostatic forces. The ansatz that separates electrostatic and quantum forces can be shown to be thermodynamically inconsistent. Hofmeister or specific ion effects usually show up above [approximate]10-2 molar salt. Parameters to accommodate these in terms of hydration and ion size had to be invoked{,} specific to each case. Ionic dispersion forces{,} between ions and solvent{,} for ion-ion and ion-surface interactions are not explicit in classical theories that use {"}effective{"} potentials. It can be shown that the missing ionic quantum fluctuation forces have a large role to play in specific ion effects{,} and in hydration. In a consistent predictive theory they have to be included at the same level as the nonlinear electrostatic forces that form the skeletal framework of standard theory. This poses a challenge. The challenges go further than academic theory and have implications for the interpretation and meaning of concepts like pH{,} buffers and membrane potentials{,} and for their experimental interpretation. In this article we overview recent quantitative developments in our evolving understanding of the theoretical origins of specific ion{,} or Hofmeister effects. These are demonstrated through an analysis that incorporates nonelectrostatic ion-surface and ion-ion dispersion interactions. This is based on ab initio ionic polarisabilities{,} and finite ion sizes quantified through recent ab initio work. We underline the central role of ionic polarisabilities and of ion size in the nonelectrostatic interactions that involve ions{,} solvent molecules and interfaces. Examples of mechanisms through which they operate are discussed in detail. An ab initio hydration model that accounts for polarisabilities of the tightly held hydration shell of {"}cosmotropic{"} ions is introduced. It is shown how Hofmeister effects depend on an interplay between specific surface chemistry{,} surface charge density{,} pH{,} buffer{,} and counterion with polarisabilities and ion size. We also discuss how the most recent theories on surface hydration combined with hydrated nonelectrostatic potentials may predict experimental zeta potentials and hydration forces.}}

  abstract={Premelting of ice within pores in earth materials is shown to depend on the presence of vapor layers. For thick vapor layers between ice and pore surfaces, a nanosized water sheet can be formed due to repulsive Lifshitz forces. In the absence of vapor layers, ice is inhibited from melting near pore surfaces. In between these limits, we find an enhancement of the water film thickness in silica and alumina pores. In the presence of metallic surface patches in the pore, the Lifshitz forces can dramatically widen the water film thickness, with potential complete melting of the ice surface.}

abstract = "In the next ten years, a number of studies on the carbonate system are planned as part of the JGOFS/WOCE programs. The carbon dioxide system will be studied by measuring at least two of the controlling parameters; pH, total alkalinity (TA), total inorganic CO2 (TCO2), and the fugacity of CO2 (fCO2). The other parameters can be calculated using thermodynamic relations. In the present paper the thermodynamic equations necessary to characterize the CO2 system in the oceans as a function of salinity and temperature are given. This includes equations for the dissociation of carbonic acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, silicic acid, water, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia in seawater as a function of temperature (0 to 45°C) and salinity (0 to 45). The equations are of the form ln Ki = A + BT + C ln T, where A, B, and C are functions of salinity. Equations are also given for calculating the effect of temperature and salinity on the fugacity and pH of seawater using the carbonic acid constants of Roy et al. (1993a)."
