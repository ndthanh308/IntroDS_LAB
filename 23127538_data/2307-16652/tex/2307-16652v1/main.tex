%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING STYLE RESTRICTIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  1. There are no new tags.  Existing LaTeX tags have been formatted to match
%%     the Preprint series style.
%%
%%  2. Do not change the margins or page size!  Do not change from the default
%%     text font!
%%
%%  3. You must use \cite in the text to mark your reference citations and
%%     \bibitem in the listing of references at the end of your chapter. See
%%     the examples in the following file. If you are using BibTeX, please
%%     supply the bst file with the manuscript file.
%%
%%  4. This macro is set up for two levels of headings (\section and
%%     \subsection). The macro will automatically number the headings for you.
%%
%%  5. No running heads are to be used for this volume.
%%
%%  6. Theorems, Lemmas, Definitions, Equations, etc. are to be double numbered,
%%     indicating the section and the occurrence of that element
%%     within that section. (For example, the first theorem in the second
%%     section would be numbered 2.1. The macro will
%%     automatically do the numbering for you.
%%
%%  7. Figures and Tables must be single-numbered.
%%     Use existing LaTeX tags for these elements.
%%     Numbering will be done automatically.
%%
%%  8. Page numbering is no longer included in this macro.
%%     Pagination will be set by the program committee.

\begin{abstract} \small\baselineskip=9pt
In this work, we design, analyze, and optimize sequential and shared-memory parallel algorithms for partitioned local depths (PaLD).
Given a set of data points and pairwise distances, PaLD is a method for identifying strength of pairwise relationships based on relative distances, enabling the identification of strong ties within dense and sparse communities even if their sizes and within-community absolute distances vary greatly.
We design two algorithmic variants that perform community structure analysis through triplet comparisons of pairwise distances.
We present theoretical analyses of computation and communication costs and prove that the sequential algorithms are communication optimal, up to constant factors.
We introduce performance optimization strategies that yield sequential speedups of up to $29\times$ over a baseline sequential implementation and parallel speedups of up to $19.4\times$ over optimized sequential implementations using up to $32$ threads on an Intel multicore CPU.
