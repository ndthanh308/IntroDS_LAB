% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
%
    Tidal dissipation in binary systems is the primary source for
    synchronization and circularization of the objects in the system. The
    efficiency of the dissipation of tidal energy inside stars or planets
    results in significant changes in observed properties of the binary system
    and is often studied empirically using a parameter, commonly known as the
    modified tidal quality factor ($\Q$). Though often assumed constant, in
    general that parameter will depend on the particular tidal wave experiencing
    the dissipation and the properties of the tidally distorted object. In this
    work we study the frequency dependence of $\Q$ for Sun-like stars. We
    parameterize $\Q$ as a saturating power-law in tidal frequency and obtain
    constraints using the stellar rotation period of 70 eclipsing binaries
    observed by Kepler. We use Bayesian analysis to account for the
    uncertainties in the observational data required for tidal evolution. Our
    analysis shows that $\Q$ is well constrained for tidal periods $ > 15$\,
    days, with a value of $\Q\sim10^8$ for periods $> 30$\,days and a slight
    suggested decrease at shorter periods. For tidal periods $< 15$\,days,
    $\Q$ is no longer tightly constrained, allowing for a broad range of
    possible values that overlaps with the constraints obtained using tidal
    circularization in binaries, which point to much more efficient dissipation:
    $\Q\sim10^6$.
