    \caption{Inspired by the gradual nature of the diffusion process along a diffusion {\bf time-axis} (left), our approach (right) entangles the {\bf temporal-axis} of motion with the time-axis of the diffusion process (right), enabling a new mechanism for synthesizing arbitrarily long motion sequences.  }
