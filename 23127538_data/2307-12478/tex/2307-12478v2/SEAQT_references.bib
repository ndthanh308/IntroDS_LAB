	abstract = {In the present study, n-type (Bi2Se3)x(Bi2Te3)1-x crystals with various chemical compositions were fabricated by the zone melting method. Thermoelectric properties, including Seebeck coefficient (α), electrical conductivity (σ) and thermal conductivity (κ), were measured in the temperature range of 300-500 K. The influence of the variations of Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 content on thermoelectric properties was studied. The increase of Bi2Se3 content (x) caused an increase in carrier concentration and thus an increase of σ and a decrease of α. The maximum figure of merit (ZT = α2σT/κ) of 0.87 was obtained at about 325 K for the composition of 93\%Bi2Te3-7\%Bi2Se3 with doping TeI4.},

We systematically study how the electronic properties and elastic constants of UC are affected by the different choice of U as well as the exchangecorrelation potential. We show that by choosing an appropriate Hubbard U parameter within the GGA + U approach, most of our calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental data. Therefore, the results obtained by the GGA + U with effective Hubbard parameter U chosen around 3 eV for UC are considered to be reasonable.},

	abstract = {To understand the thermal behavior of superhard uranium carbide (UC), in the present work thermodynamic properties of UC in rock-salt structure are investigated using first-principles plane-wave pseudopotential method within the density functional theory. Thermodynamic functions such as specific heat, entropy, internal energy and enthalpy as a function of temperature have been calculated using the phonon dispersion curves and phonon density of states within quasi-harmonic approximation. The variation of lattice specific heat with temperature is also compared with available experimental data. The dependence of selected observations of UC compounds on the effective U parameter has also been investigated. The DFT + U calculation is performed in order to describe precisely the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion incorporation of Hubbard parameter U = 3.0 eV that leads to better comparison of lattice parameter and elastic constants with experimental and available theoretical data. The calculated phonon frequencies and elastic constants show that the UC in rock-salt structure is dynamically and mechanically stable at ambient condition as indicated by their positive values. The temperature dependence of thermal and electrical conductivities has also been calculated and compared with the available experimental data and discussed. The possible use of UC in thermoelectric devices using thermal conductivity and resistivity is also discussed, and the present study suggests that the UC can be a potential candidate for the thermoelectric application at higher temperatures. We hope that the present study should stimulate further studies of this material.},

	abstract = {Nuclear design and neutronic analysis of thermal neutron reactor need high reliable thermal neutron cross sections. Uranium mononitride (UN) is a candidate fuel material for advanced power reactor with its better thermodynamics and accident tolerance. However, in thermal neutron region, reliable thermal neutron scattering cross sections are lacked for UN, which is disadvantageous to reactor physics simulations. The scattering law of the UN fuel material may impact the thermal neutron spectrum and criticality of the reactor systems. Neutron cross sections in thermal range are correlated with energy, temperature, physical and chemical properties of the scattering medium, reflecting the phonon spectra of material itself. In this paper, based on the ab initio method of quantum mechanics, phonon density of states in UN are calculated by VASP/PHONON code, and used for integral to obtain UN heat capacity at a constant volume. Adopting this new phonon density of states, NJOY/LEAPR code is used to generate S (, ) data by thermal neutron scattering theory and NJOY/THERMR utilizes these data to produce thermal scattering matrix in order to investigate thermal kernel effect of UN. Subsequently, thermal neutron scattering cross sections of UN are generated with NJOY code system. Comparison with uranium dioxide (UO2) in the traditional PWR is done. Results indicate that optimized lattice parameter are in good agreement with the database; the optical modes are well separated from the acoustic modes compared with UO2; heat capacity at a constant volume is consistent with experimental value; the inelastic and elastic cross sections of 238U in UN are lower than those of 238U in UO2. N in UN only deals with incoherent part in elastic cross sections. As the temperature increases, elastic cross sections of UN decrease while inelastic ones increase, and cross sections approach to free atom cross section at high energies. Considering the limitations of 14N, the scattering law and inelastic scattering cross sections are also under investigation using 15N in UN compound. This paper's conclusion fulfill the vacancy of thermal neutron scattering cross sections of UN, which laid a foundation for systematic study on the neutronics properties of UN fuel in the light water reactors as well as for the design of new neutron moderators and neutron filer.},

The thermal conductivity of UB2 and ZrB2 is calculated through atomic scale modelling methods.

Our results show that by choosing the Hubbard U around 2 eV within the GGA+U approach, it is promising to correctly and consistently describe the above mentioned properties of UN. The localization behavior of 5f electrons is found to be stronger than that of UC and our electronic analysis indicates that the effective charge of UN can be represented as U1.71+N1.71À. As for the thermodynamic study, the phonon dispersion illustrates the stability of UN and we further predict the lattice vibration energy, thermal expansion, and speciﬁc heat by utilizing the quasiharmonic approximation.

However, relatively little research has focused on γ-(U,Zr) alloys due to their instability at room temperature. The effect of Zr composition on its mechanical properties is not clear yet. Herein, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanical and dynamical stabilities of γ-(U,Zr) alloys under high temperatures, and we calculate the corresponding lattice constants, various elastic moduli, Vickers hardness, Debye temperature, and dynamical structure factor. The results showed that γ-U, β-Zr, and γ-(U,Zr) are all mechanically and dynamically stable at 1200 K, which is in good agreement with the previously reported high-temperature phase diagram of U-Zr alloys. We found that the alloying treatment on γ-U with Zr can effectively improve its mechanical strength and melting points, such as Vickers hardness and Debye temperature, making it more suitable for nuclear reactors. Furthermore, the Zr concentrations in γ-(U,Zr) alloys have an excellent effect on these properties. In addition, the dynamical structure factor reveals that γ-U shows different structural features after alloying with Zr. The present simulation data and insights could be significant for understanding the structures and properties of UZr alloy under high temperatures.},

The first method has been developed by the team at the University of Wisconsin Madison. They developed a practical and general modeling approach for thermal conductivity of metals and metal alloys that integrates ab-initio and semiempirical physics-based models to maximize the strengths of both techniques. The second method has been developed by the team at Virginia Tech. This approach consists of a determining the thermal conductivity using only ab-initio methods without any fitting parameters. Both methods were complementary. The models incorporated both phonon and electron contributions. Good agreement with experimental data over a wide temperature range were found. The models also provided insight into the different physical factors that govern the thermal conductivity under different temperatures. The models were general enough to incorporate more complex effects like additional alloying species, defects, transmutation products and noble gas bubbles to predict the behavior of complex metallic alloys like U-alloy fuel systems under burnup.},

Thermal conductivity also increases abruptly upon uranium undergoing structural modiﬁcation from ambient temperature orthorhombic phase to high temperature cubic phase. Observed differences in results obtained in present investigation from those reported in literature have been explained on the basis of non-metallic impurity contents and inherent structural anisotropy of uranium. It has been suggested that structural anisotropy, which strongly affects metal’s microstructure; also notably inﬂuences the heat transport properties. High temperature body centred cubic phase (BCC) of uranium shows very high heat conductivity (44 W/m.K at 1075 K), which afﬁrms the advantage of cubic-phase uranium alloys as potential metallic nuclear fuel.

	abstract = {Phonon density of states (PDOS) measurements have been performed on polycrystalline UO2 at 295 and 1200 K using time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering to investigate the impact of anharmonicity on the vibrational spectra and to benchmark ab initio PDOS simulations performed on this strongly correlated Mott-insulator. Time-of-flight PDOS measurements include anharmonic linewidth broadening inherently and the factor of {\textasciitilde} 7 enhancement of the oxygen spectrum relative to the uranium component by the neutron weighting increases sensitivity to the oxygen-dominated optical phonon modes. The first-principles simulations of quasi-harmonic PDOS spectra were neutron-weighted and anharmonicity was introduced in an approximate way by convolution with wavevector-weighted averages over our previously measured phonon linewidths for UO2 that are provided in numerical form. Comparisons between the PDOS measurements and the simulations show reasonable agreement overall, but they also reveal important areas of disagreement for both high and low temperatures. The discrepancies stem largely from an {\textasciitilde} 10 meV compression in the overall bandwidth (energy range) of the oxygen-dominated optical phonons in the simulations. A similar linewidth-convoluted comparison performed with the PDOS spectrum of Dolling et al. obtained by shell-model fitting to their historical phonon dispersion measurements shows excellent agreement with the time-of-flight PDOS measurements reported here. In contrast, we show by comparisons of spectra in linewidth-convoluted form that recent first-principles simulations for UO2 fail to account for the PDOS spectrum determined from the measurements of Dolling et al. These results demonstrate PDOS measurements to be stringent tests for ab initio simulations of phonon physics in UO2 and they indicate further the need for advances in theory to address lattice dynamics of UO2.},

	abstract = {Thermal transport in nuclear fuels used for nuclear energy applications is directly tied to performance and reliability. Uranium dioxide (UO2), one of the most important nuclear fuels, can accumulate excess oxygen atoms as interstitial defects, which significantly impacts thermal transport properties. In this study, thermal conductivities and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on UO2+x were performed at low temperatures (2–300 K). The thermal conductivity of UO2+x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.11) is significantly suppressed compared to UO2 except near the Néel temperature TN = 30.8 K, where it is independent of x. INS measurements demonstrate that the heat capacities and phonon group velocities of UO2 and UO2.08 are similar, and the suppressed thermal conductivity results from smaller phonon lifetimes. These perceptions advance our understanding of thermal transport properties in advanced nuclear fuels and guide safe and economic utilization of nuclear energy.},

Unfortunately, these assets often come with the uncertainty of whether the observed mechanisms are based on realistic physical phenomena or whether they are artifacts of the employed material models. One such example is the often reported occurrence of stable planar faults (PFs) in body-centered cubic (bcc) metals subjected to high strains, e.g., at crack tips or in strained nano-objects. In this paper, we study the strain dependence of the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) of \{110\} planes in various bcc metals with material models of increasing sophistication, i.e., (modified) embedded atom method, angular-dependent, Tersoff, and bond-order potentials as well as density functional theory. We show that under applied tensile strains the GSFE curves of many classical potentials exhibit a local minimum which gives rise to the formation of stable PFs. These PFs do not appear when more sophisticated material models are used and have thus to be regarded as artifacts of the potentials. We demonstrate that the local GSFE minimum is not formed for reasons of symmetry and we recommend including the determination of the strain-dependent (110) GSFE as a benchmark for newly developed potentials.},

The computed interaction energies are expected to facilitates the nucleation of double kinks in close proximity to each other and to pre-existing kinks, thus promoting clustering of double kinks on screw segments and of ‘daughter’ double kinks ahead of ‘mother’ kinks.

The model is demonstrated using U-Zr and U-Mo alloys and displays good agreement with experimental data, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of about 1.3 W/m-K ({\textasciitilde}10\% error against experimental data) over the typical operating temperature range for all phases of U-Zr. This model delivers the same level of accuracy as existing models for U-Zr and U-Mo, along with the same (or fewer) number of fitting parameters. More importantly, all the fitting parameters have clear physical meaning, providing significant insights into the physics of various electron- and phonon-scattering mechanisms and enabling predictions regarding the thermal conductivities in alloys, with a reduced reliance on experimental data.},

	abstract = {Nanoporous gold (np-Au) differs from its macroporous counterparts through its ligament and pore length scales, its high relative density, and its very distinct mesoscale cellular architecture. When reexamining the applicability of conventional macroporous foam scaling laws to np-Au, difficulties persist not only in determining the solid properties of nanoscale ligaments, but also because np-Au structure is not self-similar as the relative density changes. Thus, a clear distinction of the effects of relative density and structure is required. This paper aims to capture the role of topology and morphology into the scaling laws by comparing the overall mechanical response of real np-Au structures with the behavior of spinodal and gyroid structures. Quantitative morphological and topological characterization of these structures has been carried out and their role on the macroscopic elastoplastic response of np-Au has been studied using finite element (FE) simulations. The predicted elastic modulus of real np-Au structures from FE simulations is in remarkable agreement with the nanoindentation measurements, and validates the numerical simulations. Quantitative structural analysis reveals that np-Au and spinodal structures are topologically very distinct, but similar in their morphology. On the other hand, gyroids are both morphologically and topologically very distinct from np-Au. The results suggest that the macroscopic stiffness and strength are highly sensitive to the topology, while being relatively much less sensitive to the morphology. The effects of structural topology are captured into modified scaling laws where the geometric pre-factors for the stiffness and strength are found to vary linearly with the scaled genus.},

A recently proposed model based on a microstructure consisting of four-coordinated spherical nodes interconnected by cylindrical struts, whose node positions are randomly displaced from the lattice points of a diamond cubic lattice, was extended. This was done by including the increased density as result of the introduced structural disorder. Scaling equations for the elastic Poisson's ratio, the Young's modulus and the yield strength were determined as functions of the structural disorder and the solid fraction. The extended model was applied to identify the elastic–plastic behavior of the solid phase of nanoporous gold. It was found, that the elastic Poisson's ratio provides a robust basis for the calibration of the structural disorder. Based on this approach, a systematic study of the size effect on the yield strength was performed and the results were compared to experimental data provided in literature. An excellent agreement with recently published results for polymer infiltrated samples of nanoporous gold with varying ligament size was found.},

Over the entire surface, Pt is found to not possess well-defined local maxima or minima, suggesting spreading in favor of dissociation of the dislocation core, unlike the other seven metals. Our calculations also reveal that at a large ⟨112⟩ displacement, where atoms on two \{111\} adjacent planes are aligned, an anomalous local minimum occurs for Ir and Rh. The oddity is explained by relatively large, localized atomic displacements that take place in the two metals to accommodate the alignment that do not occur in the other six metals. In addition to the fully calculated surfaces, we characterize a continuous 11-term Fourier-series function, which provides a particularly excellent representation of the GSFE surfaces for Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, and Pd.},

We find a strong effect of surface orientation on dislocation nucleation in tungsten nanowires, in which \{111\} surfaces act as favorite sites under high strain. While dislocation activities in a localized region give rise to an initially thin shear band, self-catalyzed stress concentration and dislocation nucleation at shear band interfaces cause a discrete thickening of shear band. Our findings not only advance the current understanding of defect activities and deformation morphology of BCC nanowires, but also shed light on the deformation dynamics in other microscopic crystals where jerky motion of deformation band is observed.},

	abstract = {The mechanical properties and plastic deformation of a Cu55.4Zr35.2Al7.5Y1.9 nanoporous metallic glass (MG) have been studied using depth-sensing nanoindentation combined with electron microscopy characterization. The nanoporous MG exhibits an initial relative density of 50.9\% and a bicontinuous structure with 20.84 ± 1.49 nm-diameter interconnecting ligaments. It is brittle in tension, whereas it has significant homogeneous plasticity under compression. It has a hardness of 0.67 ± 0.06 GPa and Young's modulus of 14.72 ± 0.74 GPa from nanoindentation. While under tensile and compression, it has a yield strength of 0.22 to 0.23 GPa and an effective modulus of 10.37 ± 0.99 GPa. The discrepancy between the moduli is caused by irreversible shear transformation zone (STZ) plasticity that takes place well ahead of the yield point. The deformation in the nanoporous MG begins with both elastic and plastic bending in ligaments and transfers to plastic uniaxial deformation in ligaments at a critical strain near 0.03, at which a significant change in stiffness is observed. The yielding stress follows the universal scaling law predicted by the critical-like behavior in glassy systems. The strength to modulus ratio is well maintained in this nanoporous MG and is higher than the porous crystalline alloys. Our experimental study clarifies the fundamental failure mechanism and deformation behavior in nanoporous MGs.},

	abstract = {As temperature increases, the thermal vacancy concentration in pure metals dramatically increases and causes some strongly non-linear thermodynamic behaviors in pure metals when close to their melting points. In this paper, we chose body-centered cubic (bcc) W as the target and presented a thermodynamic model to account for its Gibbs energy of pure bcc W from 0 K to melting point by including the contribution of thermal vacancy. A new formula for interaction part was proposed for describing the quadratic temperature behavior of vacancy formation energy. Based on the experimental/first-principles computed thermodynamic properties, all the parameters in the Gibbs energy function were assessed by following the proposed two-step optimization strategy. The thermodynamic behaviors, i.e., the strong nonlinear increase for temperature dependence of heat capacities at high temperatures and a nonlinear Arrhenius plot of vacancy concentration, in bcc W can be well reproduced by the obtained Gibbs energy. The successful description of thermal vacancy on such strongly non-linear thermodynamic behaviors in bcc W indicates that the presently proposed thermodynamic model and optimization strategy should be universal ones and are applicable to all other metals.},

The dislocations can climb as well as glide so that recovery due to dislocation rearrangement and pair annihilation proceeds quickly. Sometimes recrystallization occurs during deformation. For polycrystalline metals, grain boundary sliding and migration also play an important role. Under a very low stress, the deformation occurs not by dislocation motion, but exclusively by diffusion. In this chapter, the characteristics of high-temperature deformation are shown by using the deformation mechanism map. The problems special to high-temperature deformation, and the experimental techniques to settle them, are given to help the understanding of the deformation mechanism described in the following chapters.},

	abstract = {We present a study of the elastic and plastic behavior of nanoporous gold in compression, focusing on molecular dynamics simulation and inspecting experimental data for verification. Both approaches agree on an anomalously high elastic compliance in the early stages of deformation, along with a quasi immediate onset of plastic yielding even at the smallest load. Already before the first loading, the material undergoes spontaneous plastic deformation under the action of the capillary forces, requiring no external load. Plastic deformation under compressive load is accompanied by dislocation storage and dislocation interaction, along with strong strain hardening. Dislocation-starvation scenarios are not supported by our results. The stiffness increases during deformation, but never approaches the prediction by the relevant Gibson–Ashby scaling law. Microstructural disorder affects the plastic deformation behavior and surface excess elasticity might modify elastic response, yet we relate the anomalous compliance and the immediate yield onset to an atomistic origin: the large surface-induced prestress induces elastic shear that brings some regions in the material close to the shear instability of the generalized stacking fault energy curve. These regions are elastically highly compliant and plastically weak.},

The ligament size can reach down to the very limits of stability of nanoscale objects. The processes by which nanoporous metals are formed have continued to be fascinating, even though their study in relation to surface treatment, metal refinement, and failure mechanisms can be traced back to ancient times. In fact, the prospect of using alloy corrosion as a means of making nanomaterials for fundamental studies and functional applications has led to a revived interest in the process. The quite distinct mechanical properties of nanoporous metals are one of the focus points of this interest, as relevant studies probe the deformation behavior of crystals at the lower end of the size scale. Furthermore, the coupling of bulk stress and strain to the forces acting along the surface of nanoporous metals provide unique opportunities for controlling the mechanical behavior through external variables such as the electrical or chemical potentials.},

However, it is not yet possible to directly observe dislocation motion experimentally at the atomic level. Here, we present the first observations of the long-hypothesized kink-pair mechanism in action using atomistic simulations of dislocation motion in iron. In a striking deviation from the classical picture, dislocation motion at high strain rates becomes rough, resulting in spontaneous self-pinning and production of large quantities of debris. Then, at still higher strain rates, the dislocation stops abruptly and emits a twin plate that immediately takes over as the dominant mode of plastic deformation. These observations challenge the applicability of the Peierls threshold concept to the three-dimensional motion of screw dislocations at high strain rates, and suggest a new interpretation of plastic strength and microstructure of shocked metals.},

The large surface-area-to-volume ratio exhibited by nanoporous materials provides an unsaturable sink with the potential to continuously remove both point defects and He. This property enhances the possibilities for these materials to be tailored for high radiation-damage resistance. In order to explore the potential effect of this on the individual ligaments of nanoporous materials, we present results on the response of tungsten (W) nanoparticles (NPs) to 15 keV He ion irradiation. Tungsten foils and various sizes of NPs were ion irradiated concurrently and imaged in-situ via transmission electron microscopy at 750 °C. Helium bubbles were not observed in NPs with diameters less than 20 nm but did form in larger NPs and the foils. No dislocation loops or black spot damage were observed in any NPs up to 100 nm in diameter but were found to accumulate in the W foils. These results indicate that a nanoporous material, particularly one made up of ligaments with characteristic dimensions of 30 nm or less, is likely to exhibit significant resistance to He accumulation and structural damage and, therefore, be highly tolerant to radiation.},

Here, we used this novel method to create nanoporous gold particles with controlled ligament sizes by changing the initial sample's relative concentrations of gold and germanium. When investigated over 1–4 h at 250–400 °C the material was thermally stable up to 350 °C, which is higher than the thermal stability of “classical” nanoporous gold prepared by dealloying. Mechanical properties were examined utilizing nanoindentation of nanoporous gold before and after annealing. For smaller ligament sizes, hardness increased with annealing temperature up to 300 °C and then strongly decreased. For larger ligament sizes, hardness decreased with increasing annealing temperature. Young's modulus was unchanged up to 300 °C.},

	abstract = {Tungsten is a promising plasma facing material for fusion reactors. Despite many favorable properties, helium ions incoming from the plasma are known to dramatically affect the microstructure of tungsten, leading to bubble growth, blistering, and/or to the formation of fuzz. In order to develop mitigation strategies, it is essential to understand the atomistic processes that lead to bubble formation and subsequent microstructural changes. In this work, we use large-scale Accelerated Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate small (N = 1,2) VNHeMvacancy/helium complexes, which serve as the nuclei for larger helium bubble growth, over timescales reaching into the milliseconds under conditions typical of the operation of fusion reactors. These complexes can interconvert between different ILVN+LHeMvariants via Frenkel pair nucleation (leading to the creation of a additional vacancy/interstitial pair) and annihilation events; sequences of these events can lead to net migration of these embryonic bubbles. The competition between nucleation and annihilation produces a very complex dependence of the diffusivity on the number of heliums. Finally, through cluster dynamics simulations, we show that diffusion of these complexes provides an efficient pathway for helium release at fluxes expected in fusion reactors, and hence that accounting for the mobility of these complexes is crucial.},

Uniaxial deformation of a W bulk single crystal is also investigated for reference. Our results reveal a strong tension–compression asymmetry in both the stress–strain response and the deformation behavior due to different yielding/failure modes: while the nanowires fail by brittle fracture under tensile loading, they yield by nucleation of dislocations from the wire surface under compressive loading. It is found that (1) nanowires have a higher strength than the bulk single crystal; (2) with a cross-sectional size larger than 10 nm, there exists a weak dependence of strength on wire size; (3) when the wire size is equal to or smaller than 10 nm, nanowires buckle under compressive loading; (4) the cross-sectional shape, strain rate, and crystallographic orientations of the lateral surfaces affect the strength and the site of defect initiation but not the overall deformation behavior.},

	abstract = {Impurities acting as traps reduce the self-interstitial atom (SIA) cluster mobility, thereby increasing recombination and, in turn, enhancing radiation-resistance of polycrystalline materials. However, at elevated temperatures, depending on SIA-trap (impurity) binding energy, SIA clusters may trap and detrap (detach) numerous times. In tungsten, SIA clusters of all sizes glide one-dimensionally (1D) along their Burgers vector direction. This can result in detrapped SIA clusters to retrace their original 1D path, confining their 1D-glide between traps. However, SIA clusters can change the direction of their 1D-glide by overcoming a rotation barrier and impurities or solutes are known to reduce this barrier. A lower rotation barrier can result in detrapped SIA clusters to diffuse in a random 1D direction, effectively leading to 3D (net-3D) diffusion. Here we investigate the effect of two cases of SIA diffusion, namely the confined-1D diffusion and the net-3D diffusion, on the damage accumulation in polycrystalline tungsten under 14 MeV neutron irradiation using the object kinetic Monte Carlo method. Simulations were performed using cascade debris obtained from molecular dynamics simulations with primary knock-on atom (PKA) energies corresponding to 14 MeV neutrons. In the simulations with net-3D diffusion, SIA clusters of all sizes diffuse in a random 1D direction after the clusters detrap. While for the confined 1D diffusion case, clusters larger than size 5 retain their original direction of 1D glide. In both types of simulations, trapped vacancies are assumed to be permanently immobilized. Unexpectedly, the damage accumulation was lower with confined 1D diffusion than that with net-3D. We present a systematic comparison of the influence of the two cases of SIA diffusion on the radiation damage accumulation as a function of dose rate, detrapping barrier, and impurity concentration at 1025 K.},

	abstract = {We present an elaborate study of the surface and size effects on the transient and steady-state behaviors of point defects in irradiated solids. In this investigation, both pure Ni and binary Ni-Cr were utilized as model systems. We utilize the spatially-resolved rate-theory (SRRT) modeling approach, and directly account for the effects of dose rate, production bias, and defects recombination, reactions with volumetric sinks, and diffusion to surface sinks. Several simulations were conducted to investigate the effects of these parameters in both coupled and decoupled manners. In the presence of production bias, the effects of surface and size persist even as the surface to volume ratio decreases. This was associated with a surface-induced and size-regulated instability. This instability is only triggered above a critical size between 100 and 500 nm. The critical size decreases with increasing dose rate, increasing production bias, or lowering the temperature. Moreover, this instability results in a pattern that favors the separation of vacancies and interstitials. Once this pattern develops, anomalies in the dependence on size for the transient and steady-state concentrations of point defects and the surface/boundary sink strength are observed. These anomalies tend to render irradiation damage more severe. For pure Ni, it was shown that vacancy supersaturation increases with size, and the rate of increase also rises with size. For the binary Ni-Cr system, it was shown that the magnitude of enrichment/depletion of Ni/Cr at the boundary increases with size, and the width of the enrichment/depletion layer also increases with size. The results obtained here agree well with experimental observations in irradiated materials such as the formation of void denuded zones adjacent to grain boundaries and the size and temperature dependence of the radiation resistance of nanomaterials. The size-dependent behaviors reported here also shed new light on the radiation tolerance of nanomaterials, i.e., the irradiation-induced instabilities are suppressed in such materials. Lastly, the implications of the results obtained here on the development of efficient reduced order models or the utilization of ion irradiation as a surrogate to neutron irradiation are discussed.},

	abstract = {Irradiation induces significant changes in the microstructure of structural materials, many of which are driven by the preferential capture of point defects at particular sinks, such as dislocations. To quantify the kinetics of defect absorption at sinks, theoretical models of radiation damage generally rely on the concept of sink strength. However, analytical approaches to estimating the sink strength of dislocations rely, in turn, on a series of geometrical assumptions, idealizing the dislocation network as a series of infinite straight dislocations or isolated loops, often with artificial boundary conditions. In this paper, we use a recently developed technique to quantify point defect capture in three-dimensional dislocation networks. We integrate this technique with discrete dislocation dynamics to analyze the sink strengths of realistic dislocation microstructures consisting of a mixture of edge, screw, and junction segments, complete with an accurate description of the strain fields these microstructures produce and the resultant energetic interactions experienced by point defects. We show that the effective kinetics for absorbing point defects can vary significantly with the arrangement of the microstructure with a strong dependence on the structure and character of its dislocation content and introduce a surrogate model for sink strength which incorporates these effects.},

	abstract = {Tungsten is the front-runner candidate for building the plasma-facing armour components for future fusion reactors. However, in-service irradiation by fusion-neutrons and helium will create lattice-defects in the material, compromising its properties and lifetime. Improving the component’s resilience to radiation damage and accurately predicting the lifetime of irradiated components is key for commercial feasibility of the reactor. For this purpose, understanding the creation and evolution of radiation damage is essential. This paper reviews recent advances in characterising radiation damage through experimental and modelling techniques. Tungsten-ion- and helium-ion-implantation are commonly used to mimic the damage created by neutron- and helium-irradiation respectively. Defects ({\textgreater} 1.5 nm) can be directly imaged using transmission electron microscopy while all defects (size-independent), may be indirectly probed by measuring lattice strains induced by them (using diffraction techniques; synchrotron X-rays or high-resolution electron-backscatter). Neutron-irradiation produces mainly ½〈111〉 prismatic loops. Loop-interaction and structural organisation evolves with changing implantation dose and temperature. Helium-irradiation, {\textless} 573 K, induces formation of small helium-vacancy clusters, which evolve into bubbles, blisters and “fuzz” structure with changing temperature and dose. Nano-indentation or micro-cantilever bending tests can be used to examine mechanical properties of ion-implanted layers. Both helium- and neutron-implantation defects induce increased hardening often followed by subsequent strain-softening and localised deformation. Such irradiation-induced alterations are detrimental to material ductility and long-term structural integrity of tungsten-based components. Development of physically-based material models that capture the physics of underlying irradiation-induced changes, inspire confidence of reliably using simulations to predict mechanical behaviour and in-service performance of irradiated engineering components in future.},

Tungsten is considered as a plasma facing material for a fusion reactor. The effect of fusion neutron impact is simulated by surrogate irradiations with high-energy ions. The primary defects at 1-100 dpa were produced in tungsten samples by He and C ions accelerated in the Kurchatov cyclotron to 3-10 MeV at the total fluence of 1017-1019 cm-2. The irradiated material was studied in deuterium plasma on the LENTA linear divertor simulator at the plasma fluence 1021-1022 D/cm2. Erosion dynamics, development of the surface microstructure and deuterium retention were analyzed. Increased deuterium retention detected previously in tungsten pre-irradiated by He ions was also registered (ERDA) on C-irradiated samples at 2-3 dpa. In contrast, a significant decrease in the D uptake has been observed on those samples operated in the experiments at 500°C.},

	abstract = {Tungsten is one of the prime candidates for a first-wall material near the divertor area due to its high temperature strength, high thermal conductivity, low erosion rate and low tritium retention. The erosion resistance of tungsten to the edge plasmas and transient events are carefully investigated in a simulated fusion environment. Here, we use the dense plasma focus (DPF) device operated in a D2 as a source for pulsed fusion plasma. The tungsten (α-W) substrates with a preferential growth direction along (110) plane were used. These pristine-W samples were nanostructurized using a (i) low-temperature continuous nitrogen RF plasma system and (ii) coated with 60 nm tungsten film, using high-temperature argon plasma in a dense plasma focus (DPF) device. The low- temperature plasma treatment created mesh-like porous nanostructure on the surface of pristine-W with change in crystalline orientation to (200), while the DPF-based deposition resulted in a nanocrystal (30–50 nm) decorated surface with enhanced (200) orientation. The crack propagation and bubble formation during DPF D2 plasma exposure were significantly controlled by the surface modification of tungsten. The mesh-like structure was modified to form loosely bound spherical nanoparticles, while the nanocrystals remained tightly bound and grew in size with D2 plasma exposure. The better adhesion of the nanocrystals and controlled growth along the (200) direction resulted in least change in hardness measurements for the nanocrystal decorated samples. Thus, nanocrystal decoration of tungsten with a preferential growth direction of (200) can help reduce the fusion-induced damage in first-wall materials.},

Environmental and safety considerations impose several additional restrictions on potential materials systems, but reduced-activation ferritic/martensitic steels (including thermomechanically treated and oxide dispersion–strengthened options) and silicon carbide ceramic composites emerge as robust structural materials options. Materials modeling (including computational thermodynamics) and advanced manufacturing methods are poised to exert a major impact in the next ten years.},

The cryogenic plant and the magnet power supply buildings are complete, and these systems begin commissioning in 2020. The power conversion and distribution area is complete and in operation, and construction has started on the component cooling water system building. Manufacturing of the basic components of the ITER tokamak is also proceeding well. The base and lower cylinder of the cryostat have been assembled on the ITER site. The first modules of the central solenoid and of the six poloidal field coils have been wound. The first winding packs of the toroidal field magnets are complete, as are the first casings, which have been verified to meet the high tolerances required. The first vacuum vessel sector is near completion and demonstrated to meet strict tolerances. The heating and current drive systems (neutral beams, electron cyclotron heating and ion cyclotron heating) are in the final design phase. The sequence of ITER operation from First Plasma to the achievement of the Q = 10 and Q = 5 project goals has been adapted to the Staged Approach to construction, a stepwise installation of all systems. The ITER Research Plan has been revised in 2017 to be consistent with the systems available in each phase. Physics studies focus on the disruption mitigation system, design of the ITER tungsten divertor, and modelling of ITER plasma scenarios. Modelling concentrates on the initial phases of the Research Plan and on the Q = 10 scenario, especially plasma termination.},

            In this paper, the acoustic impedance property has been employed to predict the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength (YS) of pure metals and alloys. Novel algorithms were developed, depending on three experimentally measured parameters, and programmed in a MATLAB code. The measured parameters are longitudinal wave velocity of the metal, density, and crystal structure. 19-samples were considered in the study and divided into 3-groups according to their crystal structure; 7-FCC, 6-BCC, and 6-HCB. X-ray diffraction was used to examine the crystal structure of each sample of each group, while longitudinal wave velocity and metals’ density were measured experimentally. A comparison between mechanical properties predicted by the model and the ASTM standards was done to investigate the validity of the model. Furthermore, predicted stress–strain curves were compared with corresponding curves in the pieces literature as an additional validation check. The results revealed the excellence of the model with 85–99\% prediction accuracy. The study also proved that if metals are grouped according to their crystal structure, a relation between UTS, YS, and modulus of elasticity (E) properties and wave pressure transmission coefficient (Tr) could be formulated.},

The magnitude of the yield stress is much larger in tension versus compression for very small 〈100〉 nanowires, and this asymmetry is primarily due to the effects of surface stresses and different slip systems active during tensile and compressive yielding. Nanowires with a 〈111〉 orientation only show significant tension−compression asymmetry when defects exist in the wire prior to reverse compressive loading. The predictions may explain recent measurements regarding the yield of gold nanowires (see Marszalek, P. E.; Greenleaf, W. J.; Li, H. B.; Oberhauser, A. F.; Fernandez, J. M. PNAS 2000, 97, 6282).},

	abstract = {Based on the atomistic studies presented in Part I, we develop analytical yield criteria for single crystals that capture the effect of shear stresses other than the Schmid stress (non-glide stresses) on the shear stress needed for dislocation glide (Peierls stress). These yield criteria characterize a non-associated plastic flow that originates owing to the complex response of 1/2〈111〉 screw dislocations to an applied stress tensor. Employing these criteria, we identify the operative slip systems for tensile/compressive loading along various axes within the standard stereographic triangle and determine the ensuing tension–compression asymmetry. This result is in an excellent qualitative agreement with available experimental data. Moreover, using the constructed yield criteria within the Taylor homogenization procedure, we demonstrate that effects associated with non-planar cores of screw dislocations persist in random polycrystals. This affects significantly critical phenomena such as shear localization, which is demonstrated by analyzing the cavitation in a ductile plastic solid.},

Here we develop a generalized dislocation mobility law in bcc metals, and demonstrate its use in discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DD) simulations of plastic flow in tungsten (W) micro pillars. We present the theoretical background for dislocation mobility as a motivating basis for the developed law. Analytical theory, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and experimental data are used to construct a general phenomenological description. The usefulness of the mobility law is demonstrated through its application to modeling the plastic deformation of W micro pillars. The model is consistent with experimental observations of temperature and orientation dependence of the flow stress and the corresponding dislocation microstructure.},

The NbMoTaW and NbMoTaWV RMPEA films maintained the single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structures after irradiation. The electrical and thermal conductivities did not decrease, and the phenomena like “fuzz” structures of W films or “fuzz-like” structures of NbMoTaW RMPEA bulks were not found, indicating that the nanocrystalline RMPEA films have inhibition effects on the growth of “fuzz” structures. The inhibition of “fuzz” structures in the RMPEA films could be attributed to: (i) The high-density columnar crystal grain boundaries could accommodate more helium and provide helium release channels. (ii) The sluggish diffusion kinetic effects of RMPEA films suppressed the helium diffusion and maintained the helium release channels at high temperatures. Moreover, the NbMoTaWV RMPEA films were discovered to produce smaller helium bubbles and less pronounced microcracks compared to NbMoTaW RMPEA films. It was due to the solid solution incorporation of V which further enhanced the lattice distortion and toughness as well as the profound suppression of helium diffusion.},

	abstract = {Refractory multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have attracted much attention as promising candidate materials for structural applications at elevated temperatures. Several studies have demonstrated that edge dislocation takes an important role in controlling high-temperature strength in refractory MPEAs. Here in order to understand the contribution of edge dislocation to strength, we have studied the effect of local lattice distortion on the core structure of edge dislocation in NbMoTaW MPEAs and the subsystems using atomistic simulations. We found the magnitude of lattice distortion is strongly dependent on the constituent elements and their concentrations. The lattice distortion reaches the maximum at around equiatomic composition. Binary alloys with large atomic size mismatch have a lattice distortion comparable with ternary and quaternary systems. We then have analyzed the core structure of 1/2{\textless}111{\textgreater}/\{110\} edge dislocation in NbMoTaW MPEAs and the subsystems in the framework of Peierls-Nabarro model. The dislocation core half-width decreases with increasing lattice distortion exponentially. As a consequence, the critical shear stress for dislocation motion normalized by shear modulus exhibits a linear increase as the lattice distortion increases. This may help understand the linear correlation of yield strength normalized by Young's modulus with lattice distortion in various refractory MPEAs reported in experiments. Our present work provides insights into the origin of the essential contribution of edge dislocation to strength in refractory compositional complex alloys.},

The dependence of tensile yield strength on ligament size is described well using a size-effect exponent -1.18 for four samples, whereas bulk-like behavior, i.e. no ligament-size dependency, is observed for ligament size greater than 402 nm in compression; compressive yield strength depending on ligament size is described by a size-effect exponent -1.49 for ligament sizes ranging from 56 nm to 402 nm. The asymmetries in yield strength and plasticity between tension and compression are discussed in terms of the deformation behavior of individual ligaments based on a suggested open-cell model and dislocation activities in the ligaments.},

Unfortunately, most of the investigations focus on the perspective of experiments and few are available from the perspective of atomic and electrical scale such as electronic structure, energy band structure and charge density. In present work, ﬁrst-principle calculation based on density functional theory was employed to calculate the ground state total energy, lattice parameters, elastic constants and polycrystal modulus of NbMoTaW and NbMoTaWV refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs). The effects of V addition on the phase structure, elastic properties and electronic structure of NbMoTaW-based RHEAs were studied, respectively. V addition is helpful to improve the mechanical properties of NbMoTaW alloy according to the calculated value of shear modulus to bulk modulus, Cauchy pressure and Vickers hardness. Based on calculated energy band, electronic state density, charge density and charge density difference, V addition is found to shorten the pseudo-energy gap and enhance interaction force between Mo and W atoms. This tends to improve the mechanical properties of the alloy. The calculated results were in good agreement with the experimental data, demonstrating that the methods were effective in predicting the performance of RHEAs.},

The addition of 0.5-at\% C leads to good formability and remarkable microalloying effects. Nano-NbC precipitates distributed at grain boundaries and dislocations effectively refined the grain size. The yield strength, ultimate compression strength, and ductility were successfully improved up to 1725 MPa, 1782 MPa, and 7.0\%, respectively. Nano-NbC carbide precipitates in the form of diffusion transformation during multiple reheating was verified by thermodynamics, kinetics calculations, and microstructure characterization. C microalloying endowed NbMoTaW RHEA with remarkable enhancements of strength and ductility, which suggested a strategy for designing strong and ductile RHEA through LPBF.},

            This work demonstrates dislocation dynamics in body-centered-cubic (BCC) high-entropy alloys (HEAs). The local composition inhomogeneity in these concentrated solutions leads to an unconventional rate-controlling mechanism that governs dislocation mobility. The activated process becomes nanoscale detrapping, of kinks on screw dislocations and of trapped segments of edge dislocations, presenting an activation barrier of similar magnitude for both dislocation types. Their sluggish mobility explains the elevated strength and strain hardening in BCC HEAs.
          , 
            Atomistic simulations of dislocation mobility reveal that body-centered cubic (BCC) high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are distinctly different from traditional BCC metals. HEAs are concentrated solutions in which composition fluctuation is almost inevitable. The resultant inhomogeneities, while locally promoting kink nucleation on screw dislocations, trap them against propagation with an appreciable energy barrier, replacing kink nucleation as the rate-limiting mechanism. Edge dislocations encounter a similar activated process of nanoscale segment detrapping, with comparable activation barrier. As a result, the mobility of edge dislocations, and hence their contribution to strength, becomes comparable to screw dislocations.},

To unveil the relationships among the morphology, structure and mechanical response, a comprehensive and non-destructive investigation of a model system was sought. In this review, we examined the paradigmatic case of a nanoporous, granular, metallic ultrathin film with comprehensive bottom-up and top-down approaches, both experimentals and theoreticals. The granular film was made of Ag nanoparticles deposited by gas-phase synthesis, thus providing a solvent-free and ultrapure nanoporous system at room temperature. The results, bearing generality beyond the specific model system, are discussed for several applications specific to the morphological and mechanical properties of the investigated films, including bendable electronics, membrane separation and nanofluidic sensing.},

Nanoribbons with a fixed thickness but increased width-to-thickness ratios (9 : 1) were also studied to show that an increase in the surface energy due to the crystal re-orientation suppresses the deformation twinning. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the transition from partial dislocation mediated plasticity to perfect dislocation plasticity with increase in the width-to-thickness ratio is due to the effect of the surface energy.},

	abstract = {The surface energy, particularly for nanoparticles, is one of the most important quantities in understanding the thermodynamics of particles. Therefore, it is astonishing that there is still great uncertainty about its value. The uncertainty increases if one questions its dependence on particle size. Different approaches, such as classical thermodynamics calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and ab initio calculations, exist to predict this quantity. Generally, considerations based on classical thermodynamics lead to the prediction of decreasing values of the surface energy with decreasing particle size. This phenomenon is caused by the reduced number of next neighbors of surface atoms with decreasing particle size, a phenomenon that is partly compensated by the reduction of the binding energy between the atoms with decreasing particle size. Furthermore, this compensating effect may be expected by the formation of a disordered or quasi-liquid layer at the surface. The atomistic approach, based either on molecular dynamics simulations or ab initio calculations, generally leads to values with an opposite tendency. However, it is shown that this result is based on an insufficient definition of the particle size. A more realistic definition of the particle size is possible only by a detailed analysis of the electronic structure obtained from initio calculations. Except for minor variations caused by changes in the structure, only a minor dependence of the surface energy on the particle size is found. The main conclusion of this work is that surface energy values for the equivalent bulk materials should be used if detailed data for nanoparticles are not available.},

            Nanoporous metals are prototypical bicontinuous structures that have a large surface area and many applications. We demonstrate that an in-grain orientation spread develops during coarsening in nanoporous metals, leading to the formation of a nanocrystalline–nanoporous structure. The process of particles detaching and reattaching as the structure coarsens is identified as a mechanism of grain boundary formation. Coarsening the structure results in significant particle detachment with detachment rates that vary drastically with changes in the volume fraction and volume fraction inhomogeneities in the nanostructure. These results demonstrate that particle detachment must be understood to have full control of the nanocrystalline–nanoporous structure and improve material properties.

              Grain boundary formation during coarsening of nanoporous gold (NPG) is investigated wherein a nanocrystalline structure can form by particles detaching and reattaching to the structure. MicroLaue and electron backscatter diffraction measurements demonstrate that an in-grain orientation spread develops as NPG is coarsened. The volume fraction of the NPG sample is near the limit of bicontinuity, at which simulations predict that a bicontinuous structure begins to fragment into independent particles during coarsening. Phase-field simulations of coarsening using a computationally generated structure with a volume fraction near the limit of bicontinuity are used to model particle detachment rates. This model is tested by using the measured NPG structure as an initial condition in the phase-field simulations. We predict that up to

              sample is annealed at 300 °C for 420 min. The quantity of volume detached is found to be highly dependent on the volume fraction and volume fraction homogeneity of the nanostructure. As the void phase in the experiments cannot support independent particles, they must fall and reattach to the structure, a process that results in the formation of new grain boundaries. This particle reattachment process, along with other classic processes, leads to the formation of grain boundaries during coarsening in nanoporous metals. The formation of grain boundaries can impact a variety of applications, including mechanical strengthening; thus, the consideration and understanding of particle detachment phenomena are essential when studying nanoporous metals.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We revisit the meaning of stacking fault energy (SFE) and the assumptions of equilibrium dissociation of lattice dislocations in concentrated alloys. SFE is a unique value in pure metals. However, in alloys beyond the dilute limit, SFE has a distribution of values depending on the local atomic environment. Conventionally, the equilibrium distance between partial dislocations is determined by a balance between the repulsive elastic interaction between the partial dislocations and a unique value for SFE. This assumption is used to determine SFE from experimental measurements of dislocation splitting distances in metals and alloys, often contradicting computational predictions. We use atomistic simulations in a model NiCo alloy to study the dislocation dissociation process in a range of compositions with positive, zero, and negative average SFE and surprisingly observe a stable, finite splitting distance in all cases at low temperatures. We then compute the decorrelation stress and examine the balance of forces on the partial dislocations, considering the local effects on SFE, and observe that even the upper bound of SFE distribution alone cannot satisfy the force balance in some cases. Furthermore, we show that in concentrated solid solutions, the resisting force caused by interaction of dislocations with the local solute environment becomes a major force acting on partial dislocations. Here, we show that the presence of a high solute/dislocation interaction, which is not easy to measure and neglected in experimental measurements of SFE, renders the experimental values of SFE unreliable.},

	abstract = {Plastic deformation in crystalline materials occurs through dislocation slip and strengthening is achieved with obstacles that hinder the motion of dislocations. At relatively low temperatures, dislocations bypass the particles by Orowan looping, particle shearing, cross-slip or a combination of these mechanisms. At elevated temperatures, atomic diffusivity becomes appreciable, so that dislocations can bypass the particles by climb processes. Climb plays a crucial role in the long-term durability or creep resistance of many structural materials, particularly under extreme conditions of load, temperature and radiation. Here we systematically examine dislocation-particle interaction mechanisms. The analysis is based on three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations incorporating impenetrable particles, elastic interactions, dislocation self-climb, cross-slip and glide. The core diffusion dominated dislocation self-climb process is modelled based on a variational principle for the evolution of microstructures, and is coupled with dislocation glide and cross-slip by an adaptive time-stepping scheme to bridge the time scale separation. The stress field caused by particles is implemented based on the particle–matrix mismatch. This model is helpful for understanding the fundamental particle bypass mechanisms and clarifying the effects of dislocation glide, climb and cross-slip on creep deformation.},

              CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) was synthesized successfully from elemental powders by mechanical alloying (MA) and subsequent consolidation by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The alloying behavior, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the HEA were assessed using X-ray diffraction, electron microscope, hardness, and compression tests. MA of the elemental powders for 8 h has resulted in a two-phased microstructure:
              α-fcc
              and
              β-bcc
              phases. On the other hand, the consolidated bulk Al

In this work, the molecular dynamics method is used to calculate the tensile properties of face-centered cubic Al0.1CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys containing Σ3 grain boundaries and without grain boundary. The atomic model was established by the melting rapid cooling method, then stretched by the static drawing method. The common neighbor analysis and dislocation extraction algorithm are used to analyze the crystal evolution mechanism of Σ3 grain boundaries to improve the material properties of high-entropy alloys during the tensile test. The results show that compared with the mechanical properties Al0.1CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys without grain boundary, the yield strength and Young’s modulus of a high-entropy alloy containing Σ3 grain boundary are obviously larger than that of high-entropy alloys without grain boundary.

          , 
            
              High entropy alloys (HEAs), composed of multiple components with equal or near atomic proportions, have extraordinary mechanical properties and are expected to bear the impact of high-speed forces in armor protection structure materials. In order to understand the deformation behaviour of HEAs under tensile and compressive loading, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to reveal the deformation mechanism and mechanical properties of three crystal structures: Al
              0.1
              CoCrFeNi HEAs without grain boundaries (perfect HEAs), Al
              0.1
              CoCrFeNi HEAs with grain boundaries of Σ3(111)[11̄0] (GBs HEAs) and grain boundaries of Σ3(111)[11̄0] with chemical cluster HEAs (cluster-GBs HEAs). The mechanical properties of the three models at the same strain rate were discussed. Then, the mechanical properties at different strain rates were analyzed. The movement and direction of internal dislocations during the deformation process were investigated. The simulation results show that the GBs HEAs and the cluster-GBs both play an important role in the deformation and failure of the HEAs. Under tensile loading, three behaviour stages of deformation were observed. Cluster-GBs HEAs have a larger yield strength and Young's modulus than that of GBs and perfect HEAs. The higher the strain rate is, the greater the stress reduction rate. Under compressive loading, there are only two behaviour stages of deformation. Cluster-GBs HEAs also have the largest yield strength. Under tensile and compressive deformation, Shockley partial dislocations of 1/6 {\textless}112{\textgreater} are dominant and their moving direction and effect on mechanical properties are discussed.},

            Molecular dynamics is applied to explore the deformation mechanism and crystal structure development of the AlCoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys under nanoimprinting. The influences of crystal structure, alloy composition, grain size, and twin boundary distance on the mechanical properties are carefully analyzed. The imprinting load indicates that the highest loading force is in ascending order with polycrystalline, nano-twinned (NT) polycrystalline, and monocrystalline. The change in alloy composition suggests that the imprinting force increases as the Al content in the alloy increases. The reverse Hall–Petch relation found for the polycrystalline structure, while the Hall–Petch and reverse Hall–Petch relations are discovered in the NT-polycrystalline, which is due to the interactions between the dislocations and grain/twin boundaries (GBs/TBs). The deformation behavior shows that shear strain and local stress are concentrated not only around the punch but also on GBs and adjacent to GBs. The slide and twist of the GBs play a major in controlling the deformation mechanism of polycrystalline structure. The twin boundary migrations are detected during the nanoimprinting of the NT-polycrystalline. Furthermore, the elastic recovery of material is insensitive to changes in alloy composition and grain size, and the formability of the pattern is higher with a decrease in TB distance.},

          , 
            A body-centered cubic W-based refractory high entropy alloy with outstanding radiation resistance has been developed. The alloy was grown as thin films showing a bimodal grain size distribution in the nanocrystalline and ultrafine regimes and a unique 4-nm lamella-like structure revealed by atom probe tomography (APT). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray diffraction show certain black spots appearing after thermal annealing at elevated temperatures. TEM and APT analysis correlated the black spots with second-phase particles rich in Cr and V. No sign of irradiation-created dislocation loops, even after 8 dpa, was observed. Furthermore, nanomechanical testing shows a large hardness of 14 GPa in the as-deposited samples, with near negligible irradiation hardening. Theoretical modeling combining ab initio and Monte Carlo techniques predicts the formation of Cr- and V-rich second-phase particles and points at equal mobilities of point defects as the origin of the exceptional radiation tolerance.},

          , 
            Accompanied by enhancements in the ability to fabricate materials for humans, alloy-based materials have advanced from binary alloy systems to complicated compositions along with affording newer applications, which can accelerate the evolution of civilization. Recently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have drawn enormous attention in diverse fields because of their distinctive concept and unique properties. The impressive mechanical properties, such as excellent strength, unforgettable corrosion resistance, and superior thermostability, are inherited and overwhelming compared with traditional alloys. Therefore, HEAs have become an emerging class of advanced materials leading to a new field. Based on the exceptional synthesis methods, HEAs surprisingly afford numerous energy and environmental properties, which have endowed HEAs with promising applications. In this paper, we review the salient features of HEAs and summarize their core effects, phase structures, unconventional synthesis methods, and novel energy and environmental applications. In addition, we also discuss the broad space waiting to be explored and overview fruitful pathways of future trends and prospects.},

The slow component of the 518 nm absorbance change correlates with the light-induced change in 90 degrees light scattering at 518 nm. Both show a similar time course, similar pH dependence with a maximum at pH 6.0, and similar sensitivity to inhibitors and to treatment of the chloroplasts with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde. Their light minus dark difference spectra are similar with maxima at about 520 nm. It is concluded that they are manifestations of the same phenomenon, and the slow absorbance increase at 518 nm is due to enhanced scattering. It is proposed that the light-induced changes in scattering at 518 nm reflect alterations in selective dispersion, due to proton uptake and conformational changes in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane.},

	abstract = {High-entropy alloys are a new type of material developed in recent years. It breaks the traditional alloy-design conventions and has many excellent properties. High-pressure treatment is an effective means to change the structures and properties of metal materials. The pressure can effectively vary the distance and interaction between molecules or atoms, so as to change the bonding mode, and form high-pressure phases. These new material states often have different structures and characteristics, compared to untreated metal materials. At present, high-pressure technology is an effective method to prepare alloys with unique properties, and there are many techniques that can achieve high pressures. The most commonly used methods include high-pressure torsion, large cavity presses and diamond-anvil-cell presses. The materials show many unique properties under high pressures which do not exist under normal conditions, providing a new approach for the in-depth study of materials. In this paper, high-pressure (HP) technologies applied to high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are reviewed, and some possible ways to develop good properties of HEAs using HP as fabrication are introduced. Moreover, the studies of HEAs under high pressures are summarized, in order to deepen the basic understanding of HEAs under high pressures, which provides the theoretical basis for the application of high-entropy alloys.},

	abstract = {Conventional first-principle approaches for studying nonequilibrium processes depend on the mechanics of individual particles or quantum states and as a result require many details of the mechanical features of the system to arrive at a macroscopic property. In contrast, thermodynamics, which has been successful in the stable equilibrium realm, provides an approach for determining macroscopic properties without the mechanical details. Nonetheless, this phenomenological approach is not generally applicable to a nonequilibrium process except in the near-equilibrium realm and under the local equilibrium and continuum assumptions, both of which limit its ability to describe nonequilibrium phenomena. Furthermore, predicting the thermodynamic features of a nonequilibrium process (of entropy generation) across all scales is difficult. To address these drawbacks, steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT) can be used. It provides a first-principle thermodynamic-ensemble based approach applicable to the entire nonequilibrium realm even that far-from-equilibrium and does so with a single kinematics and dynamics, which crosses all temporal and spatial scales. Based on prior developments by the authors, SEAQT is used here to study the heat and mass diffusion of indistinguishable particles. The study focuses on the thermodynamic features of far-from-equilibrium state evolution, which is separated from the specific mechanics of individual particle interactions. Results for nonequilibrium size (volume) and concentration effects on the evolutionary state trajectory are presented for the case of high temperature and low particle concentration, which, however, do not impact the generality of the theory and will in future studies be relaxed.},

These phenomena occur at multiple temporal and spatial scales, making the modeling, especially in the transient regime, very difficult. Nonetheless, multiscale models are needed to improve the understanding of oxygen reduction and guide cathode design. Of particular importance for long-term operation are microstructure degradation and chromium oxide poisoning both of which degrade cathode performance. Existing methods are phenomenological or empirical in nature and their application limited to the continuum realm with quantum effects not captured. In contrast, steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics can be used to model nonequilibrium processes (even those far-from equilibrium) at all scales. The nonequilibrium relaxation is characterized by entropy generation, which can unify coupled phenomena into one framework to model transient and steady behavior. The results reveal the effects on performance of the different timescales of the varied phenomena involved and their coupling. Results are included here for the effects of chromium oxide concentrations on cathode output as is a parametric study of the effects of interconnect-three-phase-boundary length, oxygen mean free path, and adsorption site effectiveness. A qualitative comparison with experimental results is made.},

	abstract = {Suppression of carbon contamination in GaN films grown using metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) is a crucial issue in its application to high power and high frequency electronic devices. To know how to reduce the C concentration in the films, a sequential analysis based on first principles calculations is performed. Thus, surface reconstruction and the adsorption of the CH4 produced by the decomposition of the Ga source, Ga(CH3)3, and its incorporation into the GaN sub-surface layers are investigated. In this sequential analysis, the dataset of the adsorption probability of CH4 on reconstructed surfaces is indispensable, as is the energy of the C impurity in the GaN sub-surface layers. The C adsorption probability is obtained based on steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT). SEAQT is a thermodynamic ensemble-based, non-phenomenological framework that can predict the behavior of non-equilibrium processes, even those far from equilibrium. This framework is suitable especially when one studies the adsorption behavior of an impurity molecule because the conventional approach, the chemical potential control method, cannot be applied to a quantitative analysis for such a system. The proposed sequential model successfully explains the influence of the growth orientation, GaN(0001) and (000−1), on the incorporation of C into the film. This model can contribute to the suppression of the C contamination in GaN MOVPE.},

              The steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic (SEAQT) framework was used to calculate the stability of a collection of point defects in 2D PtSe
              2
              and predict the kinetics with which defects rearrange during thermal annealing. The framework provides a non-equilibrium, ensemble-based framework with a self-consistent link between mechanics (both quantum and classical) and thermodynamics. It employs an equation of motion derived from the principle of steepest entropy ascent (maximum entropy production) to predict the time evolution of a set of occupation probabilities that define the states of a system undergoing a non-equilibrium process. The system is described by a degenerate energy landscape of eigenvalues, and the entropy is found from the occupation probabilities and the eigenlevel degeneracies. Scanning tunneling microscopy was used to identify the structure and distribution of point defects observed experimentally in a 2D PtSe
              2
              film. A catalog of observed defects includes six unique point defects (vacancies and anti-site defects on Pt and Se sublattices) and twenty combinations of multiple point defects in close proximity. The defect energies were estimated with density functional theory, while the degeneracies, or density of states, for the 2D film with all possible combinations or arrangements of cataloged defects was constructed using a non-Markovian Monte-Carlo approach (i.e. the Replica–Exchange–Wang–Landau algorithm (Vogel

The framework predicts how a chain moves from an initial non-equilibrium state to stable equilibrium along a unique thermodynamic path. The thermodynamic state is expressed by occupation probabilities corresponding to the levels of a discrete energy landscape. The landscape is generated using the Replica Exchange Wang–Landau method applied to a polymer chain represented by a sequence of hydrophobic and polar monomers with a simple hydrophobic-polar amino acid model. The chain conformation evolves as energy shifts among the levels of the energy landscape according to the principle of steepest entropy ascent. This principle is implemented via the SEAQT equation of motion. The SEAQT framework has the benefit of providing insight into structural properties under non-equilibrium conditions. Chain conformations during heating and cooling change continuously without sharp transitions in morphology. The changes are more drastic along non-equilibrium paths than along quasi-equilibrium paths. The SEAQT-predicted kinetics are fitted to rates associated with the experimental intensity profiles of cytochrome c protein folding with Rouse dynamics.},

	abstract = {The role of phonon dispersion in the prediction of the thermal conductivity of germanium between temperatures of 2 K and 1000 K is investigated using the Holland approach. If no dispersion is assumed, a large, nonphysical discontinuity is found in the transverse phonon relaxation time over the entire temperature range. However, this effect is masked in the final prediction of the thermal conductivity by the use of fitting parameters. As the treatment of the dispersion is refined, the magnitude of the discontinuity is reduced. At the same time, discrepancies between the high temperature predictions and experimental data become apparent, indicating that the assumed heat transfer mechanisms (i.e., the relaxation time models) are not sufficient to account for the expected thermal transport. Molecular dynamics simulations may be the most suitable tool available for addressing this issue.},

	abstract = {The Bi2Te3, Bi1.9Lu0.1Te3 and Bi1.9Tm0.1Te3 thermoelectrics of n-type conductivity have been prepared by the microwave-solvothermal method and spark plasma sintering. These compounds behave as degenerate semiconductors from room temperature up to temperature Td ≈ 470 K. Within this temperature range the temperature behavior of the specific electrical resistivity is due to the temperature changes of electron mobility determined by acoustic and optical phonon scattering. Above Td, an onset of intrinsic conductivity takes place when electrons and holes are present. At the Lu and Tm doping, the Seebeck coefficient increases, while the specific electrical resistivity and total thermal conductivity decrease within the temperature 290–630 K range. The increase of the electrical resistivity is related to the increase of electron concentration since the Tm and Lu atoms are donor centres in the Bi2Te3 lattice. The increase of the density-of-state effective mass for conduction band can be responsible for the increase of the Seebeck coefficient. The decrease of the total thermal conductivity in doped Bi2Te3 is attributed to point defects like the antisite defects and Lu or Tm atoms substituting for the Bi sites. In addition, reducing the electron thermal conductivity due to forming a narrow impurity (Lu or Tm) band having high and sharp density-of-states near the Fermi level can effectively decrease the total thermal conductivity. The thermoelectric figure-of-merit is enhanced from ∼ 0.4 for undoped Bi2Te3 up to ∼ 0.7 for Bi1.9Tm0.1Te3 and ∼ 0.9 for Bi1.9Lu0.1Te3.},

In this study, a Te crystal-embedded Bi2Te3 (Te–Bi2Te3) thin film was formed by establishing a specific annealing temperature for a Te-rich Bi/Te multilayered structure. Modulations in structure and composition were observed at the boundaries between the two phases of Te and Bi2Te3. Furthermore, the samples contained regularly shaped nanometer-scale Bi2Te3 single grains. Therefore, we obtained a dramatic ZT value of 2.27 (+ 0.04, − 0.08) at 375 K from the Te–Bi2Te3 thin film. Finally, we confirmed that interface phonon scattering between the Te–Bi2Te3 boundaries plays an important role in inter-grain phonon transport, which results in a reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity.},

	abstract = {In this paper, Bi2Te3 nanosheets were firstly synthesized by solvothermal method, and then Ti3C2Tx (indicating O, F, OH, etc.) was introduced into bismuth telluride nanosheets with good thermoelectric properties as the second phase by the composite method of “ultrasonic dispersion-flash freeze-drying” combined with discharge plasma sintering technique, and the Bi2Te3/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites were successfully prepared. The effects of different contents of Ti3C2 T x on the thermoelectric properties of Bi2 Te3/Ti3C2 T x nanocomposites were also investigated. The samples were characterized and performance tested using scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, thermoelectric test system, and laser thermal conductivity meter. The results show that the introduction of titanium carbide into the bismuth telluride nanomatrix increases the carrier concentration of bismuth telluride, leading to an increase in conductivity and a decrease in Seebeck coefficient, but the energy barrier scattering at the composite interface avoids a significant decrease in Seebeck coefficient; the nanocrystalline boundary between titanium carbide and bismuth telluride increases phonon scattering and interfacial thermal resistance and decreases thermal conductivity. The 1 vol\% bismuth Bi2Te3/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites showed a 25\% increase in thermoelectric figure of merit compared to the bismuth Bi2Te3 nanomatrix. 1 vol\% Bi3Te3/Ti3C2T x nanocomposites had the highest ZT value of 0.908 at 432 K and the average ZT value of 0.87 in the range of376-511 K.},

            Refractory multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have exceptional mechanical properties, including high strength-to-weight ratio and fracture toughness, at high temperatures. Here we elucidate the complex interplay between segregation, short-range order, and strengthening in the NbMoTaW MPEA through atomistic simulations with a highly accurate machine learning interatomic potential. In the single crystal MPEA, we find greatly reduced anisotropy in the critically resolved shear stress between screw and edge dislocations compared to the elemental metals. In the polycrystalline MPEA, we demonstrate that thermodynamically driven Nb segregation to the grain boundaries (GBs) and W enrichment within the grains intensifies the observed short-range order (SRO). The increased GB stability due to Nb enrichment reduces the von Mises strain, resulting in higher strength than a random solid solution MPEA. These results highlight the need to simultaneously tune GB composition and bulk SRO to tailor the mechanical properties of MPEAs.},

on the gas kinetic theory to the recent ones using the Monte Carlo methods or the radiative multifux models, each technique
involves the dispersion properties of the crystal lattice. Besides, most of these studies have been done in the frame of the
relaxation time approximation of collision processes. In this study, the importance of the choice of the dispersion curves
and time relaxation parameters are pointed out. A complete description of the transverse umklapp interaction is provided without
any adjustment parameters. New insights of the energy conservation surface calculation, involved in phonon-phonon time relaxation
expression, are provided. Using simple and more complex models, we have determined the heat transport properties, in the temperature
range from 50K to 1000K in bulk silicon. We especially focused our attention on the thermal conductivity as a function of
the phonon anharmonic resistive mechanisms for two models of dispersion: “linear” and “quadratic”. We demonstrate that very
different thermal conductivity properties can be calculated according to the chosen description of lattice vibrations.},

We find that accurate representation of the phonon-phonon scattering strength and inclusion of scattering of acoustic phonons by optic phonons are essential ingredients, which are missing from the decades old derivations of commonly used intrinsic relaxation times.

	abstract = {A material strength depends on its microstructure, which in turn, is controlled by an engineering process. Strengthening mechanisms like work hardening, precipitate, and grain boundary strengthening can alter the strength of a material in a predictive, quantitative manner and are readily linked to the deformation mechanism. This quantification strongly depends on the characteristic length scale of a particular microstructure, thereby dictating bulk material’s strength as a function of, for example, grain or precipitate size, twin boundary spacing, or dislocation density. This microstructural, or intrinsic, size governs the mechanical properties and post-elastic material deformation at all sample dimensions, as the classical definition of “ultimate tensile strength” deems it to be “an intensive property, therefore its value does not depend on the size of the test specimen.” Yet in the last 5years, the vast majority of uniaxial deformation experiments and computations on small-scale metallic structures unambiguously demonstrated that at the micron and sub-micron scales, this definition no longer holds true. In fact, it has been shown that in single crystals the ultimate tensile strength and the yield strength scale with external sample size in a power law fashion, sometimes attaining a significant fraction of material’s theoretical strength, and exhibiting the now-commonly-known phenomenon “smaller is stronger.” Understanding of this “extrinsic size effect” at small scales is not yet mature and is currently a topic of rigorous investigations. As both the intrinsic (i.e. microstructural) and extrinsic (i.e. sample size) dimensions play a non-trivial role in the mechanical properties and material deformation mechanisms, it is critical to develop an understanding of their interplay and mutual effects on the mechanical properties and material deformation, especially in small-scale structures. This review focuses on providing an overview of metal-based material classes whose properties as a function of external size have been investigated and provides a critical discussion on the combined effects of intrinsic and extrinsic sizes on the material deformation behavior.},

By studying the deformation characteristics of three FCC materials with disparate stacking fault energies (gold, copper and nickel), we ﬁnd that the deformation mechanisms in the nanowires are a function of the intrinsic material properties, applied stress state, axial crystallographic orientation and exposed transverse surfaces. The key ﬁnding of this work is the ﬁrst order effect that side surface orientation has on the operant mode of inelastic deformation in both h1 0 0i and h1 1 0i nanowires. Comparisons to expected deformation modes, as calculated using crystallographic Schmid factors for tension and compression, are provided to illustrate how transverse surface orientations can directly alter the deformation mechanisms in materials with nanometer scale dimensions.},

With the aim of enhancing the hardness of aluminium nitride (19 GPa), the present study on the proposed combinations reveal that B0.75Al0.25N (40.5 GPa) and B0.875Al0.125N (49.5 GPa) alloys turn out to be superhard materials as their hardness surpasses 40 GPa. Further, B0.875Al0.125N alloy has been identified to serve as a good thermoelectric as it has a high Seebeck coefficient value of 240 µV/K and of melting temperature of 4282 K. Except for the binary compounds AlN and BN, all the other ternary alloys are predicted to be direct band gap materials. The density of states, band structure, charge density plot, various elastic moduli, Debye’s temperature, elastic wave velocity, dielectric constant, Seebeck’s coefficient and other properties of interest are discussed in this paper.

	abstract = {Over the last decade, progress in wide bandgap, III-V materials systems based on gallium nitride (GaN) has been a major driver in the realization of high power and high frequency electronic devices. Since the highly conductive, two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the AlGaN/GaN interface is based on built-in polarization fields (not doping) and is confined to very small thicknesses, its charge carriers exhibit much higher mobilities in comparison to their doped counterparts. In this study, we show that this heterostructured material also offers the unique ability to manipulate electrical transport separately from thermal transport through the examination of fully-suspended AlGaN/GaN diaphragms of varied GaN buffer layer thicknesses. Notably, we show that {\textasciitilde}100 nm thin GaN layers can considerably impede heat flow ({\textasciitilde}5x lower thermal conductivity in comparison with bulk GaN) without electrical transport degradation, and that a significant improvement ({\textasciitilde}4x) in the thermoelectric figure of merit over externally doped GaN is observed in 2DEG based heterostructures. This remarkable tuning behavior and thermoelectric enhancement, elucidated here for the first time in a polarization-based heterostructure, is achieved since the electrons are at the heterostructured interface, while the phonons are within the material system.},

	abstract = {Small modular reactors (SMRs; i.e., nuclear reactors that produce {\textless}300 MWelec each) have garnered attention because of claims of inherent safety features and reduced cost. However, remarkably few studies have analyzed the management and disposal of their nuclear waste streams. Here, we compare three distinct SMR designs to an 1,100-MWelec pressurized water reactor in terms of the energy-equivalent volume, (radio-)chemistry, decay heat, and fissile isotope composition of (notional) high-, intermediate-, and low-level waste streams. Results reveal that water-, molten salt–, and sodium-cooled SMR designs will increase the volume of nuclear waste in need of management and disposal by factors of 2 to 30. The excess waste volume is attributed to the use of neutron reflectors and/or of chemically reactive fuels and coolants in SMR designs. That said, volume is not the most important evaluation metric; rather, geologic repository performance is driven by the decay heat power and the (radio-)chemistry of spent nuclear fuel, for which SMRs provide no benefit. SMRs will not reduce the generation of geochemically mobile 129I, 99Tc, and 79Se fission products, which are important dose contributors for most repository designs. In addition, SMR spent fuel will contain relatively high concentrations of fissile nuclides, which will demand novel approaches to evaluating criticality during storage and disposal. Since waste stream properties are influenced by neutron leakage, a basic physical process that is enhanced in small reactor cores, SMRs will exacerbate the challenges of nuclear waste management and disposal.},

	abstract = {We report findings from several ab-initio, self-consistent calculations of electronic and transport properties of wurtzite aluminum nitride (w-AlN). Our calculations utilized a local density approximation (LDA) potential and the linear combination of Gaussian orbitals (LCGO). Unlike some other density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we employed the Bagayoko, Zhao, and Williams' method, enhanced by Ekuma and Franklin (BZW-EF). The BZW-EF method verifiably leads to the minima of the occupied energies; these minima, the low laying unoccupied energies, and related wave functions provide the most variationally and physically valid density functional theory (DFT) description of the ground states of materials under study. With multiple oxidation states of Al (Al3+ to Al) and the availability of N3− to N, the BZW-EF method required several sets of self-consistent calculations with different ionic species as input. The binding energy for (Al3+\& N3−) as input was 1.5 eV larger in magnitude than those for other input choices; the results discussed here are those from the calculation that led to the absolute minima of the occupied energies with this input. Our calculated, direct band gap for w-AlN, at the Γ point, is 6.28 eV, in excellent agreement with the 6.28 eV experimental value at 5K. We discuss the bands, total and partial densities of states, and calculated, effective masses.},

At lowest temperatures, κ(T) approaches the conductivity limited by the diffuse phonon scattering from sample surfaces. The peculiarities in measured κ(T) suggest that the phonon scattering from point defects contributes essentially to the total phonon scattering in samples under investigation at low temperatures. The phonon interaction with electrons and holes bound to neutral donor and acceptor centers is suggested, adding substantially to thermal resistivity near and below the peak in κ(T).},

	abstract = {Dislocations in high entropy alloys (HEAs) are wavy and have natural pinning points due to the variable chemical and energetic landscape surrounding the dislocation core. This can influence the critical shear stress necessary to initiate dislocation motion and the details associated with sustained dislocation glide. The objective of this work is to determine the relationship between Schmid shear stress and dislocation velocity in single phase FCC FeNiCrCoCu HEAs using molecular dynamics simulations, with comparisons made to dislocation motion in homogeneous Ni and Cu. Simulations are performed for four different dislocation character angles: 0° (screw), 30°, 60° and 90° (edge). Several key differences are reported, compared to what is previously known about dislocation motion in homogeneous FCC metals. For example, the drag coefficient B in the phonon damping regime for HEAs has a nonlinear dependence on temperature, whereas this dependence is linear in Ni. Mobility relationships between different types of dislocations common in homogeneous FCC metals, such as the velocity of screw and 60° dislocations being lower than edge and 30° dislocations at the same shear stress, do not necessarily hold in HEAs. Dislocation waviness is measured and is found to correlate with the ability of dislocations to glide under an applied shear stress, including the temperature dependence of the drag coefficient B. These results confirm that the influence of HEA chemical complexity on dislocation motion is important and this data can be used to guide development of analytical or empirical models for dislocation mobility in HEAs.},

	abstract = {A material strength depends on its microstructure, which in turn, is controlled by an engineering process. Strengthening mechanisms like work hardening, precipitate, and grain boundary strengthening can alter the strength of a material in a predictive, quantitative manner and are readily linked to the deformation mechanism. This quantification strongly depends on the characteristic length scale of a particular microstructure, thereby dictating bulk material’s strength as a function of, for example, grain or precipitate size, twin boundary spacing, or dislocation density. This microstructural, or intrinsic, size governs the mechanical properties and post-elastic material deformation at all sample dimensions, as the classical definition of “ultimate tensile strength” deems it to be “an intensive property, therefore its value does not depend on the size of the test specimen.” Yet in the last 5years, the vast majority of uniaxial deformation experiments and computations on small-scale metallic structures unambiguously demonstrated that at the micron and sub-micron scales, this definition no longer holds true. In fact, it has been shown that in single crystals the ultimate tensile strength and the yield strength scale with external sample size in a power law fashion, sometimes attaining a significant fraction of material’s theoretical strength, and exhibiting the now-commonly-known phenomenon “smaller is stronger.” Understanding of this “extrinsic size effect” at small scales is not yet mature and is currently a topic of rigorous investigations. As both the intrinsic (i.e. microstructural) and extrinsic (i.e. sample size) dimensions play a non-trivial role in the mechanical properties and material deformation mechanisms, it is critical to develop an understanding of their interplay and mutual effects on the mechanical properties and material deformation, especially in small-scale structures. This review focuses on providing an overview of metal-based material classes whose properties as a function of external size have been investigated and provides a critical discussion on the combined effects of intrinsic and extrinsic sizes on the material deformation behavior.},

This review focused on the characterization and understanding of the mechanical properties of nanowires, including elasticity, plasticity, anelasticity and strength. As the results from the previous literature in this area appear inconsistent, a critical evaluation of the characterization techniques and methodologies were presented.

We investigated the inhomogeneous microtexture evolution of gold wire that was cold drawn through an asymmetric diamond die. In this study, the distributions of the {\textless}111{\textgreater} and {\textless}100{\textgreater} textures in a 20 μm diameter fine gold wire are the variables and their effects on the bonding stability of the wire were estimated by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and finite element method (FEM) simulations. The use of a focused ion beam apparatus enabled a high quality of band contrast of the EBSD to be achieved in the exact half cross-sectional area of the fine gold wire. The detailed three-dimensional FEM results show that the asymmetric distribution of the textures plays a crucial role in increasing the spatial displacement of the gold bonding wire.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the smallness, modularity and reactor-design aspects of emerging small modular reactors (SMRs). It is shown that small (whether in physical size or power level) reactors are not new, but offer economic and flexibility advantages that allow their use in a variety of applications. The different definitions of modularity are reviewed, including modularity in design, process intensification, manufacturing and construction. It is shown that these forms of modularity when applied to SMRs have some advantages, but also have some challenges that need to be addressed if their full potential is to be realized. Even if these forms of modularity are not fully utilized, the lower power (≤300 MW electrical) of SMRs allows the formation of larger power plants by incremental addition of reactor units, in the so-called scale modularity. The paper reviews the unique features of emerging SMR designs, and compares them to those of the early era of nuclear power. It is shown that while many modern SMR designs incorporate well-proven features that were tested and proven in early reactors. others introduce aspects of Generation IV reactors, in terms of inherent and/or passive safety. Given the promise of SMRs as means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their ability to supply reliable and base-load power, the licensing of such reactors by national regulators will provide a boost to their acceptability and adaptability as a player in combating climate change.},

With the growing enhancement in thermoelectric performance, it is also companied with the complexation of defects induced in the materials. 0D point defects, 1D linear defects, 2D planar defects, and 3D bulk defects have all been induced in thermoelectric materials for the optimization of thermoelectric performance. Considering the distinct characteristics of each type of defects, in-depth understanding of their roles in the thermoelectric transport process is of vital importance. In this paper, we classify and summarize the defect-related physical effects on both band structure and transport behavior of carriers and phonons when inducing different types of defects. Recent achievements in experimental characterization and theoretical simulation of defects are also summarized for accurately determining the type of defects serving for the design of thermoelectric materials. Finally, based on the current theoretical and experimental achievements, strategies engaged with multiple dimensional defects are reviewed for thermoelectric performance optimization.},

	abstract = {A first-principle plane-wave pseudopotential method based on the density function theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the effects of vacancy cluster (VC) defects on the band structure and thermoelectric properties of silicon (Si) crystals. Simulation results showed that various VC defects changed the energy band and localized electron density distribution of Si crystals and caused the band gap to decrease with increasing VC size. The results can be ascribed to the formation of a defect level produced by the dangling bonds, floating bonds, or high-strain atoms surrounding the VC defects. The appearance of imaginary frequencies in the phonon spectrum of defective Si crystals indicates that the defect-region structure is dynamically unstable and demonstrates phase changes. The phonon dispersion relation and phonon density of state were also investigated using density functional perturbation theory.

	abstract = {Silicon Germanium thin films are the most stable thermoelectric materials at high temperatures. Nonetheless, low efficiency and limited knowledge of such structures are still a challenge to research. Understanding the various mechanisms taking place in the matter and their relationships is the next step to boost research and to enhance the TE efficiencies, widening the range of applications. In this thesis, we develop a mathematical approach based on solid state theory to calculate the figure of merit from an electronic band structure. Added to DFT, this near ab initio method rapidly assesses virtual structures as possible TE materials. In this report, the method is applied to bulk silicon germanium with good agreement with experimental results. Throughout the development of this method, we also conclude that TE semiconductors band-gaps are related to the range of temperature where the material show higher values of ZT. We also show that doping with donors and acceptors, which is a common enhancement, need optimization for high temperatures applications due to its contribution to the thermal conductivity. Moreover the carriers' mobility is a prevalent parameter but its calculation remains complex. So, we implement deformation potential theory with DFT to calculate the electron-phonon interactions in silicon germanium alloys. We find no change of interactions with the alloy composition. With enough computing power, these methods are applicable to low dimensions structures. In addition to our theoretical study, we report a sputter deposition method of silicon germanium alloy thin films with controlled composition and thickness, grown on a sputtered layer of silicon dioxide. XRD study shows the appearance of a crystal phase beginning at deposition temperatures of 650 C . Reflectivity and TEM provide a consistent measurement of deposition thickness in the range of 20 to 100 nm with average interfaces roughness around 2 nm.},

	abstract = {We give a review of the theoretical approaches for predicting spectral phonon mean free path and thermal conductivity of solids. The methods can be summarized into two categories: anharmonic lattice dynamics calculation and molecular dynamics simulation. In the anharmonic lattice dynamics calculation, the anharmonic force constants are used first to calculate the phonon scattering rates, and then the Boltzmann transport equations are solved using either standard single mode relaxation time approximation or the Iterative Scheme method for the thermal conductivity. The MD method involves the time domain or frequency domain normal mode analysis. We present the theoretical frameworks of the methods for the prediction of phonon dispersion, spectral phonon relaxation time, and thermal conductivity of pure bulk materials, layer and tube structures, nanowires, defective materials, and superlattices. Several examples of their applications in thermal management and thermoelectric materials are given. The strength and limitations of these methods are compared in several different aspects. For more efficient and accurate predictions, the improvements of those methods are still needed.},

	abstract = {Significance
            This work demonstrates dislocation dynamics in body-centered-cubic (BCC) high-entropy alloys (HEAs). The local composition inhomogeneity in these concentrated solutions leads to an unconventional rate-controlling mechanism that governs dislocation mobility. The activated process becomes nanoscale detrapping, of kinks on screw dislocations and of trapped segments of edge dislocations, presenting an activation barrier of similar magnitude for both dislocation types. Their sluggish mobility explains the elevated strength and strain hardening in BCC HEAs.
          , 
            Atomistic simulations of dislocation mobility reveal that body-centered cubic (BCC) high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are distinctly different from traditional BCC metals. HEAs are concentrated solutions in which composition fluctuation is almost inevitable. The resultant inhomogeneities, while locally promoting kink nucleation on screw dislocations, trap them against propagation with an appreciable energy barrier, replacing kink nucleation as the rate-limiting mechanism. Edge dislocations encounter a similar activated process of nanoscale segment detrapping, with comparable activation barrier. As a result, the mobility of edge dislocations, and hence their contribution to strength, becomes comparable to screw dislocations.},

The film porosity and morphology strongly affect nanoporous films mechanical properties, the knowledge of which is fundamental for designing films for specific applications. To unveil the relationships among the morphology, structure and mechanical response, a comprehensive and non-destructive investigation of a model system was sought. In this review, we examined the paradigmatic case of a nanoporous, granular, metallic ultrathin film with comprehensive bottom-up and top-down approaches, both experimentals and theoreticals. The granular film was made of Ag nanoparticles deposited by gas-phase synthesis, thus providing a solvent-free and ultrapure nanoporous system at room temperature. The results, bearing generality beyond the specific model system, are discussed for several applications specific to the morphological and mechanical properties of the investigated films, including bendable electronics, membrane separation and nanofluidic sensing.},

The critical dimension below which the ordinary plasticity transits to deformation twinning is experimentally determined to be ∼170 nm for Au nanowires with equilateral cross-sections. Nanoribbons with a fixed thickness but increased width-to-thickness ratios (9 : 1) were also studied to show that an increase in the surface energy due to the crystal re-orientation suppresses the deformation twinning. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the transition from partial dislocation mediated plasticity to perfect dislocation plasticity with increase in the width-to-thickness ratio is due to the effect of the surface energy.},

            Nanoporous metals are prototypical bicontinuous structures that have a large surface area and many applications. We demonstrate that an in-grain orientation spread develops during coarsening in nanoporous metals, leading to the formation of a nanocrystalline–nanoporous structure. The process of particles detaching and reattaching as the structure coarsens is identified as a mechanism of grain boundary formation. Coarsening the structure results in significant particle detachment with detachment rates that vary drastically with changes in the volume fraction and volume fraction inhomogeneities in the nanostructure. These results demonstrate that particle detachment must be understood to have full control of the nanocrystalline–nanoporous structure and improve material properties.

              Grain boundary formation during coarsening of nanoporous gold (NPG) is investigated wherein a nanocrystalline structure can form by particles detaching and reattaching to the structure. MicroLaue and electron backscatter diffraction measurements demonstrate that an in-grain orientation spread develops as NPG is coarsened. The volume fraction of the NPG sample is near the limit of bicontinuity, at which simulations predict that a bicontinuous structure begins to fragment into independent particles during coarsening. Phase-field simulations of coarsening using a computationally generated structure with a volume fraction near the limit of bicontinuity are used to model particle detachment rates. This model is tested by using the measured NPG structure as an initial condition in the phase-field simulations. We predict that up to

              sample is annealed at 300 °C for 420 min. The quantity of volume detached is found to be highly dependent on the volume fraction and volume fraction homogeneity of the nanostructure. As the void phase in the experiments cannot support independent particles, they must fall and reattach to the structure, a process that results in the formation of new grain boundaries. This particle reattachment process, along with other classic processes, leads to the formation of grain boundaries during coarsening in nanoporous metals. The formation of grain boundaries can impact a variety of applications, including mechanical strengthening; thus, the consideration and understanding of particle detachment phenomena are essential when studying nanoporous metals.},

	abstract = {The surface energy, particularly for nanoparticles, is one of the most important quantities in understanding the thermodynamics of particles. Therefore, it is astonishing that there is still great uncertainty about its value. The uncertainty increases if one questions its dependence on particle size. Different approaches, such as classical thermodynamics calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and ab initio calculations, exist to predict this quantity. Generally, considerations based on classical thermodynamics lead to the prediction of decreasing values of the surface energy with decreasing particle size. This phenomenon is caused by the reduced number of next neighbors of surface atoms with decreasing particle size, a phenomenon that is partly compensated by the reduction of the binding energy between the atoms with decreasing particle size. Furthermore, this compensating effect may be expected by the formation of a disordered or quasi-liquid layer at the surface. The atomistic approach, based either on molecular dynamics simulations or ab initio calculations, generally leads to values with an opposite tendency. However, it is shown that this result is based on an insufficient definition of the particle size. A more realistic definition of the particle size is possible only by a detailed analysis of the electronic structure obtained from initio calculations. Except for minor variations caused by changes in the structure, only a minor dependence of the surface energy on the particle size is found. The main conclusion of this work is that surface energy values for the equivalent bulk materials should be used if detailed data for nanoparticles are not available.},

	abstract = {Plastic deformation in crystalline materials occurs through dislocation slip and strengthening is achieved with obstacles that hinder the motion of dislocations. At relatively low temperatures, dislocations bypass the particles by Orowan looping, particle shearing, cross-slip or a combination of these mechanisms. At elevated temperatures, atomic diffusivity becomes appreciable, so that dislocations can bypass the particles by climb processes. Climb plays a crucial role in the long-term durability or creep resistance of many structural materials, particularly under extreme conditions of load, temperature and radiation. Here we systematically examine dislocation-particle interaction mechanisms. The analysis is based on three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations incorporating impenetrable particles, elastic interactions, dislocation self-climb, cross-slip and glide. The core diffusion dominated dislocation self-climb process is modelled based on a variational principle for the evolution of microstructures, and is coupled with dislocation glide and cross-slip by an adaptive time-stepping scheme to bridge the time scale separation. The stress field caused by particles is implemented based on the particle–matrix mismatch. This model is helpful for understanding the fundamental particle bypass mechanisms and clarifying the effects of dislocation glide, climb and cross-slip on creep deformation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We revisit the meaning of stacking fault energy (SFE) and the assumptions of equilibrium dissociation of lattice dislocations in concentrated alloys. SFE is a unique value in pure metals. However, in alloys beyond the dilute limit, SFE has a distribution of values depending on the local atomic environment. Conventionally, the equilibrium distance between partial dislocations is determined by a balance between the repulsive elastic interaction between the partial dislocations and a unique value for SFE. This assumption is used to determine SFE from experimental measurements of dislocation splitting distances in metals and alloys, often contradicting computational predictions. We use atomistic simulations in a model NiCo alloy to study the dislocation dissociation process in a range of compositions with positive, zero, and negative average SFE and surprisingly observe a stable, finite splitting distance in all cases at low temperatures. We then compute the decorrelation stress and examine the balance of forces on the partial dislocations, considering the local effects on SFE, and observe that even the upper bound of SFE distribution alone cannot satisfy the force balance in some cases. Furthermore, we show that in concentrated solid solutions, the resisting force caused by interaction of dislocations with the local solute environment becomes a major force acting on partial dislocations. Here, we show that the presence of a high solute/dislocation interaction, which is not easy to measure and neglected in experimental measurements of SFE, renders the experimental values of SFE unreliable.},

              CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) was synthesized successfully from elemental powders by mechanical alloying (MA) and subsequent consolidation by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The alloying behavior, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the HEA were assessed using X-ray diffraction, electron microscope, hardness, and compression tests. MA of the elemental powders for 8 h has resulted in a two-phased microstructure:
              α-fcc
              and
              β-bcc
              phases. On the other hand, the consolidated bulk Al

The common neighbor analysis and dislocation extraction algorithm are used to analyze the crystal evolution mechanism of Σ3 grain boundaries to improve the material properties of high-entropy alloys during the tensile test. The results show that compared with the mechanical properties Al0.1CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys without grain boundary, the yield strength and Young’s modulus of a high-entropy alloy containing Σ3 grain boundary are obviously larger than that of high-entropy alloys without grain boundary. Dislocation type includes mainly 1/6{\textless}112{\textgreater} Shockley partial dislocations, a small account of 1/6{\textless}110{\textgreater} Stair-rod, 1/2{\textless}110{\textgreater}perfect dislocation, and 1/3{\textless}111{\textgreater} Hirth dislocations. The mechanical properties of high-entropy alloys are improved by dislocation entanglement and accumulation near the grain boundary.},

          , 
            
              High entropy alloys (HEAs), composed of multiple components with equal or near atomic proportions, have extraordinary mechanical properties and are expected to bear the impact of high-speed forces in armor protection structure materials. In order to understand the deformation behaviour of HEAs under tensile and compressive loading, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to reveal the deformation mechanism and mechanical properties of three crystal structures: Al
              0.1
              CoCrFeNi HEAs without grain boundaries (perfect HEAs), Al
              0.1
              CoCrFeNi HEAs with grain boundaries of Σ3(111)[11̄0] (GBs HEAs) and grain boundaries of Σ3(111)[11̄0] with chemical cluster HEAs (cluster-GBs HEAs). The mechanical properties of the three models at the same strain rate were discussed. Then, the mechanical properties at different strain rates were analyzed. The movement and direction of internal dislocations during the deformation process were investigated. The simulation results show that the GBs HEAs and the cluster-GBs both play an important role in the deformation and failure of the HEAs. Under tensile loading, three behaviour stages of deformation were observed. Cluster-GBs HEAs have a larger yield strength and Young's modulus than that of GBs and perfect HEAs. The higher the strain rate is, the greater the stress reduction rate. Under compressive loading, there are only two behaviour stages of deformation. Cluster-GBs HEAs also have the largest yield strength. Under tensile and compressive deformation, Shockley partial dislocations of 1/6 {\textless}112{\textgreater} are dominant and their moving direction and effect on mechanical properties are discussed.},

            Molecular dynamics is applied to explore the deformation mechanism and crystal structure development of the AlCoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys under nanoimprinting. The influences of crystal structure, alloy composition, grain size, and twin boundary distance on the mechanical properties are carefully analyzed. The imprinting load indicates that the highest loading force is in ascending order with polycrystalline, nano-twinned (NT) polycrystalline, and monocrystalline. The change in alloy composition suggests that the imprinting force increases as the Al content in the alloy increases. The reverse Hall–Petch relation found for the polycrystalline structure, while the Hall–Petch and reverse Hall–Petch relations are discovered in the NT-polycrystalline, which is due to the interactions between the dislocations and grain/twin boundaries (GBs/TBs). The deformation behavior shows that shear strain and local stress are concentrated not only around the punch but also on GBs and adjacent to GBs. The slide and twist of the GBs play a major in controlling the deformation mechanism of polycrystalline structure. The twin boundary migrations are detected during the nanoimprinting of the NT-polycrystalline. Furthermore, the elastic recovery of material is insensitive to changes in alloy composition and grain size, and the formability of the pattern is higher with a decrease in TB distance.},

            A body-centered cubic W-based refractory high entropy alloy with outstanding radiation resistance has been developed. The alloy was grown as thin films showing a bimodal grain size distribution in the nanocrystalline and ultrafine regimes and a unique 4-nm lamella-like structure revealed by atom probe tomography (APT). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray diffraction show certain black spots appearing after thermal annealing at elevated temperatures. TEM and APT analysis correlated the black spots with second-phase particles rich in Cr and V. No sign of irradiation-created dislocation loops, even after 8 dpa, was observed. Furthermore, nanomechanical testing shows a large hardness of 14 GPa in the as-deposited samples, with near negligible irradiation hardening. Theoretical modeling combining ab initio and Monte Carlo techniques predicts the formation of Cr- and V-rich second-phase particles and points at equal mobilities of point defects as the origin of the exceptional radiation tolerance.},

Both show a similar time course, similar pH dependence with a maximum at pH 6.0, and similar sensitivity to inhibitors and to treatment of the chloroplasts with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde. Their light minus dark difference spectra are similar with maxima at about 520 nm. It is concluded that they are manifestations of the same phenomenon, and the slow absorbance increase at 518 nm is due to enhanced scattering.

	abstract = {High-entropy alloys are a new type of material developed in recent years. It breaks the traditional alloy-design conventions and has many excellent properties. High-pressure treatment is an effective means to change the structures and properties of metal materials. The pressure can effectively vary the distance and interaction between molecules or atoms, so as to change the bonding mode, and form high-pressure phases. These new material states often have different structures and characteristics, compared to untreated metal materials. At present, high-pressure technology is an effective method to prepare alloys with unique properties, and there are many techniques that can achieve high pressures. The most commonly used methods include high-pressure torsion, large cavity presses and diamond-anvil-cell presses. The materials show many unique properties under high pressures which do not exist under normal conditions, providing a new approach for the in-depth study of materials. In this paper, high-pressure (HP) technologies applied to high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are reviewed, and some possible ways to develop good properties of HEAs using HP as fabrication are introduced. Moreover, the studies of HEAs under high pressures are summarized, in order to deepen the basic understanding of HEAs under high pressures, which provides the theoretical basis for the application of high-entropy alloys.},

          , 
            Accompanied by enhancements in the ability to fabricate materials for humans, alloy-based materials have advanced from binary alloy systems to complicated compositions along with affording newer applications, which can accelerate the evolution of civilization. Recently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have drawn enormous attention in diverse fields because of their distinctive concept and unique properties. The impressive mechanical properties, such as excellent strength, unforgettable corrosion resistance, and superior thermostability, are inherited and overwhelming compared with traditional alloys. Therefore, HEAs have become an emerging class of advanced materials leading to a new field. Based on the exceptional synthesis methods, HEAs surprisingly afford numerous energy and environmental properties, which have endowed HEAs with promising applications. In this paper, we review the salient features of HEAs and summarize their core effects, phase structures, unconventional synthesis methods, and novel energy and environmental applications. In addition, we also discuss the broad space waiting to be explored and overview fruitful pathways of future trends and prospects.},

This book describes the theoretical background to several variants of these Monte Carlo methods and gives a systematic presentation from which newcomers can learn to perform such simulations and to analyze their results. The fifth edition covers Classical as well as Quantum Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore a new chapter on the sampling of free-energy landscapes has been added. To help students in their work a special web server has been installed to host programs and discussion groups (http://wwwcp.tphys.uni-heidelberg.de). Prof. Binder was awarded the Berni J.

	abstract = {Significance
            This work demonstrates dislocation dynamics in body-centered-cubic (BCC) high-entropy alloys (HEAs). The local composition inhomogeneity in these concentrated solutions leads to an unconventional rate-controlling mechanism that governs dislocation mobility. The activated process becomes nanoscale detrapping, of kinks on screw dislocations and of trapped segments of edge dislocations, presenting an activation barrier of similar magnitude for both dislocation types. Their sluggish mobility explains the elevated strength and strain hardening in BCC HEAs.
          , 
            Atomistic simulations of dislocation mobility reveal that body-centered cubic (BCC) high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are distinctly different from traditional BCC metals. HEAs are concentrated solutions in which composition fluctuation is almost inevitable. The resultant inhomogeneities, while locally promoting kink nucleation on screw dislocations, trap them against propagation with an appreciable energy barrier, replacing kink nucleation as the rate-limiting mechanism. Edge dislocations encounter a similar activated process of nanoscale segment detrapping, with comparable activation barrier. As a result, the mobility of edge dislocations, and hence their contribution to strength, becomes comparable to screw dislocations.},

	abstract = {Nanoporous ultrathin films, constituted by a slab less than 100 nm thick and a certain void volume fraction provided by nanopores, are emerging as a new class of systems with a wide range of possible applications, including electrochemistry, energy storage, gas sensing and supercapacitors. The film porosity and morphology strongly affect nanoporous films mechanical properties, the knowledge of which is fundamental for designing films for specific applications. To unveil the relationships among the morphology, structure and mechanical response, a comprehensive and non-destructive investigation of a model system was sought. In this review, we examined the paradigmatic case of a nanoporous, granular, metallic ultrathin film with comprehensive bottom-up and top-down approaches, both experimentals and theoreticals. The granular film was made of Ag nanoparticles deposited by gas-phase synthesis, thus providing a solvent-free and ultrapure nanoporous system at room temperature. The results, bearing generality beyond the specific model system, are discussed for several applications specific to the morphological and mechanical properties of the investigated films, including bendable electronics, membrane separation and nanofluidic sensing.},

	abstract = {The surface energy, particularly for nanoparticles, is one of the most important quantities in understanding the thermodynamics of particles. Therefore, it is astonishing that there is still great uncertainty about its value. The uncertainty increases if one questions its dependence on particle size. Different approaches, such as classical thermodynamics calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and ab initio calculations, exist to predict this quantity. Generally, considerations based on classical thermodynamics lead to the prediction of decreasing values of the surface energy with decreasing particle size. This phenomenon is caused by the reduced number of next neighbors of surface atoms with decreasing particle size, a phenomenon that is partly compensated by the reduction of the binding energy between the atoms with decreasing particle size. Furthermore, this compensating effect may be expected by the formation of a disordered or quasi-liquid layer at the surface. The atomistic approach, based either on molecular dynamics simulations or ab initio calculations, generally leads to values with an opposite tendency. However, it is shown that this result is based on an insufficient definition of the particle size. A more realistic definition of the particle size is possible only by a detailed analysis of the electronic structure obtained from initio calculations. Except for minor variations caused by changes in the structure, only a minor dependence of the surface energy on the particle size is found. The main conclusion of this work is that surface energy values for the equivalent bulk materials should be used if detailed data for nanoparticles are not available.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Nanoporous metals are prototypical bicontinuous structures that have a large surface area and many applications. We demonstrate that an in-grain orientation spread develops during coarsening in nanoporous metals, leading to the formation of a nanocrystalline–nanoporous structure. The process of particles detaching and reattaching as the structure coarsens is identified as a mechanism of grain boundary formation. Coarsening the structure results in significant particle detachment with detachment rates that vary drastically with changes in the volume fraction and volume fraction inhomogeneities in the nanostructure. These results demonstrate that particle detachment must be understood to have full control of the nanocrystalline–nanoporous structure and improve material properties.
          , 
            
              Grain boundary formation during coarsening of nanoporous gold (NPG) is investigated wherein a nanocrystalline structure can form by particles detaching and reattaching to the structure. MicroLaue and electron backscatter diffraction measurements demonstrate that an in-grain orientation spread develops as NPG is coarsened. The volume fraction of the NPG sample is near the limit of bicontinuity, at which simulations predict that a bicontinuous structure begins to fragment into independent particles during coarsening. Phase-field simulations of coarsening using a computationally generated structure with a volume fraction near the limit of bicontinuity are used to model particle detachment rates. This model is tested by using the measured NPG structure as an initial condition in the phase-field simulations. We predict that up to

              sample is annealed at 300 °C for 420 min. The quantity of volume detached is found to be highly dependent on the volume fraction and volume fraction homogeneity of the nanostructure. As the void phase in the experiments cannot support independent particles, they must fall and reattach to the structure, a process that results in the formation of new grain boundaries. This particle reattachment process, along with other classic processes, leads to the formation of grain boundaries during coarsening in nanoporous metals. The formation of grain boundaries can impact a variety of applications, including mechanical strengthening; thus, the consideration and understanding of particle detachment phenomena are essential when studying nanoporous metals.},

	abstract = {Plastic deformation in crystalline materials occurs through dislocation slip and strengthening is achieved with obstacles that hinder the motion of dislocations. At relatively low temperatures, dislocations bypass the particles by Orowan looping, particle shearing, cross-slip or a combination of these mechanisms. At elevated temperatures, atomic diffusivity becomes appreciable, so that dislocations can bypass the particles by climb processes. Climb plays a crucial role in the long-term durability or creep resistance of many structural materials, particularly under extreme conditions of load, temperature and radiation. Here we systematically examine dislocation-particle interaction mechanisms. The analysis is based on three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations incorporating impenetrable particles, elastic interactions, dislocation self-climb, cross-slip and glide. The core diffusion dominated dislocation self-climb process is modelled based on a variational principle for the evolution of microstructures, and is coupled with dislocation glide and cross-slip by an adaptive time-stepping scheme to bridge the time scale separation. The stress field caused by particles is implemented based on the particle–matrix mismatch. This model is helpful for understanding the fundamental particle bypass mechanisms and clarifying the effects of dislocation glide, climb and cross-slip on creep deformation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We revisit the meaning of stacking fault energy (SFE) and the assumptions of equilibrium dissociation of lattice dislocations in concentrated alloys. SFE is a unique value in pure metals. However, in alloys beyond the dilute limit, SFE has a distribution of values depending on the local atomic environment. Conventionally, the equilibrium distance between partial dislocations is determined by a balance between the repulsive elastic interaction between the partial dislocations and a unique value for SFE. This assumption is used to determine SFE from experimental measurements of dislocation splitting distances in metals and alloys, often contradicting computational predictions. We use atomistic simulations in a model NiCo alloy to study the dislocation dissociation process in a range of compositions with positive, zero, and negative average SFE and surprisingly observe a stable, finite splitting distance in all cases at low temperatures. We then compute the decorrelation stress and examine the balance of forces on the partial dislocations, considering the local effects on SFE, and observe that even the upper bound of SFE distribution alone cannot satisfy the force balance in some cases. Furthermore, we show that in concentrated solid solutions, the resisting force caused by interaction of dislocations with the local solute environment becomes a major force acting on partial dislocations. Here, we show that the presence of a high solute/dislocation interaction, which is not easy to measure and neglected in experimental measurements of SFE, renders the experimental values of SFE unreliable.},

              CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) was synthesized successfully from elemental powders by mechanical alloying (MA) and subsequent consolidation by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The alloying behavior, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the HEA were assessed using X-ray diffraction, electron microscope, hardness, and compression tests. MA of the elemental powders for 8 h has resulted in a two-phased microstructure:
              α-fcc
              and
              β-bcc
              phases. On the other hand, the consolidated bulk Al
              0.1
              CoCrFeNi-HEA sample reveals the presence of
              α-fcc

              transforms into a stable
              α-fcc
              during the SPS process due to the supply of thermal energy. The hardness of the consolidated bulk HEA samples is found to be 370 ± 50 HV
              0.5
              , and the yield and ultimate compressive strengths are found to be 1420 and 1600 MPa, respectively. Such high strength in the Al

In this work, the molecular dynamics method is used to calculate the tensile properties of face-centered cubic Al0.1CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys containing Σ3 grain boundaries and without grain boundary. The atomic model was established by the melting rapid cooling method, then stretched by the static drawing method. The common neighbor analysis and dislocation extraction algorithm are used to analyze the crystal evolution mechanism of Σ3 grain boundaries to improve the material properties of high-entropy alloys during the tensile test. The results show that compared with the mechanical properties Al0.1CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys without grain boundary, the yield strength and Young’s modulus of a high-entropy alloy containing Σ3 grain boundary are obviously larger than that of high-entropy alloys without grain boundary. Dislocation type includes mainly 1/6{\textless}112{\textgreater} Shockley partial dislocations, a small account of 1/6{\textless}110{\textgreater} Stair-rod, 1/2{\textless}110{\textgreater}perfect dislocation, and 1/3{\textless}111{\textgreater} Hirth dislocations. The mechanical properties of high-entropy alloys are improved by dislocation entanglement and accumulation near the grain boundary.},

          , 
            
              High entropy alloys (HEAs), composed of multiple components with equal or near atomic proportions, have extraordinary mechanical properties and are expected to bear the impact of high-speed forces in armor protection structure materials. In order to understand the deformation behaviour of HEAs under tensile and compressive loading, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to reveal the deformation mechanism and mechanical properties of three crystal structures: Al
              0.1
              CoCrFeNi HEAs without grain boundaries (perfect HEAs), Al
              0.1
              CoCrFeNi HEAs with grain boundaries of Σ3(111)[11̄0] (GBs HEAs) and grain boundaries of Σ3(111)[11̄0] with chemical cluster HEAs (cluster-GBs HEAs). The mechanical properties of the three models at the same strain rate were discussed. Then, the mechanical properties at different strain rates were analyzed. The movement and direction of internal dislocations during the deformation process were investigated. The simulation results show that the GBs HEAs and the cluster-GBs both play an important role in the deformation and failure of the HEAs. Under tensile loading, three behaviour stages of deformation were observed. Cluster-GBs HEAs have a larger yield strength and Young's modulus than that of GBs and perfect HEAs. The higher the strain rate is, the greater the stress reduction rate. Under compressive loading, there are only two behaviour stages of deformation. Cluster-GBs HEAs also have the largest yield strength. Under tensile and compressive deformation, Shockley partial dislocations of 1/6 {\textless}112{\textgreater} are dominant and their moving direction and effect on mechanical properties are discussed.},

            Molecular dynamics is applied to explore the deformation mechanism and crystal structure development of the AlCoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys under nanoimprinting. The influences of crystal structure, alloy composition, grain size, and twin boundary distance on the mechanical properties are carefully analyzed. The imprinting load indicates that the highest loading force is in ascending order with polycrystalline, nano-twinned (NT) polycrystalline, and monocrystalline. The change in alloy composition suggests that the imprinting force increases as the Al content in the alloy increases. The reverse Hall–Petch relation found for the polycrystalline structure, while the Hall–Petch and reverse Hall–Petch relations are discovered in the NT-polycrystalline, which is due to the interactions between the dislocations and grain/twin boundaries (GBs/TBs). The deformation behavior shows that shear strain and local stress are concentrated not only around the punch but also on GBs and adjacent to GBs. The slide and twist of the GBs play a major in controlling the deformation mechanism of polycrystalline structure. The twin boundary migrations are detected during the nanoimprinting of the NT-polycrystalline. Furthermore, the elastic recovery of material is insensitive to changes in alloy composition and grain size, and the formability of the pattern is higher with a decrease in TB distance.},

          , 
            A body-centered cubic W-based refractory high entropy alloy with outstanding radiation resistance has been developed. The alloy was grown as thin films showing a bimodal grain size distribution in the nanocrystalline and ultrafine regimes and a unique 4-nm lamella-like structure revealed by atom probe tomography (APT). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray diffraction show certain black spots appearing after thermal annealing at elevated temperatures. TEM and APT analysis correlated the black spots with second-phase particles rich in Cr and V. No sign of irradiation-created dislocation loops, even after 8 dpa, was observed. Furthermore, nanomechanical testing shows a large hardness of 14 GPa in the as-deposited samples, with near negligible irradiation hardening. Theoretical modeling combining ab initio and Monte Carlo techniques predicts the formation of Cr- and V-rich second-phase particles and points at equal mobilities of point defects as the origin of the exceptional radiation tolerance.},

The slow component of the 518 nm absorbance change correlates with the light-induced change in 90 degrees light scattering at 518 nm. Both show a similar time course, similar pH dependence with a maximum at pH 6.0, and similar sensitivity to inhibitors and to treatment of the chloroplasts with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde. Their light minus dark difference spectra are similar with maxima at about 520 nm. It is concluded that they are manifestations of the same phenomenon, and the slow absorbance increase at 518 nm is due to enhanced scattering. It is proposed that the light-induced changes in scattering at 518 nm reflect alterations in selective dispersion, due to proton uptake and conformational changes in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane.},

	abstract = {High-entropy alloys are a new type of material developed in recent years. It breaks the traditional alloy-design conventions and has many excellent properties. High-pressure treatment is an effective means to change the structures and properties of metal materials. The pressure can effectively vary the distance and interaction between molecules or atoms, so as to change the bonding mode, and form high-pressure phases. These new material states often have different structures and characteristics, compared to untreated metal materials. At present, high-pressure technology is an effective method to prepare alloys with unique properties, and there are many techniques that can achieve high pressures. The most commonly used methods include high-pressure torsion, large cavity presses and diamond-anvil-cell presses. The materials show many unique properties under high pressures which do not exist under normal conditions, providing a new approach for the in-depth study of materials. In this paper, high-pressure (HP) technologies applied to high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are reviewed, and some possible ways to develop good properties of HEAs using HP as fabrication are introduced. Moreover, the studies of HEAs under high pressures are summarized, in order to deepen the basic understanding of HEAs under high pressures, which provides the theoretical basis for the application of high-entropy alloys.},

            Accompanied by enhancements in the ability to fabricate materials for humans, alloy-based materials have advanced from binary alloy systems to complicated compositions along with affording newer applications, which can accelerate the evolution of civilization. Recently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have drawn enormous attention in diverse fields because of their distinctive concept and unique properties. The impressive mechanical properties, such as excellent strength, unforgettable corrosion resistance, and superior thermostability, are inherited and overwhelming compared with traditional alloys. Therefore, HEAs have become an emerging class of advanced materials leading to a new field. Based on the exceptional synthesis methods, HEAs surprisingly afford numerous energy and environmental properties, which have endowed HEAs with promising applications. In this paper, we review the salient features of HEAs and summarize their core effects, phase structures, unconventional synthesis methods, and novel energy and environmental applications. In addition, we also discuss the broad space waiting to be explored and overview fruitful pathways of future trends and prospects.},

	abstract = {Conventional first-principle approaches for studying nonequilibrium processes depend on the mechanics of individual particles or quantum states and as a result require many details of the mechanical features of the system to arrive at a macroscopic property. In contrast, thermodynamics, which has been successful in the stable equilibrium realm, provides an approach for determining macroscopic properties without the mechanical details. Nonetheless, this phenomenological approach is not generally applicable to a nonequilibrium process except in the near-equilibrium realm and under the local equilibrium and continuum assumptions, both of which limit its ability to describe nonequilibrium phenomena. Furthermore, predicting the thermodynamic features of a nonequilibrium process (of entropy generation) across all scales is difficult. To address these drawbacks, steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT) can be used. It provides a first-principle thermodynamic-ensemble based approach applicable to the entire nonequilibrium realm even that far-from-equilibrium and does so with a single kinematics and dynamics, which crosses all temporal and spatial scales. Based on prior developments by the authors, SEAQT is used here to study the heat and mass diffusion of indistinguishable particles. The study focuses on the thermodynamic features of far-from-equilibrium state evolution, which is separated from the specific mechanics of individual particle interactions. Results for nonequilibrium size (volume) and concentration effects on the evolutionary state trajectory are presented for the case of high temperature and low particle concentration, which, however, do not impact the generality of the theory and will in future studies be relaxed.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Oxygen reduction in a solid oxide fuel cell cathode involves a nonequilibrium process of coupled mass and heat diffusion and electrochemical and chemical reactions. These phenomena occur at multiple temporal and spatial scales, making the modeling, especially in the transient regime, very difficult. Nonetheless, multiscale models are needed to improve the understanding of oxygen reduction and guide cathode design. Of particular importance for long-term operation are microstructure degradation and chromium oxide poisoning both of which degrade cathode performance. Existing methods are phenomenological or empirical in nature and their application limited to the continuum realm with quantum effects not captured. In contrast, steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics can be used to model nonequilibrium processes (even those far-from equilibrium) at all scales. The nonequilibrium relaxation is characterized by entropy generation, which can unify coupled phenomena into one framework to model transient and steady behavior. The results reveal the effects on performance of the different timescales of the varied phenomena involved and their coupling. Results are included here for the effects of chromium oxide concentrations on cathode output as is a parametric study of the effects of interconnect-three-phase-boundary length, oxygen mean free path, and adsorption site effectiveness. A qualitative comparison with experimental results is made.},

	abstract = {Suppression of carbon contamination in GaN films grown using metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) is a crucial issue in its application to high power and high frequency electronic devices. To know how to reduce the C concentration in the films, a sequential analysis based on first principles calculations is performed. Thus, surface reconstruction and the adsorption of the CH4 produced by the decomposition of the Ga source, Ga(CH3)3, and its incorporation into the GaN sub-surface layers are investigated. In this sequential analysis, the dataset of the adsorption probability of CH4 on reconstructed surfaces is indispensable, as is the energy of the C impurity in the GaN sub-surface layers. The C adsorption probability is obtained based on steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT). SEAQT is a thermodynamic ensemble-based, non-phenomenological framework that can predict the behavior of non-equilibrium processes, even those far from equilibrium. This framework is suitable especially when one studies the adsorption behavior of an impurity molecule because the conventional approach, the chemical potential control method, cannot be applied to a quantitative analysis for such a system. The proposed sequential model successfully explains the influence of the growth orientation, GaN(0001) and (000−1), on the incorporation of C into the film. This model can contribute to the suppression of the C contamination in GaN MOVPE.},

              The steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic (SEAQT) framework was used to calculate the stability of a collection of point defects in 2D PtSe
              2
              and predict the kinetics with which defects rearrange during thermal annealing. The framework provides a non-equilibrium, ensemble-based framework with a self-consistent link between mechanics (both quantum and classical) and thermodynamics. It employs an equation of motion derived from the principle of steepest entropy ascent (maximum entropy production) to predict the time evolution of a set of occupation probabilities that define the states of a system undergoing a non-equilibrium process. The system is described by a degenerate energy landscape of eigenvalues, and the entropy is found from the occupation probabilities and the eigenlevel degeneracies. Scanning tunneling microscopy was used to identify the structure and distribution of point defects observed experimentally in a 2D PtSe
              2
              film. A catalog of observed defects includes six unique point defects (vacancies and anti-site defects on Pt and Se sublattices) and twenty combinations of multiple point defects in close proximity. The defect energies were estimated with density functional theory, while the degeneracies, or density of states, for the 2D film with all possible combinations or arrangements of cataloged defects was constructed using a non-Markovian Monte-Carlo approach (i.e. the Replica–Exchange–Wang–Landau algorithm (Vogel

              unit cells in area (total of 5400 atoms). The SEAQT equation of motion was applied to the energy landscape to determine how an arbitrary density and arrangement of the six defect types evolve during annealing.

	abstract = {The steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic (SEAQT) framework is used to explore the influence of heating and cooling on polymer chain folding kinetics. The framework predicts how a chain moves from an initial non-equilibrium state to stable equilibrium along a unique thermodynamic path. The thermodynamic state is expressed by occupation probabilities corresponding to the levels of a discrete energy landscape. The landscape is generated using the Replica Exchange Wang–Landau method applied to a polymer chain represented by a sequence of hydrophobic and polar monomers with a simple hydrophobic-polar amino acid model. The chain conformation evolves as energy shifts among the levels of the energy landscape according to the principle of steepest entropy ascent. This principle is implemented via the SEAQT equation of motion. The SEAQT framework has the benefit of providing insight into structural properties under non-equilibrium conditions. Chain conformations during heating and cooling change continuously without sharp transitions in morphology. The changes are more drastic along non-equilibrium paths than along quasi-equilibrium paths. The SEAQT-predicted kinetics are fitted to rates associated with the experimental intensity profiles of cytochrome c protein folding with Rouse dynamics.},

If no dispersion is assumed, a large, nonphysical discontinuity is found in the transverse phonon relaxation time over the entire temperature range. However, this effect is masked in the final prediction of the thermal conductivity by the use of fitting parameters. As the treatment of the dispersion is refined, the magnitude of the discontinuity is reduced. At the same time, discrepancies between the high temperature predictions and experimental data become apparent, indicating that the assumed heat transfer mechanisms (i.e., the relaxation time models) are not sufficient to account for the expected thermal transport. Molecular dynamics simulations may be the most suitable tool available for addressing this issue.},

	abstract = {The Bi2Te3, Bi1.9Lu0.1Te3 and Bi1.9Tm0.1Te3 thermoelectrics of n-type conductivity have been prepared by the microwave-solvothermal method and spark plasma sintering. These compounds behave as degenerate semiconductors from room temperature up to temperature Td ≈ 470 K. Within this temperature range the temperature behavior of the specific electrical resistivity is due to the temperature changes of electron mobility determined by acoustic and optical phonon scattering. Above Td, an onset of intrinsic conductivity takes place when electrons and holes are present. At the Lu and Tm doping, the Seebeck coefficient increases, while the specific electrical resistivity and total thermal conductivity decrease within the temperature 290–630 K range. The increase of the electrical resistivity is related to the increase of electron concentration since the Tm and Lu atoms are donor centres in the Bi2Te3 lattice. The increase of the density-of-state effective mass for conduction band can be responsible for the increase of the Seebeck coefficient. The decrease of the total thermal conductivity in doped Bi2Te3 is attributed to point defects like the antisite defects and Lu or Tm atoms substituting for the Bi sites. In addition, reducing the electron thermal conductivity due to forming a narrow impurity (Lu or Tm) band having high and sharp density-of-states near the Fermi level can effectively decrease the total thermal conductivity. The thermoelectric figure-of-merit is enhanced from ∼ 0.4 for undoped Bi2Te3 up to ∼ 0.7 for Bi1.9Tm0.1Te3 and ∼ 0.9 for Bi1.9Lu0.1Te3.},

Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3)-based thermoelectric materials exhibit very low levels of thermal conductivity. In this study, a Te crystal-embedded Bi2Te3 (Te–Bi2Te3) thin film was formed by establishing a specific annealing temperature for a Te-rich Bi/Te multilayered structure. Modulations in structure and composition were observed at the boundaries between the two phases of Te and Bi2Te3. Furthermore, the samples contained regularly shaped nanometer-scale Bi2Te3 single grains. Therefore, we obtained a dramatic ZT value of 2.27 (+ 0.04, − 0.08) at 375 K from the Te–Bi2Te3 thin film. Finally, we confirmed that interface phonon scattering between the Te–Bi2Te3 boundaries plays an important role in inter-grain phonon transport, which results in a reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity.},

Such epitaxial nature between Bi2Te3 nanoplates and Te nanorods is caused by their negligible lattice mismatches in the corresponding atomic planes.

	abstract = {In this paper, Bi2Te3 nanosheets were firstly synthesized by solvothermal method, and then Ti3C2Tx (indicating O, F, OH, etc.) was introduced into bismuth telluride nanosheets with good thermoelectric properties as the second phase by the composite method of “ultrasonic dispersion-flash freeze-drying” combined with discharge plasma sintering technique, and the Bi2Te3/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites were successfully prepared. The effects of different contents of Ti3C2 T x on the thermoelectric properties of Bi2 Te3/Ti3C2 T x nanocomposites were also investigated. The samples were characterized and performance tested using scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, thermoelectric test system, and laser thermal conductivity meter. The results show that the introduction of titanium carbide into the bismuth telluride nanomatrix increases the carrier concentration of bismuth telluride, leading to an increase in conductivity and a decrease in Seebeck coefficient, but the energy barrier scattering at the composite interface avoids a significant decrease in Seebeck coefficient; the nanocrystalline boundary between titanium carbide and bismuth telluride increases phonon scattering and interfacial thermal resistance and decreases thermal conductivity. The 1 vol\% bismuth Bi2Te3/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites showed a 25\% increase in thermoelectric figure of merit compared to the bismuth Bi2Te3 nanomatrix. 1 vol\% Bi3Te3/Ti3C2T x nanocomposites had the highest ZT value of 0.908 at 432 K and the average ZT value of 0.87 in the range of376-511 K.},

            Refractory multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) have exceptional mechanical properties, including high strength-to-weight ratio and fracture toughness, at high temperatures. Here we elucidate the complex interplay between segregation, short-range order, and strengthening in the NbMoTaW MPEA through atomistic simulations with a highly accurate machine learning interatomic potential. In the single crystal MPEA, we find greatly reduced anisotropy in the critically resolved shear stress between screw and edge dislocations compared to the elemental metals. In the polycrystalline MPEA, we demonstrate that thermodynamically driven Nb segregation to the grain boundaries (GBs) and W enrichment within the grains intensifies the observed short-range order (SRO). The increased GB stability due to Nb enrichment reduces the von Mises strain, resulting in higher strength than a random solid solution MPEA. These results highlight the need to simultaneously tune GB composition and bulk SRO to tailor the mechanical properties of MPEAs.},

any adjustment parameters. New insights of the energy conservation surface calculation, involved in phonon-phonon time relaxation

range from 50K to 1000K in bulk silicon. We especially focused our attention on the thermal conductivity as a function of
the phonon anharmonic resistive mechanisms for two models of dispersion: “linear” and “quadratic”. We demonstrate that very

For the calculation of module design the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical as well as thermal properties of silicon in the high-temperature range are of great importance. In this study, we evaluate the thermoelectric properties of low-, medium-, and high-doped silicon from room temperature to 900 K.

	abstract = {A material strength depends on its microstructure, which in turn, is controlled by an engineering process. Strengthening mechanisms like work hardening, precipitate, and grain boundary strengthening can alter the strength of a material in a predictive, quantitative manner and are readily linked to the deformation mechanism. This quantification strongly depends on the characteristic length scale of a particular microstructure, thereby dictating bulk material’s strength as a function of, for example, grain or precipitate size, twin boundary spacing, or dislocation density. This microstructural, or intrinsic, size governs the mechanical properties and post-elastic material deformation at all sample dimensions, as the classical definition of “ultimate tensile strength” deems it to be “an intensive property, therefore its value does not depend on the size of the test specimen.” Yet in the last 5years, the vast majority of uniaxial deformation experiments and computations on small-scale metallic structures unambiguously demonstrated that at the micron and sub-micron scales, this definition no longer holds true. In fact, it has been shown that in single crystals the ultimate tensile strength and the yield strength scale with external sample size in a power law fashion, sometimes attaining a significant fraction of material’s theoretical strength, and exhibiting the now-commonly-known phenomenon “smaller is stronger.” Understanding of this “extrinsic size effect” at small scales is not yet mature and is currently a topic of rigorous investigations. As both the intrinsic (i.e. microstructural) and extrinsic (i.e. sample size) dimensions play a non-trivial role in the mechanical properties and material deformation mechanisms, it is critical to develop an understanding of their interplay and mutual effects on the mechanical properties and material deformation, especially in small-scale structures. This review focuses on providing an overview of metal-based material classes whose properties as a function of external size have been investigated and provides a critical discussion on the combined effects of intrinsic and extrinsic sizes on the material deformation behavior.},

By studying the deformation characteristics of three FCC materials with disparate stacking fault energies (gold, copper and nickel), we ﬁnd that the deformation mechanisms in the nanowires are a function of the intrinsic material properties, applied stress state, axial crystallographic orientation and exposed transverse surfaces. The key ﬁnding of this work is the ﬁrst order effect that side surface orientation has on the operant mode of inelastic deformation in both h1 0 0i and h1 1 0i nanowires. Comparisons to expected deformation modes, as calculated using crystallographic Schmid factors for tension and compression, are provided to illustrate how transverse surface orientations can directly alter the deformation mechanisms in materials with nanometer scale dimensions.},

With the aim of enhancing the hardness of aluminium nitride (19 GPa), the present study on the proposed combinations reveal that B0.75Al0.25N (40.5 GPa) and B0.875Al0.125N (49.5 GPa) alloys turn out to be superhard materials as their hardness surpasses 40 GPa. Further, B0.875Al0.125N alloy has been identified to serve as a good thermoelectric as it has a high Seebeck coefficient value of 240 µV/K and of melting temperature of 4282 K. Except for the binary compounds AlN and BN, all the other ternary alloys are predicted to be direct band gap materials.

	abstract = {Over the last decade, progress in wide bandgap, III-V materials systems based on gallium nitride (GaN) has been a major driver in the realization of high power and high frequency electronic devices. Since the highly conductive, two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the AlGaN/GaN interface is based on built-in polarization fields (not doping) and is confined to very small thicknesses, its charge carriers exhibit much higher mobilities in comparison to their doped counterparts. In this study, we show that this heterostructured material also offers the unique ability to manipulate electrical transport separately from thermal transport through the examination of fully-suspended AlGaN/GaN diaphragms of varied GaN buffer layer thicknesses. Notably, we show that {\textasciitilde}100 nm thin GaN layers can considerably impede heat flow ({\textasciitilde}5x lower thermal conductivity in comparison with bulk GaN) without electrical transport degradation, and that a significant improvement ({\textasciitilde}4x) in the thermoelectric figure of merit over externally doped GaN is observed in 2DEG based heterostructures. This remarkable tuning behavior and thermoelectric enhancement, elucidated here for the first time in a polarization-based heterostructure, is achieved since the electrons are at the heterostructured interface, while the phonons are within the material system.},

The contributions of the elastic constants, thermal conductivity, thermal energy density, ultrasonic velocity and acoustic coupling constant to the total attenuation are studied. On the basis of the ultrasonic attenuation, it can be concluded that the AlN is more ductile than either GaN or InN at 300K.

	abstract = {Small modular reactors (SMRs; i.e., nuclear reactors that produce {\textless}300 MWelec each) have garnered attention because of claims of inherent safety features and reduced cost. However, remarkably few studies have analyzed the management and disposal of their nuclear waste streams. Here, we compare three distinct SMR designs to an 1,100-MWelec pressurized water reactor in terms of the energy-equivalent volume, (radio-)chemistry, decay heat, and fissile isotope composition of (notional) high-, intermediate-, and low-level waste streams. Results reveal that water-, molten salt–, and sodium-cooled SMR designs will increase the volume of nuclear waste in need of management and disposal by factors of 2 to 30. The excess waste volume is attributed to the use of neutron reflectors and/or of chemically reactive fuels and coolants in SMR designs. That said, volume is not the most important evaluation metric; rather, geologic repository performance is driven by the decay heat power and the (radio-)chemistry of spent nuclear fuel, for which SMRs provide no benefit. SMRs will not reduce the generation of geochemically mobile 129I, 99Tc, and 79Se fission products, which are important dose contributors for most repository designs. In addition, SMR spent fuel will contain relatively high concentrations of fissile nuclides, which will demand novel approaches to evaluating criticality during storage and disposal. Since waste stream properties are influenced by neutron leakage, a basic physical process that is enhanced in small reactor cores, SMRs will exacerbate the challenges of nuclear waste management and disposal.},

Our calculations utilized a local density approximation (LDA) potential and the linear combination of Gaussian orbitals (LCGO). Unlike some other density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we employed the Bagayoko, Zhao, and Williams' method, enhanced by Ekuma and Franklin (BZW-EF). The BZW-EF method verifiably leads to the minima of the occupied energies; these minima, the low laying unoccupied energies, and related wave functions provide the most variationally and physically valid density functional theory (DFT) description of the ground states of materials under study. With multiple oxidation states of Al (Al3+ to Al) and the availability of N3− to N, the BZW-EF method required several sets of self-consistent calculations with different ionic species as input. The binding energy for (Al3+\& N3−) as input was 1.5 eV larger in magnitude than those for other input choices; the results discussed here are those from the calculation that led to the absolute minima of the occupied energies with this input. Our calculated, direct band gap for w-AlN, at the Γ point, is 6.28 eV, in excellent agreement with the 6.28 eV experimental value at 5K.

The peculiarities in measured κ(T) suggest that the phonon scattering from point defects contributes essentially to the total phonon scattering in samples under investigation at low temperatures. The phonon interaction with electrons and holes bound to neutral donor and acceptor centers is suggested, adding substantially to thermal resistivity near and below the peak in κ(T).},

	abstract = {Dislocations in high entropy alloys (HEAs) are wavy and have natural pinning points due to the variable chemical and energetic landscape surrounding the dislocation core. This can influence the critical shear stress necessary to initiate dislocation motion and the details associated with sustained dislocation glide. The objective of this work is to determine the relationship between Schmid shear stress and dislocation velocity in single phase FCC FeNiCrCoCu HEAs using molecular dynamics simulations, with comparisons made to dislocation motion in homogeneous Ni and Cu. Simulations are performed for four different dislocation character angles: 0° (screw), 30°, 60° and 90° (edge). Several key differences are reported, compared to what is previously known about dislocation motion in homogeneous FCC metals. For example, the drag coefficient B in the phonon damping regime for HEAs has a nonlinear dependence on temperature, whereas this dependence is linear in Ni. Mobility relationships between different types of dislocations common in homogeneous FCC metals, such as the velocity of screw and 60° dislocations being lower than edge and 30° dislocations at the same shear stress, do not necessarily hold in HEAs. Dislocation waviness is measured and is found to correlate with the ability of dislocations to glide under an applied shear stress, including the temperature dependence of the drag coefficient B. These results confirm that the influence of HEA chemical complexity on dislocation motion is important and this data can be used to guide development of analytical or empirical models for dislocation mobility in HEAs.},

	abstract = {A material strength depends on its microstructure, which in turn, is controlled by an engineering process. Strengthening mechanisms like work hardening, precipitate, and grain boundary strengthening can alter the strength of a material in a predictive, quantitative manner and are readily linked to the deformation mechanism. This quantification strongly depends on the characteristic length scale of a particular microstructure, thereby dictating bulk material’s strength as a function of, for example, grain or precipitate size, twin boundary spacing, or dislocation density. This microstructural, or intrinsic, size governs the mechanical properties and post-elastic material deformation at all sample dimensions, as the classical definition of “ultimate tensile strength” deems it to be “an intensive property, therefore its value does not depend on the size of the test specimen.” Yet in the last 5years, the vast majority of uniaxial deformation experiments and computations on small-scale metallic structures unambiguously demonstrated that at the micron and sub-micron scales, this definition no longer holds true. In fact, it has been shown that in single crystals the ultimate tensile strength and the yield strength scale with external sample size in a power law fashion, sometimes attaining a significant fraction of material’s theoretical strength, and exhibiting the now-commonly-known phenomenon “smaller is stronger.” Understanding of this “extrinsic size effect” at small scales is not yet mature and is currently a topic of rigorous investigations. As both the intrinsic (i.e. microstructural) and extrinsic (i.e. sample size) dimensions play a non-trivial role in the mechanical properties and material deformation mechanisms, it is critical to develop an understanding of their interplay and mutual effects on the mechanical properties and material deformation, especially in small-scale structures. This review focuses on providing an overview of metal-based material classes whose properties as a function of external size have been investigated and provides a critical discussion on the combined effects of intrinsic and extrinsic sizes on the material deformation behavior.},

We investigated the inhomogeneous microtexture evolution of gold wire that was cold drawn through an asymmetric diamond die. In this study, the distributions of the {\textless}111{\textgreater} and {\textless}100{\textgreater} textures in a 20 μm diameter fine gold wire are the variables and their effects on the bonding stability of the wire were estimated by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and finite element method (FEM) simulations. The use of a focused ion beam apparatus enabled a high quality of band contrast of the EBSD to be achieved in the exact half cross-sectional area of the fine gold wire. The detailed three-dimensional FEM results show that the asymmetric distribution of the textures plays a crucial role in increasing the spatial displacement of the gold bonding wire.},

It is shown that small (whether in physical size or power level) reactors are not new, but offer economic and flexibility advantages that allow their use in a variety of applications. The different definitions of modularity are reviewed, including modularity in design, process intensification, manufacturing and construction. It is shown that these forms of modularity when applied to SMRs have some advantages, but also have some challenges that need to be addressed if their full potential is to be realized. Even if these forms of modularity are not fully utilized, the lower power (≤300 MW electrical) of SMRs allows the formation of larger power plants by incremental addition of reactor units, in the so-called scale modularity. The paper reviews the unique features of emerging SMR designs, and compares them to those of the early era of nuclear power. It is shown that while many modern SMR designs incorporate well-proven features that were tested and proven in early reactors. others introduce aspects of Generation IV reactors, in terms of inherent and/or passive safety. Given the promise of SMRs as means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their ability to supply reliable and base-load power, the licensing of such reactors by national regulators will provide a boost to their acceptability and adaptability as a player in combating climate change.},

Simulation results showed that various VC defects changed the energy band and localized electron density distribution of Si crystals and caused the band gap to decrease with increasing VC size. The results can be ascribed to the formation of a defect level produced by the dangling bonds, floating bonds, or high-strain atoms surrounding the VC defects. The appearance of imaginary frequencies in the phonon spectrum of defective Si crystals indicates that the defect-region structure is dynamically unstable and demonstrates phase changes. The phonon dispersion relation and phonon density of state were also investigated using density functional perturbation theory.

              = 42 K and a maximum value of 671 K at the high-temperature limit, which is consistent with the experimental results reported by Flubacher. Moreover, the Debye temperature decreased with increases in the VC size. VC defects had minimal effects on the heat capacity (

As the temperature was higher than 150 K, the heat capacity gradually increased with increasing temperature until it achieved a constant value of 11.8 cal/cell·K. The heat capacity significantly decreased as the VC size increased. For a 2 × 2 × 2 superlattice Si crystal containing a hexagonal ring VC (HRVC10), the heat capacity decreased by approximately 17\%.},

	abstract = {Going through decades of development, great progress in both theory and experiment has been achieved in thermoelectric materials. With the growing enhancement in thermoelectric performance, it is also companied with the complexation of defects induced in the materials. 0D point defects, 1D linear defects, 2D planar defects, and 3D bulk defects have all been induced in thermoelectric materials for the optimization of thermoelectric performance. Considering the distinct characteristics of each type of defects, in-depth understanding of their roles in the thermoelectric transport process is of vital importance. In this paper, we classify and summarize the defect-related physical effects on both band structure and transport behavior of carriers and phonons when inducing different types of defects. Recent achievements in experimental characterization and theoretical simulation of defects are also summarized for accurately determining the type of defects serving for the design of thermoelectric materials. Finally, based on the current theoretical and experimental achievements, strategies engaged with multiple dimensional defects are reviewed for thermoelectric performance optimization.},

	abstract = {Silicon Germanium thin films are the most stable thermoelectric materials at high temperatures. Nonetheless, low efficiency and limited knowledge of such structures are still a challenge to research. Understanding the various mechanisms taking place in the matter and their relationships is the next step to boost research and to enhance the TE efficiencies, widening the range of applications. In this thesis, we develop a mathematical approach based on solid state theory to calculate the figure of merit from an electronic band structure. Added to DFT, this near ab initio method rapidly assesses virtual structures as possible TE materials. In this report, the method is applied to bulk silicon germanium with good agreement with experimental results. Throughout the development of this method, we also conclude that TE semiconductors band-gaps are related to the range of temperature where the material show higher values of ZT. We also show that doping with donors and acceptors, which is a common enhancement, need optimization for high temperatures applications due to its contribution to the thermal conductivity. Moreover the carriers' mobility is a prevalent parameter but its calculation remains complex. So, we implement deformation potential theory with DFT to calculate the electron-phonon interactions in silicon germanium alloys. We find no change of interactions with the alloy composition. With enough computing power, these methods are applicable to low dimensions structures. In addition to our theoretical study, we report a sputter deposition method of silicon germanium alloy thin films with controlled composition and thickness, grown on a sputtered layer of silicon dioxide. XRD study shows the appearance of a crystal phase beginning at deposition temperatures of 650 C . Reflectivity and TEM provide a consistent measurement of deposition thickness in the range of 20 to 100 nm with average interfaces roughness around 2 nm.},

	abstract = {We give a review of the theoretical approaches for predicting spectral phonon mean free path and thermal conductivity of solids. The methods can be summarized into two categories: anharmonic lattice dynamics calculation and molecular dynamics simulation. In the anharmonic lattice dynamics calculation, the anharmonic force constants are used first to calculate the phonon scattering rates, and then the Boltzmann transport equations are solved using either standard single mode relaxation time approximation or the Iterative Scheme method for the thermal conductivity. The MD method involves the time domain or frequency domain normal mode analysis. We present the theoretical frameworks of the methods for the prediction of phonon dispersion, spectral phonon relaxation time, and thermal conductivity of pure bulk materials, layer and tube structures, nanowires, defective materials, and superlattices. Several examples of their applications in thermal management and thermoelectric materials are given. The strength and limitations of these methods are compared in several different aspects. For more efficient and accurate predictions, the improvements of those methods are still needed.},

This book describes the theoretical background to several variants of these Monte Carlo methods and gives a systematic presentation from which newcomers can learn to perform such simulations and to analyze their results. The fifth edition covers Classical as well as Quantum Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore a new chapter on the sampling of free-energy landscapes has been added. To help students in their work a special web server has been installed to host programs and discussion groups (http://wwwcp.tphys.uni-heidelberg.de). Prof. Binder was awarded the Berni J.

            This work demonstrates dislocation dynamics in body-centered-cubic (BCC) high-entropy alloys (HEAs). The local composition inhomogeneity in these concentrated solutions leads to an unconventional rate-controlling mechanism that governs dislocation mobility. The activated process becomes nanoscale detrapping, of kinks on screw dislocations and of trapped segments of edge dislocations, presenting an activation barrier of similar magnitude for both dislocation types. Their sluggish mobility explains the elevated strength and strain hardening in BCC HEAs.
          , 
            Atomistic simulations of dislocation mobility reveal that body-centered cubic (BCC) high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are distinctly different from traditional BCC metals. HEAs are concentrated solutions in which composition fluctuation is almost inevitable. The resultant inhomogeneities, while locally promoting kink nucleation on screw dislocations, trap them against propagation with an appreciable energy barrier, replacing kink nucleation as the rate-limiting mechanism. Edge dislocations encounter a similar activated process of nanoscale segment detrapping, with comparable activation barrier. As a result, the mobility of edge dislocations, and hence their contribution to strength, becomes comparable to screw dislocations.},

The film porosity and morphology strongly affect nanoporous films mechanical properties, the knowledge of which is fundamental for designing films for specific applications. To unveil the relationships among the morphology, structure and mechanical response, a comprehensive and non-destructive investigation of a model system was sought. In this review, we examined the paradigmatic case of a nanoporous, granular, metallic ultrathin film with comprehensive bottom-up and top-down approaches, both experimentals and theoreticals. The granular film was made of Ag nanoparticles deposited by gas-phase synthesis, thus providing a solvent-free and ultrapure nanoporous system at room temperature. The results, bearing generality beyond the specific model system, are discussed for several applications specific to the morphological and mechanical properties of the investigated films, including bendable electronics, membrane separation and nanofluidic sensing.},

Nanoribbons with a fixed thickness but increased width-to-thickness ratios (9 : 1) were also studied to show that an increase in the surface energy due to the crystal re-orientation suppresses the deformation twinning. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the transition from partial dislocation mediated plasticity to perfect dislocation plasticity with increase in the width-to-thickness ratio is due to the effect of the surface energy.},

	abstract = {The surface energy, particularly for nanoparticles, is one of the most important quantities in understanding the thermodynamics of particles. Therefore, it is astonishing that there is still great uncertainty about its value. The uncertainty increases if one questions its dependence on particle size. Different approaches, such as classical thermodynamics calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and ab initio calculations, exist to predict this quantity. Generally, considerations based on classical thermodynamics lead to the prediction of decreasing values of the surface energy with decreasing particle size. This phenomenon is caused by the reduced number of next neighbors of surface atoms with decreasing particle size, a phenomenon that is partly compensated by the reduction of the binding energy between the atoms with decreasing particle size. Furthermore, this compensating effect may be expected by the formation of a disordered or quasi-liquid layer at the surface. The atomistic approach, based either on molecular dynamics simulations or ab initio calculations, generally leads to values with an opposite tendency. However, it is shown that this result is based on an insufficient definition of the particle size. A more realistic definition of the particle size is possible only by a detailed analysis of the electronic structure obtained from initio calculations. Except for minor variations caused by changes in the structure, only a minor dependence of the surface energy on the particle size is found. The main conclusion of this work is that surface energy values for the equivalent bulk materials should be used if detailed data for nanoparticles are not available.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Nanoporous metals are prototypical bicontinuous structures that have a large surface area and many applications. We demonstrate that an in-grain orientation spread develops during coarsening in nanoporous metals, leading to the formation of a nanocrystalline–nanoporous structure. The process of particles detaching and reattaching as the structure coarsens is identified as a mechanism of grain boundary formation. Coarsening the structure results in significant particle detachment with detachment rates that vary drastically with changes in the volume fraction and volume fraction inhomogeneities in the nanostructure. These results demonstrate that particle detachment must be understood to have full control of the nanocrystalline–nanoporous structure and improve material properties.
          , 
            
              Grain boundary formation during coarsening of nanoporous gold (NPG) is investigated wherein a nanocrystalline structure can form by particles detaching and reattaching to the structure. MicroLaue and electron backscatter diffraction measurements demonstrate that an in-grain orientation spread develops as NPG is coarsened. The volume fraction of the NPG sample is near the limit of bicontinuity, at which simulations predict that a bicontinuous structure begins to fragment into independent particles during coarsening. Phase-field simulations of coarsening using a computationally generated structure with a volume fraction near the limit of bicontinuity are used to model particle detachment rates. This model is tested by using the measured NPG structure as an initial condition in the phase-field simulations. We predict that up to

              sample is annealed at 300 °C for 420 min. The quantity of volume detached is found to be highly dependent on the volume fraction and volume fraction homogeneity of the nanostructure. As the void phase in the experiments cannot support independent particles, they must fall and reattach to the structure, a process that results in the formation of new grain boundaries. This particle reattachment process, along with other classic processes, leads to the formation of grain boundaries during coarsening in nanoporous metals. The formation of grain boundaries can impact a variety of applications, including mechanical strengthening; thus, the consideration and understanding of particle detachment phenomena are essential when studying nanoporous metals.},

	abstract = {Plastic deformation in crystalline materials occurs through dislocation slip and strengthening is achieved with obstacles that hinder the motion of dislocations. At relatively low temperatures, dislocations bypass the particles by Orowan looping, particle shearing, cross-slip or a combination of these mechanisms. At elevated temperatures, atomic diffusivity becomes appreciable, so that dislocations can bypass the particles by climb processes. Climb plays a crucial role in the long-term durability or creep resistance of many structural materials, particularly under extreme conditions of load, temperature and radiation. Here we systematically examine dislocation-particle interaction mechanisms. The analysis is based on three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations incorporating impenetrable particles, elastic interactions, dislocation self-climb, cross-slip and glide. The core diffusion dominated dislocation self-climb process is modelled based on a variational principle for the evolution of microstructures, and is coupled with dislocation glide and cross-slip by an adaptive time-stepping scheme to bridge the time scale separation. The stress field caused by particles is implemented based on the particle–matrix mismatch. This model is helpful for understanding the fundamental particle bypass mechanisms and clarifying the effects of dislocation glide, climb and cross-slip on creep deformation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            We revisit the meaning of stacking fault energy (SFE) and the assumptions of equilibrium dissociation of lattice dislocations in concentrated alloys. SFE is a unique value in pure metals. However, in alloys beyond the dilute limit, SFE has a distribution of values depending on the local atomic environment. Conventionally, the equilibrium distance between partial dislocations is determined by a balance between the repulsive elastic interaction between the partial dislocations and a unique value for SFE. This assumption is used to determine SFE from experimental measurements of dislocation splitting distances in metals and alloys, often contradicting computational predictions. We use atomistic simulations in a model NiCo alloy to study the dislocation dissociation process in a range of compositions with positive, zero, and negative average SFE and surprisingly observe a stable, finite splitting distance in all cases at low temperatures. We then compute the decorrelation stress and examine the balance of forces on the partial dislocations, considering the local effects on SFE, and observe that even the upper bound of SFE distribution alone cannot satisfy the force balance in some cases. Furthermore, we show that in concentrated solid solutions, the resisting force caused by interaction of dislocations with the local solute environment becomes a major force acting on partial dislocations. Here, we show that the presence of a high solute/dislocation interaction, which is not easy to measure and neglected in experimental measurements of SFE, renders the experimental values of SFE unreliable.},

              CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) was synthesized successfully from elemental powders by mechanical alloying (MA) and subsequent consolidation by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The alloying behavior, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the HEA were assessed using X-ray diffraction, electron microscope, hardness, and compression tests. MA of the elemental powders for 8 h has resulted in a two-phased microstructure:
              α-fcc
              and
              β-bcc
              phases. On the other hand, the consolidated bulk Al

In this work, the molecular dynamics method is used to calculate the tensile properties of face-centered cubic Al0.1CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys containing Σ3 grain boundaries and without grain boundary. The atomic model was established by the melting rapid cooling method, then stretched by the static drawing method. The common neighbor analysis and dislocation extraction algorithm are used to analyze the crystal evolution mechanism of Σ3 grain boundaries to improve the material properties of high-entropy alloys during the tensile test. The results show that compared with the mechanical properties Al0.1CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys without grain boundary, the yield strength and Young’s modulus of a high-entropy alloy containing Σ3 grain boundary are obviously larger than that of high-entropy alloys without grain boundary.

              High entropy alloys (HEAs), composed of multiple components with equal or near atomic proportions, have extraordinary mechanical properties and are expected to bear the impact of high-speed forces in armor protection structure materials. In order to understand the deformation behaviour of HEAs under tensile and compressive loading, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to reveal the deformation mechanism and mechanical properties of three crystal structures: Al
              0.1
              CoCrFeNi HEAs without grain boundaries (perfect HEAs), Al
              0.1
              CoCrFeNi HEAs with grain boundaries of Σ3(111)[11̄0] (GBs HEAs) and grain boundaries of Σ3(111)[11̄0] with chemical cluster HEAs (cluster-GBs HEAs). The mechanical properties of the three models at the same strain rate were discussed. Then, the mechanical properties at different strain rates were analyzed. The movement and direction of internal dislocations during the deformation process were investigated. The simulation results show that the GBs HEAs and the cluster-GBs both play an important role in the deformation and failure of the HEAs. Under tensile loading, three behaviour stages of deformation were observed. Cluster-GBs HEAs have a larger yield strength and Young's modulus than that of GBs and perfect HEAs. The higher the strain rate is, the greater the stress reduction rate. Under compressive loading, there are only two behaviour stages of deformation. Cluster-GBs HEAs also have the largest yield strength. Under tensile and compressive deformation, Shockley partial dislocations of 1/6 {\textless}112{\textgreater} are dominant and their moving direction and effect on mechanical properties are discussed.},

            Molecular dynamics is applied to explore the deformation mechanism and crystal structure development of the AlCoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys under nanoimprinting. The influences of crystal structure, alloy composition, grain size, and twin boundary distance on the mechanical properties are carefully analyzed. The imprinting load indicates that the highest loading force is in ascending order with polycrystalline, nano-twinned (NT) polycrystalline, and monocrystalline. The change in alloy composition suggests that the imprinting force increases as the Al content in the alloy increases. The reverse Hall–Petch relation found for the polycrystalline structure, while the Hall–Petch and reverse Hall–Petch relations are discovered in the NT-polycrystalline, which is due to the interactions between the dislocations and grain/twin boundaries (GBs/TBs). The deformation behavior shows that shear strain and local stress are concentrated not only around the punch but also on GBs and adjacent to GBs. The slide and twist of the GBs play a major in controlling the deformation mechanism of polycrystalline structure. The twin boundary migrations are detected during the nanoimprinting of the NT-polycrystalline. Furthermore, the elastic recovery of material is insensitive to changes in alloy composition and grain size, and the formability of the pattern is higher with a decrease in TB distance.},

          , 
            A body-centered cubic W-based refractory high entropy alloy with outstanding radiation resistance has been developed. The alloy was grown as thin films showing a bimodal grain size distribution in the nanocrystalline and ultrafine regimes and a unique 4-nm lamella-like structure revealed by atom probe tomography (APT). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray diffraction show certain black spots appearing after thermal annealing at elevated temperatures. TEM and APT analysis correlated the black spots with second-phase particles rich in Cr and V. No sign of irradiation-created dislocation loops, even after 8 dpa, was observed. Furthermore, nanomechanical testing shows a large hardness of 14 GPa in the as-deposited samples, with near negligible irradiation hardening. Theoretical modeling combining ab initio and Monte Carlo techniques predicts the formation of Cr- and V-rich second-phase particles and points at equal mobilities of point defects as the origin of the exceptional radiation tolerance.},

Both show a similar time course, similar pH dependence with a maximum at pH 6.0, and similar sensitivity to inhibitors and to treatment of the chloroplasts with a low concentration of glutaraldehyde. Their light minus dark difference spectra are similar with maxima at about 520 nm. It is concluded that they are manifestations of the same phenomenon, and the slow absorbance increase at 518 nm is due to enhanced scattering. It is proposed that the light-induced changes in scattering at 518 nm reflect alterations in selective dispersion, due to proton uptake and conformational changes in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane.},

High-pressure treatment is an effective means to change the structures and properties of metal materials. The pressure can effectively vary the distance and interaction between molecules or atoms, so as to change the bonding mode, and form high-pressure phases. These new material states often have different structures and characteristics, compared to untreated metal materials. At present, high-pressure technology is an effective method to prepare alloys with unique properties, and there are many techniques that can achieve high pressures. The most commonly used methods include high-pressure torsion, large cavity presses and diamond-anvil-cell presses. The materials show many unique properties under high pressures which do not exist under normal conditions, providing a new approach for the in-depth study of materials. In this paper, high-pressure (HP) technologies applied to high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are reviewed, and some possible ways to develop good properties of HEAs using HP as fabrication are introduced. Moreover, the studies of HEAs under high pressures are summarized, in order to deepen the basic understanding of HEAs under high pressures, which provides the theoretical basis for the application of high-entropy alloys.},

            Accompanied by enhancements in the ability to fabricate materials for humans, alloy-based materials have advanced from binary alloy systems to complicated compositions along with affording newer applications, which can accelerate the evolution of civilization. Recently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have drawn enormous attention in diverse fields because of their distinctive concept and unique properties. The impressive mechanical properties, such as excellent strength, unforgettable corrosion resistance, and superior thermostability, are inherited and overwhelming compared with traditional alloys. Therefore, HEAs have become an emerging class of advanced materials leading to a new field. Based on the exceptional synthesis methods, HEAs surprisingly afford numerous energy and environmental properties, which have endowed HEAs with promising applications. In this paper, we review the salient features of HEAs and summarize their core effects, phase structures, unconventional synthesis methods, and novel energy and environmental applications. In addition, we also discuss the broad space waiting to be explored and overview fruitful pathways of future trends and prospects.},
