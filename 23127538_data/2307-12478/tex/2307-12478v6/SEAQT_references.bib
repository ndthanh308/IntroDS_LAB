	abstract = {Monte Carlo Simulation in Statistical Physics deals with the computer simulation of many-body systems in condensed-matter physics and related fields of physics, chemistry and beyond, to traffic flows, stock market fluctuations, etc.). Using random numbers generated by a computer, probability distributions are calculated, allowing the estimation of the thermodynamic properties of various systems. This book describes the theoretical background to several variants of these Monte Carlo methods and gives a systematic presentation from which newcomers can learn to perform such simulations and to analyze their results. The fifth edition covers Classical as well as Quantum Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore a new chapter on the sampling of free-energy landscapes has been added. To help students in their work a special web server has been installed to host programs and discussion groups (http://wwwcp.tphys.uni-heidelberg.de). Prof. Binder was awarded the Berni J.

The methods can be summarized into two categories: anharmonic lattice dynamics calculation and molecular dynamics simulation. In the anharmonic lattice dynamics calculation, the anharmonic force constants are used first to calculate the phonon scattering rates, and then the Boltzmann transport equations are solved using either standard single mode relaxation time approximation or the Iterative Scheme method for the thermal conductivity. The MD method involves the time domain or frequency domain normal mode analysis. We present the theoretical frameworks of the methods for the prediction of phonon dispersion, spectral phonon relaxation time, and thermal conductivity of pure bulk materials, layer and tube structures, nanowires, defective materials, and superlattices. Several examples of their applications in thermal management and thermoelectric materials are given. The strength and limitations of these methods are compared in several different aspects. For more efficient and accurate predictions, the improvements of those methods are still needed.},

	title = {Enhancement of the figure of merit of silicon germanium thin films for thermoelectric applications},
	abstract = {Silicon Germanium thin films are the most stable thermoelectric materials at high temperatures. Nonetheless, low efficiency and limited knowledge of such structures are still a challenge to research. Understanding the various mechanisms taking place in the matter and their relationships is the next step to boost research and to enhance the TE efficiencies, widening the range of applications. In this thesis, we develop a mathematical approach based on solid state theory to calculate the figure of merit from an electronic band structure. Added to DFT, this near ab initio method rapidly assesses virtual structures as possible TE materials. In this report, the method is applied to bulk silicon germanium with good agreement with experimental results. Throughout the development of this method, we also conclude that TE semiconductors band-gaps are related to the range of temperature where the material show higher values of ZT. We also show that doping with donors and acceptors, which is a common enhancement, need optimization for high temperatures applications due to its contribution to the thermal conductivity. Moreover the carriers' mobility is a prevalent parameter but its calculation remains complex. So, we implement deformation potential theory with DFT to calculate the electron-phonon interactions in silicon germanium alloys. We find no change of interactions with the alloy composition. With enough computing power, these methods are applicable to low dimensions structures. In addition to our theoretical study, we report a sputter deposition method of silicon germanium alloy thin films with controlled composition and thickness, grown on a sputtered layer of silicon dioxide. XRD study shows the appearance of a crystal phase beginning at deposition temperatures of 650 C . Reflectivity and TEM provide a consistent measurement of deposition thickness in the range of 20 to 100 nm with average interfaces roughness around 2 nm.},

With the growing enhancement in thermoelectric performance, it is also companied with the complexation of defects induced in the materials. 0D point defects, 1D linear defects, 2D planar defects, and 3D bulk defects have all been induced in thermoelectric materials for the optimization of thermoelectric performance. Considering the distinct characteristics of each type of defects, in-depth understanding of their roles in the thermoelectric transport process is of vital importance. In this paper, we classify and summarize the defect-related physical effects on both band structure and transport behavior of carriers and phonons when inducing different types of defects. Recent achievements in experimental characterization and theoretical simulation of defects are also summarized for accurately determining the type of defects serving for the design of thermoelectric materials. Finally, based on the current theoretical and experimental achievements, strategies engaged with multiple dimensional defects are reviewed for thermoelectric performance optimization.},

	abstract = {A first-principle plane-wave pseudopotential method based on the density function theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the effects of vacancy cluster (VC) defects on the band structure and thermoelectric properties of silicon (Si) crystals. Simulation results showed that various VC defects changed the energy band and localized electron density distribution of Si crystals and caused the band gap to decrease with increasing VC size. The results can be ascribed to the formation of a defect level produced by the dangling bonds, floating bonds, or high-strain atoms surrounding the VC defects. The appearance of imaginary frequencies in the phonon spectrum of defective Si crystals indicates that the defect-region structure is dynamically unstable and demonstrates phase changes. The phonon dispersion relation and phonon density of state were also investigated using density functional perturbation theory.

Silicon is investigated as a low-cost, Earth-abundant thermoelectric material for high-temperature applications up to 900 K. For the calculation of module design the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical as well as thermal properties of silicon in the high-temperature range are of great importance. In this study, we evaluate the thermoelectric properties of low-, medium-, and high-doped silicon from room temperature to 900 K. In so doing, the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as the resulting figure of merit ZT of silicon are determined.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Thermal conductivity in semiconductors is investigated through the phonon transport description. From the former studies based
on the gas kinetic theory to the recent ones using the Monte Carlo methods or the radiative multifux models, each technique
involves the dispersion properties of the crystal lattice. Besides, most of these studies have been done in the frame of the
relaxation time approximation of collision processes. In this study, the importance of the choice of the dispersion curves
and time relaxation parameters are pointed out. A complete description of the transverse umklapp interaction is provided without
any adjustment parameters. New insights of the energy conservation surface calculation, involved in phonon-phonon time relaxation
expression, are provided. Using simple and more complex models, we have determined the heat transport properties, in the temperature
range from 50K to 1000K in bulk silicon. We especially focused our attention on the thermal conductivity as a function of
the phonon anharmonic resistive mechanisms for two models of dispersion: “linear” and “quadratic”. We demonstrate that very
different thermal conductivity properties can be calculated according to the chosen description of lattice vibrations.},

	abstract = {In this paper, Bi2Te3 nanosheets were firstly synthesized by solvothermal method, and then Ti3C2Tx (indicating O, F, OH, etc.) was introduced into bismuth telluride nanosheets with good thermoelectric properties as the second phase by the composite method of “ultrasonic dispersion-flash freeze-drying” combined with discharge plasma sintering technique, and the Bi2Te3/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites were successfully prepared. The effects of different contents of Ti3C2 T x on the thermoelectric properties of Bi2 Te3/Ti3C2 T x nanocomposites were also investigated. The samples were characterized and performance tested using scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, thermoelectric test system, and laser thermal conductivity meter. The results show that the introduction of titanium carbide into the bismuth telluride nanomatrix increases the carrier concentration of bismuth telluride, leading to an increase in conductivity and a decrease in Seebeck coefficient, but the energy barrier scattering at the composite interface avoids a significant decrease in Seebeck coefficient; the nanocrystalline boundary between titanium carbide and bismuth telluride increases phonon scattering and interfacial thermal resistance and decreases thermal conductivity. The 1 vol\% bismuth Bi2Te3/Ti3C2Tx nanocomposites showed a 25\% increase in thermoelectric figure of merit compared to the bismuth Bi2Te3 nanomatrix. 1 vol\% Bi3Te3/Ti3C2T x nanocomposites had the highest ZT value of 0.908 at 432 K and the average ZT value of 0.87 in the range of376-511 K.},

A unique crystallographic relationship of [21̅1̅0]Bi2Te3//[21̅1̅0]Te and [0001]Bi2Te3//[0001]Te has been observed for this epitaxial growth. Such epitaxial nature between Bi2Te3 nanoplates and Te nanorods is caused by their negligible lattice mismatches in the corresponding atomic planes. The interfaces between Bi2Te3 nanoplates and Te nanorods lead to a low thermal conductivity in these heteronanojunctions, so that a promising figure of merit (ZT) value is obtained (0.73 ± 0.04 at 320 K). This study provides a new method and opportunity to engineer heteronanojunctions for high-efficiency thermoelectric devices for power generation.},

Modulations in structure and composition were observed at the boundaries between the two phases of Te and Bi2Te3. Furthermore, the samples contained regularly shaped nanometer-scale Bi2Te3 single grains. Therefore, we obtained a dramatic ZT value of 2.27 (+ 0.04, − 0.08) at 375 K from the Te–Bi2Te3 thin film.

	abstract = {The Bi2Te3, Bi1.9Lu0.1Te3 and Bi1.9Tm0.1Te3 thermoelectrics of n-type conductivity have been prepared by the microwave-solvothermal method and spark plasma sintering. These compounds behave as degenerate semiconductors from room temperature up to temperature Td ≈ 470 K. Within this temperature range the temperature behavior of the specific electrical resistivity is due to the temperature changes of electron mobility determined by acoustic and optical phonon scattering. Above Td, an onset of intrinsic conductivity takes place when electrons and holes are present. At the Lu and Tm doping, the Seebeck coefficient increases, while the specific electrical resistivity and total thermal conductivity decrease within the temperature 290–630 K range. The increase of the electrical resistivity is related to the increase of electron concentration since the Tm and Lu atoms are donor centres in the Bi2Te3 lattice. The increase of the density-of-state effective mass for conduction band can be responsible for the increase of the Seebeck coefficient. The decrease of the total thermal conductivity in doped Bi2Te3 is attributed to point defects like the antisite defects and Lu or Tm atoms substituting for the Bi sites. In addition, reducing the electron thermal conductivity due to forming a narrow impurity (Lu or Tm) band having high and sharp density-of-states near the Fermi level can effectively decrease the total thermal conductivity. The thermoelectric figure-of-merit is enhanced from ∼ 0.4 for undoped Bi2Te3 up to ∼ 0.7 for Bi1.9Tm0.1Te3 and ∼ 0.9 for Bi1.9Lu0.1Te3.},

If no dispersion is assumed, a large, nonphysical discontinuity is found in the transverse phonon relaxation time over the entire temperature range. However, this effect is masked in the final prediction of the thermal conductivity by the use of fitting parameters. As the treatment of the dispersion is refined, the magnitude of the discontinuity is reduced. At the same time, discrepancies between the high temperature predictions and experimental data become apparent, indicating that the assumed heat transfer mechanisms (i.e., the relaxation time models) are not sufficient to account for the expected thermal transport. Molecular dynamics simulations may be the most suitable tool available for addressing this issue.},

This principle is implemented via the SEAQT equation of motion. The SEAQT framework has the benefit of providing insight into structural properties under non-equilibrium conditions.

              and predict the kinetics with which defects rearrange during thermal annealing. The framework provides a non-equilibrium, ensemble-based framework with a self-consistent link between mechanics (both quantum and classical) and thermodynamics. It employs an equation of motion derived from the principle of steepest entropy ascent (maximum entropy production) to predict the time evolution of a set of occupation probabilities that define the states of a system undergoing a non-equilibrium process. The system is described by a degenerate energy landscape of eigenvalues, and the entropy is found from the occupation probabilities and the eigenlevel degeneracies. Scanning tunneling microscopy was used to identify the structure and distribution of point defects observed experimentally in a 2D PtSe
              2
              film. A catalog of observed defects includes six unique point defects (vacancies and anti-site defects on Pt and Se sublattices) and twenty combinations of multiple point defects in close proximity. The defect energies were estimated with density functional theory, while the degeneracies, or density of states, for the 2D film with all possible combinations or arrangements of cataloged defects was constructed using a non-Markovian Monte-Carlo approach (i.e. the Replica–Exchange–Wang–Landau algorithm (Vogel

To know how to reduce the C concentration in the films, a sequential analysis based on first principles calculations is performed. Thus, surface reconstruction and the adsorption of the CH4 produced by the decomposition of the Ga source, Ga(CH3)3, and its incorporation into the GaN sub-surface layers are investigated. In this sequential analysis, the dataset of the adsorption probability of CH4 on reconstructed surfaces is indispensable, as is the energy of the C impurity in the GaN sub-surface layers. The C adsorption probability is obtained based on steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT). SEAQT is a thermodynamic ensemble-based, non-phenomenological framework that can predict the behavior of non-equilibrium processes, even those far from equilibrium. This framework is suitable especially when one studies the adsorption behavior of an impurity molecule because the conventional approach, the chemical potential control method, cannot be applied to a quantitative analysis for such a system. The proposed sequential model successfully explains the influence of the growth orientation, GaN(0001) and (000−1), on the incorporation of C into the film. This model can contribute to the suppression of the C contamination in GaN MOVPE.},

            Oxygen reduction in a solid oxide fuel cell cathode involves a nonequilibrium process of coupled mass and heat diffusion and electrochemical and chemical reactions. These phenomena occur at multiple temporal and spatial scales, making the modeling, especially in the transient regime, very difficult. Nonetheless, multiscale models are needed to improve the understanding of oxygen reduction and guide cathode design. Of particular importance for long-term operation are microstructure degradation and chromium oxide poisoning both of which degrade cathode performance. Existing methods are phenomenological or empirical in nature and their application limited to the continuum realm with quantum effects not captured. In contrast, steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics can be used to model nonequilibrium processes (even those far-from equilibrium) at all scales. The nonequilibrium relaxation is characterized by entropy generation, which can unify coupled phenomena into one framework to model transient and steady behavior. The results reveal the effects on performance of the different timescales of the varied phenomena involved and their coupling. Results are included here for the effects of chromium oxide concentrations on cathode output as is a parametric study of the effects of interconnect-three-phase-boundary length, oxygen mean free path, and adsorption site effectiveness. A qualitative comparison with experimental results is made.},

	abstract = {Conventional first-principle approaches for studying nonequilibrium processes depend on the mechanics of individual particles or quantum states and as a result require many details of the mechanical features of the system to arrive at a macroscopic property. In contrast, thermodynamics, which has been successful in the stable equilibrium realm, provides an approach for determining macroscopic properties without the mechanical details. Nonetheless, this phenomenological approach is not generally applicable to a nonequilibrium process except in the near-equilibrium realm and under the local equilibrium and continuum assumptions, both of which limit its ability to describe nonequilibrium phenomena. Furthermore, predicting the thermodynamic features of a nonequilibrium process (of entropy generation) across all scales is difficult. To address these drawbacks, steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT) can be used. It provides a first-principle thermodynamic-ensemble based approach applicable to the entire nonequilibrium realm even that far-from-equilibrium and does so with a single kinematics and dynamics, which crosses all temporal and spatial scales. Based on prior developments by the authors, SEAQT is used here to study the heat and mass diffusion of indistinguishable particles. The study focuses on the thermodynamic features of far-from-equilibrium state evolution, which is separated from the specific mechanics of individual particle interactions. Results for nonequilibrium size (volume) and concentration effects on the evolutionary state trajectory are presented for the case of high temperature and low particle concentration, which, however, do not impact the generality of the theory and will in future studies be relaxed.},

The influence of the variations of Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 content on thermoelectric properties was studied. The increase of Bi2Se3 content (x) caused an increase in carrier concentration and thus an increase of σ and a decrease of α. The maximum figure of merit (ZT = α2σT/κ) of 0.87 was obtained at about 325 K for the composition of 93\%Bi2Te3-7\%Bi2Se3 with doping TeI4.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of transport coefficients in extended systems, such as thermal conductivity or shear viscosity, is known to require impractically long simulations, thus calling for a paradigm shift that would allow to deploy state-of-the-art quantum simulation methods. We introduce a new method to compute these coefficients from optimally short molecular dynamics simulations, based on the Green-Kubo theory of linear response and the cepstral analysis of time series. Information from the full sample power spectrum of the relevant current for a single and relatively short trajectory is leveraged to evaluate and optimally reduce the noise affecting its zero-frequency value, whose expectation is proportional to the corresponding conductivity. Our method is unbiased and consistent, in that both the resulting bias and statistical error can be made arbitrarily small in the long-time limit. A simple data-analysis protocol is proposed and validated with the calculation of thermal conductivities in the paradigmatic cases of elemental and molecular fluids (liquid Ar and H2O) and of crystalline and glassy solids (MgO and a-SiO2). We find that simulation times of one to a few hundred picoseconds are sufficient in these systems to achieve an accuracy of the order of 10\% on the estimated thermal conductivities.},

Its main inputs are sets of second- and third-order interatomic force constants, which can be calculated using third-party ab-initio packages. Dirac delta distributions arising from conservation of energy are approximated by Gaussian functions. A locally adaptive algorithm is used to determine each process-specific broadening parameter, which renders the method fully parameter free. The code is free software, written in Fortran and parallelized using MPI. A complementary Python script to help compute third-order interatomic force constants from a minimum number of ab-initio calculations, using a real-space finite-difference approach, is also publicly available for download. Here we discuss the design and implementation of both pieces of software and present results for three example systems: Si, InAs and lonsdaleite.

Attempts have been made to grow single crystals of the material by the Stockbarger method, by directional freezing in a horizontal boat, and by pulling from the melt. The first two methods were not found to be satisfactory because of segregation of tellurium towards the last end of the ingot to freeze. This was particularly marked at the slow speeds of withdrawal desirable for good single crystal growth. At fast speeds of withdrawal the segregation was prevented, but at these speeds large single crystals were not produced. Larger crystals, about 1 cm × 2 cm × 3 cm were produced by the pulling method, using a hydrogen atmosphere. These were all p-type of thermo-electric power 200-215μV deg-1 even when considerable departures from the stoichiometric composition Bi2Te3 were made in the charge from which the crystals were pulled. The energy gap of this material, measured optically, was 0.15 eV. A p-type single crystal specimen of thermo-electric power 200μV deg-1 had a room temperature electrical conductivity of 500 Ω-1 cm-1 parallel to the cleavage planes. The room temperature thermal conductivity of the same specimen was 0.0175 W cm-1 deg-1 parallel to the cleavage planes, and 0.0076 W cm-1 deg-1 perpendicular to the cleavage planes.},

Perturbo uses results from density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory calculations as input, and employs Wannier interpolation to reduce the computational cost. It supports norm-conserving and ultrasoft pseudopotentials, spin–orbit coupling, and polar electron–phonon interactions for bulk and 2D materials. Hybrid MPI plus OpenMP parallelization is implemented to enable efficient calculations on large systems (up to at least 50 atoms) using high-performance computing.

No ad hoc parameter is required throughout this calculation, and GaAs, a well-studied polar material, is used as an example to demonstrate this method. In this work, the long-range and short-range contributions as well as the intravalley and intervalley transitions in the e-ph interactions (EPIs) have been quantitatively addressed. Promoted by such mode-by-mode analysis, we find that in GaAs, the piezoelectric scattering is comparable to deformation-potential scattering for electron scatterings by acoustic phonons in EPI even at room temperature, and it makes a significant contribution to mobility. Furthermore, we achieved good agreement with experimental data for the mobility, and we identified that electrons with mean free paths between 130 and 210 nm provide the dominant contribution to the electron transport at 300 K. Such information provides a deeper understanding of the electron transport in GaAs, and the presented framework can be readily applied to other polar materials.},

Drag also strongly boosts the intrinsic electron mobility, thermal conductivity and the Lorenz number. Impurity scattering is seen to suppress the drag enhancement of the thermal and electrical conductivities, while having weak effects on the enhancement of the Lorenz number and thermopower.

The energy eigenstructure is generated using a non-Markovian Monte Carlo model that estimates energy level degeneracies. The equation of motion is used to determine the occupation probability of each energy level, describing the unique path through thermodynamic state space by which the polymer system sequesters rare-earth ions from solution. A second Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to relate the kinetic path in state space to physical descriptors associated with the polymer, including the radius of gyration, tortuosity, and Eu-neighbor distribution functions. These descriptors are used to visualize the evolution of the polymer during the sequestration process. The fraction of sequestered Eu3+ ions depends upon the total energy of the system, with lower energy resulting in greater sequestration.

The landscape is generated using the Replica Exchange Wang–Landau method applied to a polymer chain represented by a sequence of hydrophobic and polar monomers with a simple hydrophobic-polar amino acid model. The chain conformation evolves as energy shifts among the levels of the energy landscape according to the principle of steepest entropy ascent. This principle is implemented via the SEAQT equation of motion. The SEAQT framework has the benefit of providing insight into structural properties under non-equilibrium conditions. Chain conformations during heating and cooling change continuously without sharp transitions in morphology. The changes are more drastic along non-equilibrium paths than along quasi-equilibrium paths.

The framework provides a non-equilibrium, ensemble-based framework with a self-consistent link between mechanics (both quantum and classical) and thermodynamics. It employs an equation of motion derived from the principle of steepest entropy ascent (maximum entropy production) to predict the time evolution of a set of occupation probabilities that define the states of a system undergoing a non-equilibrium process. The system is described by a degenerate energy landscape of eigenvalues, and the entropy is found from the occupation probabilities and the eigenlevel degeneracies. Scanning tunneling microscopy was used to identify the structure and distribution of point defects observed experimentally in a 2D PtSe2 film. A catalog of observed defects includes six unique point defects (vacancies and anti-site defects on Pt and Se sublattices) and twenty combinations of multiple point defects in close proximity. The defect energies were estimated with density functional theory, while the degeneracies, or density of states, for the 2D film with all possible combinations or arrangements of cataloged defects was constructed using a non-Markovian Monte-Carlo approach (i.e. the Replica–Exchange–Wang–Landau algorithm (Vogel et al 2013 Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 210603)) with a q-state Potts model. The energy landscape and associated degeneracies were determined for a 2D PtSe2 film two molecules thick and unit cells in area (total of 5400 atoms). The SEAQT equation of motion was applied to the energy landscape to determine how an arbitrary density and arrangement of the six defect types evolve during annealing. Two annealing processes were modeled: heating from 77 K (−196 C) to 523 K (250 ∘C) and isothermal annealing at 523 K. The SEAQT framework predicted defect configurations, which were consistent with experimental STM images.},

The energy landscape is used by an equation of motion from the steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic (SEAQT) framework to explore the kinetics of three distinct kinds of microstructural evolution: polycrystalline sintering, precipitate coarsening, and grain growth. The steepest-entropy-ascent postulate predicts unique kinetic paths for these non-equilibrium processes without needing any detailed information about the underlying physical mechanisms of the processes. A method is also proposed for associating the kinetic path in state space to a set of smoothly evolving microstructural descriptors. The SEAQT-predicted kinetics agree well with available experimental kinetics for ZrO2 sintering, Al3Li precipitate coarsening, and grain growth in nanocrystalline Pd. The computational cost associated with calculating the energy landscape needed by the approach is comparable to a Monte Carlo simulation. However, the subsequent kinetic calculations from the SEAQT equation of motion are quite modest and save considerable computational resources by obviating the need for averaging multiple kinetic Monte Carlo runs.},

Strategies with these pulsed electric fields (PEFs) have been developed for clinical applications in cancer therapeutics, in-vivo decellularization, and tissue regeneration. Successful implementation of these strategies involve understanding how PEFs impact the cellular structures and, hence, cell behavior. The caveat, however, is that the PEF parameter space (i.e., comprising different pulse widths, amplitudes, number of pulses) is large, and design of experiments to explore all possible combinations of pulse parameters is prohibitive from a cost and time standpoint. In this study, a scaling law based on the Ising model is introduced to understand the impact of PEFs on the outer cell lipid membrane so that an understanding developed in one PEF pulse regime may be extended to another. Combining non-Markovian Monte Carlo techniques to determine density-of-states with a novel non-equilibrium thermodynamic framework based on the principle of steepest entropy ascent, the applicability of this scaling model to predict the behavior of both thermally quenched and electrically perturbed lipid membranes is demonstrated. A comparison of the predictions made by the steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic (SEAQT) framework to experimental data is performed to validate the robustness of this computational methodology and the resulting scaling law.},

This framework assumes that a thermodynamic property in an isolated system traces the path through state space with the greatest entropy production. Magnetization is calculated from the expected value of a thermodynamic ensemble of quantized spin waves based on the Heisenberg spin model applied to an ensemble of coupled harmonic oscillators. A realistic energy landscape is obtained from a magnon dispersion relation calculated using spin-density-functional-theory. The equilibrium magnetization as well as the evolution of magnetization from a non-equilibrium state to equilibrium are calculated from the path of steepest entropy ascent determined from the SEAQT equation of motion in state space. The framework makes it possible to model the temperature and time-dependence of magnetization without a detailed description of magnetic damping. The approach is also used to define intensive properties (temperature and magnetic field strength) that are fundamentally, i.e. canonically or grand canonically, valid for any non-equilibrium state. Given the assumed magnon dispersion relation, the SEAQT framework is used to calculate the equilibrium magnetization at different temperatures and external magnetic fields and the results are shown to closely agree with experiment for temperatures less than 500 K. The time-dependent evolution of magnetization from different initial states and interactions with a reservoir is also predicted.},

In this contribution, the SEAQT modeling is extended to the solid phase by constructing a so-called pseudo-eigenstructure, and its applicability is demonstrated by calculating the thermal expansion of metallic silver for three cases: (a) stable equilibrium, (b) along three irreversible paths from different initial non-equilibrium states to stable equilibrium, and (c) along an irreversible path between two stable equilibrium states. The SEAQT framework with an anharmonic pseudo-eigenstructure predicts reasonable values for the equilibrium thermal expansion.

These phenomena occur at multiple temporal and spatial scales, making the modeling, especially in the transient regime, very difficult. Nonetheless, multiscale models are needed to improve the understanding of oxygen reduction and guide cathode design. Of particular importance for long-term operation are microstructure degradation and chromium oxide poisoning both of which degrade cathode performance. Existing methods are phenomenological or empirical in nature and their application limited to the continuum realm with quantum effects not captured. In contrast, steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics can be used to model nonequilibrium processes (even those far-from equilibrium) at all scales. The nonequilibrium relaxation is characterized by entropy generation, which can unify coupled phenomena into one framework to model transient and steady behavior. The results reveal the effects on performance of the different timescales of the varied phenomena involved and their coupling. Results are included here for the effects of chromium oxide concentrations on cathode output as is a parametric study of the effects of interconnect-three-phase-boundary length, oxygen mean free path, and adsorption site effectiveness.

In this study, ammonia chemical adsorption on GaN(0001) reconstructed surfaces under metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) conditions (3Ga-H and Nad-H + Ga-H on a 2 × 2 unit cell) is investigated using steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT). SEAQT is a thermodynamic-ensemble based, first-principles framework that can predict the behavior of non-equilibrium processes, even those far from equilibrium where the state evolution is a combination of reversible and irreversible dynamics. SEAQT is an ideal choice to handle this problem on a first-principles basis since the chemical adsorption process starts from a highly non-equilibrium state. A result of the analysis shows that the probability of adsorption on 3Ga-H is significantly higher than that on Nad-H + Ga-H. Additionally, the growth temperature dependence of these adsorption probabilities and the temperature increase due to the heat of reaction is determined. The non-equilibrium thermodynamic modeling applied can lead to better control of the MOVPE process through the selection of preferable reconstructed surfaces. The modeling also demonstrates the efficacy of DFT-SEAQT coupling for determining detailed non-equilibrium process characteristics with a much smaller computational burden than would be entailed with mechanics-based, microscopic-mesoscopic approaches.},

	abstract = {Conventional first-principle approaches for studying nonequilibrium processes depend on the mechanics of individual particles or quantum states and as a result require many details of the mechanical features of the system to arrive at a macroscopic property. In contrast, thermodynamics, which has been successful in the stable equilibrium realm, provides an approach for determining macroscopic properties without the mechanical details. Nonetheless, this phenomenological approach is not generally applicable to a nonequilibrium process except in the near-equilibrium realm and under the local equilibrium and continuum assumptions, both of which limit its ability to describe nonequilibrium phenomena. Furthermore, predicting the thermodynamic features of a nonequilibrium process (of entropy generation) across all scales is difficult. To address these drawbacks, steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEAQT) can be used. It provides a first-principle thermodynamic-ensemble based approach applicable to the entire nonequilibrium realm even that far-from-equilibrium and does so with a single kinematics and dynamics, which crosses all temporal and spatial scales. Based on prior developments by the authors, SEAQT is used here to study the heat and mass diffusion of indistinguishable particles. The study focuses on the thermodynamic features of far-from-equilibrium state evolution, which is separated from the specific mechanics of individual particle interactions. Results for nonequilibrium size (volume) and concentration effects on the evolutionary state trajectory are presented for the case of high temperature and low particle concentration, which, however, do not impact the generality of the theory and will in future studies be relaxed.},

	abstract = {When thermodynamics is understood as the science (or art) of constructing effective models of natural phenomena by choosing a minimal level of description capable of capturing the essential features of the physical reality of interest, the scientific community has identified a set of general rules that the model must incorporate if it aspires to be consistent with the body of known experimental evidence. Some of these rules are believed to be so general that we think of them as laws of Nature, such as the great conservation principles, whose ‘greatness’ derives from their generality, as masterfully explained by Feynman in one of his legendary lectures. The second law of thermodynamics is universally contemplated among the great laws of Nature. In this paper, we show that in the past four decades, an enormous body of scientific research devoted to modelling the essential features of non-equilibrium natural phenomena has converged from many different directions and frameworks towards the general recognition (albeit still expressed in different but equivalent forms and language) that another rule is also indispensable and reveals another great law of Nature that we propose to call the ‘fourth law of thermodynamics’. We state it as follows: every non-equilibrium state of a system or local subsystem for which entropy is well defined must be equipped with a metric in state space with respect to which the irreversible component of its time evolution is in the direction of steepest entropy ascent compatible with the conservation constraints. To illustrate the power of the fourth law, we derive (nonlinear) extensions of Onsager reciprocity and fluctuation–dissipation relations to the far-non-equilibrium realm within the framework of the rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium approximation (also known as the quasi-equilibrium approximation).

First, a brief derivation is presented showing that Bell diagonal states are stationary states that are not stable equilibrium states relative to the SEAQT equation of motion, highlighting the need for the development of perturbation methods to study the evolutions of nearby states. This contrasts with the Lindblad equation of motion for which only some of the Bell diagonal states are stationary. Next, two perturbation methods are presented. The first is a general method for perturbing bipartite systems and the second is a method based on a set of unitary operations that are constrained to hold the system energy and system entropy constant. Sets of density operators are randomly generated with each method and the resulting time-varying characteristics of the system's entanglement are analyzed. The findings reveal that the evolutions associated with the constrained perturbations accurately predict the loss of non-locality and align well with the measured concurrence.},
