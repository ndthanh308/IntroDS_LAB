  "abstract": "Accurately localizing and identifying vertebrae from CT images is crucial for various clinical applications. However, most existing efforts are performed on 3D with cropping patch operation, suffering from the large computation costs and limited global information. In this paper, we propose a multi-view vertebra localization and identification from CT images, converting the 3D problem into a 2D localization and identification task on different views. Without the limitation of the 3D cropped patch, our method can learn the multi-view global information naturally. Moreover, to better capture the anatomical structure information from different view perspectives, a multi-view contrastive learning strategy is developed to pre-train the backbone. Additionally, we further propose a Sequence Loss to maintain the sequential structure embedded along the vertebrae. Evaluation results demonstrate that, with only two 2D networks, our method can localize and identify vertebrae in CT images accurately, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods consistently.
