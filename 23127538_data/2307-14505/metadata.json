  "abstract": "Memcomputing logic gates generalize the traditional Boolean logic gates for operation in the reverse direction. According to the literature, this functionality enables the efficient solution of computationally-intensive problems including factorization and NP-complete problems. To approach the deployment of memcomputing gates in hardware, this paper introduces SPICE models of memcomputing logic gates following their original definition. Using these models, we demonstrate the behavior of single gates as well as small self-organizing circuits. We also correct some inconsistencies in the prior literature. Importantly, the correct schematics of dynamic correction module is reported here for the first time. Our work makes memcomputing more accessible to those who are interested in this emerging computing technology.",
