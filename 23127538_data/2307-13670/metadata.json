  "abstract": "This is the second article in a series devoted to the study of the asymptotic expansions of various quantum invariants related to the twist knots. In this article, following the method and results in \\cite{CZ23-1}, we present an asymptotic expansion formula for the colored Jones polynomial of twist knot $\\mathcal{K}_p$ with $p\\geq 6$ at the root of unity $e^{\\frac{2π\\sqrt{-1}}{N+\\frac{1}{M}}}$ with $M\\geq 2$. Furthermore, by taking the limit $M\\rightarrow +\\infty$, we obtain an asymptotic expansion formula for the colored Jones polynomial of twist knots $\\mathcal{K}_p$ with $p\\geq 6$ at the root of unity $e^{\\frac{2π\\sqrt{-1}}{N}}$.",
