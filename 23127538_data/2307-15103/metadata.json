  "abstract": "This study uses an associated Riccati equation to study the Ulam stability of non-autonomous linear differential vector equations that model the damped linear oscillator. In particular, the best (minimal) Ulam constants for these non-autonomous linear differential vector equations are derived. These robust results apply to vector equations with solutions that blow up in finite time, as well as to vector equations with solutions that exist globally on $(-\\infty,\\infty)$. Illustrative, non-trivial examples are presented, highlighting the main results.",
