  "abstract": "This paper focuses on the problem of finding a continuous extension of the hypercomplex logarithm along a path. While a branch of the complex logarithm can be defined in a small open neighbourhood of a strictly negative real point, no continuous branch of the hypercomplex logarithm can be defined in any open set $A\\subset \\mathbb K\\setminus \\{0\\}$ which contains a strictly negative real point $x_0$ (here $\\mathbb K$ represents the algebra of quaternions or octonions).\n  To overcome these difficulties, we introduced the logarithmic manifold $\\mathscr E_\\mathbb K^+$ and then showed that if $q\\in\\mathbb K,\\ q=x+Iy$ then $E(x+Iy) %= (\\exp (x + Iy), Iy) = (\\exp x \\cos y + I\\exp x \\sin y, Iy)$ is an immersion and a diffeomorphism between $\\mathbb K$ and $\\mathscr E_\\mathbb K^+$.\n  In this paper, we consider lifts of paths in $\\mathbb K\\setminus\\{0\\}$ to the logarithmic manifold $\\mathscr{E}^+_\\mathbb K$; even though $\\mathbb K \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is simply connected, in general, given a path in $\\mathbb K \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the existence of a lift of this path to $\\mathscr{E}^+_\\mathbb K$ is not guaranteed. There is an obvious equivalence between the problem of lifting a path in $\\mathbb K \\setminus \\{0\\}$ and the one of finding a continuation of the hypercomplex logarithm $\\log_{\\mathbb K}$ along this path.",
