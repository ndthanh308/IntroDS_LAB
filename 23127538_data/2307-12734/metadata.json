  "abstract": "We study the holomorphic motions of repelling periodic points in stable families of endomorphisms of $\\mathbb P^k (\\mathbb C)$. In particular, we establish an asymptotic equidistribution of the graphs associated to such periodic points with respect to natural measures in the space of all holomorphic motions of points in the Julia sets.",
