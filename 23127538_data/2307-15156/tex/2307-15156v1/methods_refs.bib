In particular, the neutrinoless mode is discussed in detail, since it is sensitive to lepton number violation as predicted by gauge theories beyond the standard model and it is expected to give important information on the nature of the neutrinos and the weak interaction. Various approximations made in the theoretical treatment of neutrinoless and two-neutrino double beta decay are examined, and the limits on the effective Majorana mass of the electron neutrino as well as the coupling constants of the right-handed leptonic current are presented.},

abstract = "We present a comprehensive review of the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IM-SRG), a novel ab initio method for nuclei. The IM-SRG employs a continuous unitary transformation of the many-body Hamiltonian to decouple the ground state from all excitations, thereby solving the many-body problem. Starting from a pedagogical introduction of the underlying concepts, the IM-SRG flow equations are developed for systems with and without explicit spherical symmetry. We study different IM-SRG generators that achieve the desired decoupling, and how they affect the details of the IM-SRG flow. Based on calculations of closed-shell nuclei, we assess possible truncations for closing the system of flow equations in practical applications, as well as choices of the reference state. We discuss the issue of center-of-mass factorization and demonstrate that the IM-SRG ground-state wave function exhibits an approximate decoupling of intrinsic and center-of-mass degrees of freedom, similar to Coupled Cluster (CC) wave functions. To put the IM-SRG in context with other many-body methods, in particular many-body perturbation theory and non-perturbative approaches like CC, a detailed perturbative analysis of the IM-SRG flow equations is carried out. We conclude with a discussion of ongoing developments, including IM-SRG calculations with three-nucleon forces, the multi-reference IM-SRG for open-shell nuclei, first non-perturbative derivations of shell-model interactions, and the consistent evolution of operators in the IM-SRG. We dedicate this review to the memory of Gerry Brown, one of the pioneers of many-body calculations of nuclei.",

abstract = {We present ab initio predictions for ground and excited states of doubly open-shell fluorine and neon isotopes based on chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions. We use the in-medium similarity renormalization group, in both flow-equation and Magnus formulations, to derive mass-dependent sd valence-space Hamiltonians. The experimental ground-state energies are reproduced through neutron number N=14, beyond which a new targeted normal-ordering procedure improves agreement with data and large-scale multi-reference calculations. For spectroscopy, we focus on neutron-rich 23-26F and 24-26Ne isotopes near N=14,16 magic numbers. In all cases we find an agreement with experiment competitive with established phenomenology. Moreover, yrast states are well described in 20Ne and 24Mg, providing an ab initio description of deformation in the medium-mass region.},
