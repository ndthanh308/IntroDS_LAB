@article{Cirigliano2022,
abstract = {The observation of neutrino oscillations and hence non-zero neutrino masses
provided a milestone in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model. But
even though we now know that neutrinos are massive, the nature of neutrino
masses, i.e., whether they are Dirac or Majorana, remains an open question. A
smoking-gun signature of Majorana neutrinos is the observation of neutrinoless
double-beta decay, a process that violates the lepton-number conservation of
the Standard Model. This white paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of the
neutrinoless double-beta decay program and lays out a roadmap for future
developments. The roadmap is a multi-scale path starting from high-energy
models of neutrinoless double-beta decay all the way to the low-energy nuclear
many-body problem that needs to be solved to supplement measurements of the
decay rate. The path goes through a systematic effective-field-theory
description of the underlying processes at various scales and needs to be
supplemented by lattice quantum chromodynamics input. The white paper also
discusses the interplay between neutrinoless double-beta decay, experiments at
the Large Hadron Collider and results from astrophysics and cosmology in
probing simplified models of lepton-number violation at the TeV scale, and the
generation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry via leptogenesis. This white
paper is prepared for the topical groups TF11 (Theory of Neutrino Physics),

@article{Adams2022,
abstract = {The possibility that neutrinos may be their own antiparticles, unique among the known fundamental particles, arises from the symmetric theory of fermions proposed by Ettore Majorana in 19371. Given the profound consequences of such Majorana neutrinos, among which is a potential explanation for the matter–antimatter asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis2, the Majorana nature of neutrinos commands intense experimental scrutiny globally; one of the primary experimental probes is neutrinoless double beta (0$\nu$$\beta$$\beta$) decay. Here we show results from the search for 0$\nu$$\beta$$\beta$ decay of 130Te, using the latest advanced cryogenic calorimeters with the CUORE experiment3. CUORE, operating just 10 millikelvin above absolute zero, has pushed the state of the art on three frontiers: the sheer mass held at such ultralow temperatures, operational longevity, and the low levels of ionizing radiation emanating from the cryogenic infrastructure. We find no evidence for 0$\nu$$\beta$$\beta$ decay and set a lower bound of the process half-life as 2.2 × 1025 years at a 90 per cent credibility interval. We discuss potential applications of the advances made with CUORE to other fields such as direct dark matter, neutrino and nuclear physics searches and large-scale quantum computing, which can benefit from sustained operation of large payloads in a low-radioactivity, ultralow-temperature cryogenic environment.},

@article{Cirigliano2021,
abstract = {We present a method to determine the leading-order (LO) contact term contributing to the nn → ppe−e− amplitude through the exchange of light Majorana neutrinos. Our approach is based on the representation of the amplitude as the momentum integral of a known kernel (proportional to the neutrino propagator) times the generalized forward Compton scattering amplitude n(p1)n(p2)W+(k) → $$ p\left({p}_1^{\prime}\right)p\left({p}_2^{\prime}\right){W}^{-}(k) $$, in analogy to the Cottingham formula for the electromagnetic contribution to hadron masses. We construct model-independent representations of the integrand in the low- and high-momentum regions, through chiral EFT and the operator product expansion, respectively. We then construct a model for the full amplitude by interpolating between these two regions, using appropriate nucleon factors for the weak currents and information on nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering in the 1S0 channel away from threshold. By matching the amplitude obtained in this way to the LO chiral EFT amplitude we obtain the relevant LO contact term and discuss various sources of uncertainty. We validate the approach by computing the analog I = 2 NN contact term and by reproducing, within uncertainties, the charge-independence-breaking contribution to the 1S0 NN scattering lengths. While our analysis is performed in the $$ \overline{\mathrm{MS}} $$scheme, we express our final result in terms of the scheme-independent renormalized amplitude $$ {\mathcal{A}}_{\nu}\left(\left|\mathbf{p}\right|,\left|\mathbf{p}^{\prime}\right|\right) $$at a set of kinematic points near threshold. We illustrate for two cutoff schemes how, using our synthetic data for $$ {\mathcal{A}}_{\nu } $$, one can determine the contact-term contribution in any regularization scheme, in particular the ones employed in nuclear-structure calculations for isotopes of experimental interest.},

We study the relative value of the different contributions to the NME's, such as higher order terms in the nuclear current, finite nuclear size effects and short range correlations, as well as their evolution with the maximum seniority permitted in the wave functions. We discuss also the build-up of the NME's as a function of the distance between the decaying neutrons. We calculate the decays to 01+ final states and find that these decays are at least 25 times more suppressed with respect to the ground state to ground state transition.},

In our calculations, performed with the nuclear shell model and proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation (pnQRPA) methods, we estimate the coupling of this term by the contact charge-independence-breaking coupling of various nuclear Hamiltonians. Our results suggest a significant impact of the short-range matrix element, which is about 15\%−50\% and 30\%−80\% of the standard 0νββ-decay long-range matrix element for the shell model and pnQRPA, respectively. Combining the full matrix elements with the results from current 0νββ-decay experiments we find that, if both matrix elements carry the same sign, these searches move notably toward probing the inverted mass ordering of neutrino masses.},

ABSTRACT={Over the last decade, new developments in Similarity Renormalization Group techniques and nuclear many-body methods have dramatically increased the capabilities of ab initio nuclear structure and reaction theory. Ground and excited-state properties can be computed up to the tin region, and from the proton to the presumptive neutron drip lines, providing unprecedented opportunities to confront two- plus three-nucleon interactions from chiral Effective Field Theory with experimental data. In this contribution, I will give a broad survey of the current status of nuclear many-body approaches, and I will use selected results to discuss both achievements and open issues that need to be addressed in the coming decade.}

We use the in-medium similarity renormalization group, in both flow-equation and Magnus formulations, to derive mass-dependent sd valence-space Hamiltonians. The experimental ground-state energies are reproduced through neutron number N=14, beyond which a new targeted normal-ordering procedure improves agreement with data and large-scale multi-reference calculations. For spectroscopy, we focus on neutron-rich 23-26F and 24-26Ne isotopes near N=14,16 magic numbers. In all cases we find an agreement with experiment competitive with established phenomenology. Moreover, yrast states are well described in 20Ne and 24Mg, providing an ab initio description of deformation in the medium-mass region.},

journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
abstract = {The nEXO neutrinoless double beta (0νββ) decay experiment is designed to use a time projection chamber and 5000 kg of isotopically enriched liquid xenon to search for the decay in 136Xe. Progress in the detector design, paired with higher fidelity in its simulation and an advanced data analysis, based on the one used for the final results of EXO-200, produce a sensitivity prediction that exceeds the half-life of 1028 years. Specifically, improvements have been made in the understanding of production of scintillation photons and charge as well as of their transport and reconstruction in the detector. The more detailed knowledge of the detector construction has been paired with more assays for trace radioactivity in different materials. In particular, the use of custom electroformed copper is now incorporated in the design, leading to a substantial reduction in backgrounds from the intrinsic radioactivity of detector materials. Furthermore, a number of assumptions from previous sensitivity projections have gained further support from interim work validating the nEXO experiment concept. Together these improvements and updates suggest that the nEXO experiment will reach a half-life sensitivity of 1.35 × 1028 yr at 90\% confidence level in 10 years of data taking, covering the parameter space associated with the inverted neutrino mass ordering, along with a significant portion of the parameter space for the normal ordering scenario, for almost all nuclear matrix elements. The effects of backgrounds deviating from the nominal values used for the projections are also illustrated, concluding that the nEXO design is robust against a number of imperfections of the model.}

In this update we include new long-baseline neutrino data involving the antineutrino channel in T2K, as well as new data in the neutrino channel, data from NOνA, as well as new reactor data, such as the Daya Bay 1230 days electron antineutrino disappearance spectrum data and the 1500 live days prompt spectrum from RENO, as well as new Double Chooz data. We also include atmospheric neutrino data from the IceCube DeepCore and ANTARES neutrino telescopes and from Super-Kamiokande. Finally, we also update our solar oscillation analysis by including the 2055-day day/night spectrum from the fourth phase of the Super-Kamiokande experiment. With the new data we find a preference for the atmospheric angle in the upper octant for both neutrino mass orderings, with maximal mixing allowed at Δχ2=1.6(3.2) for normal (inverted) ordering. We also obtain a strong preference for values of the CP phase δ in the range [π,2π], excluding values close to π/2 at more than 4σ. More remarkably, our global analysis shows a hint in favor of the normal mass ordering over the inverted one at more than 3σ. We discuss in detail the status of the mass ordering, CP violation and octant sensitivities, analyzing the interplay among the different neutrino data samples.}

abstract = {Motivated by limitations of the Bloch–Horowitz–Brandow perturbative approach to nuclear structure we have developed the non-perturbative ab initio no core shell model (NCSM) capable of solving the properties of nuclei exactly for arbitrary nucleon–nucleon (NN) and NN+ three-nucleon (NNN) interactions with exact preservation of all symmetries. We present the complete ab initio NCSM formalism and review highlights obtained with it since its inception. These highlights include the first ab initio nuclear-structure calculations utilizing chiral NNN interactions, which predict the correct low-lying spectrum for 10B and explain the anomalous long 14C β-decay lifetime. We also obtain the small quadrupole moment of 6Li. In addition to explaining long-standing nuclear structure anomalies, the ab initio NCSM provides a predictive framework for observables that are not yet measured or are not directly measurable. For example, reactions between short-lived systems and reaction rates near zero energy are relevant to fusion research but may not be known from experiment with sufficient precision. We, therefore, discuss, in detail, the extension of the ab initio NCSM to nuclear reactions and sketch a number of promising future directions for research emerging from the NCSM foundation, including a microscopic non-perturbative framework for the theory with a core. Having a parameter-free approach, we can construct systems with a core, which will provide an ab initio pathway to heavier nuclei.}

@article{Navratil2016,
abstract = {The description of nuclei starting from the constituent nucleons and the realistic interactions among them has been a long-standing goal in nuclear physics. In addition to the complex nature of the nuclear forces, with two-, three- and possibly higher many-nucleon components, one faces the quantum-mechanical many-nucleon problem governed by an interplay between bound and continuum states. In recent years, significant progress has been made in ab initio nuclear structure and reaction calculations based on input from QCD-employing Hamiltonians constructed within chiral effective field theory. After a brief overview of the field, we focus on ab initio many-body approaches - built upon the no-core shell model - that are capable of simultaneously describing both bound and scattering nuclear states, and present results for resonances in light nuclei, reactions important for astrophysics and fusion research. In particular, we review recent calculations of resonances in the 6He halo nucleus, of five- and six-nucleon scattering, and an investigation of the role of chiral three-nucleon interactions in the structure of 9Be. Further, we discuss applications to the 7Be radiative capture. Finally, we highlight our efforts to describe transfer reactions including the 3HHe fusion.},

For example, with the same chiral interactions, QMC calculations can reproduce binding energies and radii for light nuclei, n–α scattering phase shifts, and the neutron matter equation of state. This compelling new body of work has been made possible both by advances in QMC methods for nuclear physics, which push the bounds of applicability to heavier nuclei and to asymmetric nuclear matter, and by the development of local chiral EFT interactions up to next-to-next-to-leading order and minimally nonlocal interactions including Δ degrees of freedom. In this review, we discuss these recent developments and give an overview of the exciting results for nuclei, neutron matter and neutron stars, and electroweak reactions. }
