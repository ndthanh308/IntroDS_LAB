  "abstract": "We give a status report on new developments in the WHIZARD event generator, including NLO electroweak automation for $e^+e^-$ colliders, loop-induced processes, POWHEG matching, new features in the UFO interface and the current development for matching between exclusive photon radiation and fixed-order LO/NLO electroweak (EW) corrections. We report on several bug fixes relevant for certain aspects of the ILC250 Monte Carlo (MC) mass production, especially on the normalization of matching EPA samples with full-matrix element samples. Finally, we mention some ongoing work on efficiency improvements regarding parallelization of matrix elements and phase space sampling, as well as plans to revive the top threshold simulation.",
