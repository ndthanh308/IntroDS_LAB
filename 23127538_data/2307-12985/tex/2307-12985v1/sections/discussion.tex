\section{Discussion}
\label{sec_disc}

In this paper, we introduced an algorithm to split a negative binomial random variable into two or more independent negative binomial random variables, and we applied it to the analysis of scRNA-seq data. This algorithm is also applicable in other settings; data are modeled as negative binomial in a wide variety of fields. Furthermore, while we were particularly motivated by unsupervised settings in which sample splitting is not an option, negative binomial count splitting can also be used in supervised settings such as inference after variable selection in negative binomial regression. For further discussion, see \cite{neufeld2023data} and \cite{dharamshi2023generalized}. An implementation of the techniques in this paper is available in the \texttt{R} package \texttt{countsplit}, and tutorials showing how this can be integrated with existing scRNA-seq software packages, are available at \texttt{anna-neufeld.github.io/countsplit.tutorials}.
