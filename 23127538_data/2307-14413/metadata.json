  "abstract": "We study the transition form factors (TFFs) of axial-vector mesons in the context of currently available experimental data, including new constraints from $e^+ e^- \\to f_1(1285) π^+ π^-$ that imply stringent limits on the high-energy behavior and, for the first time, allow us to provide an unambiguous determination of the couplings corresponding to the two antisymmetric TFFs. We discuss how these constraints can be implemented in a vector-meson-dominance picture, and, in combination with contributions from the light-cone expansion, construct TFFs as input for the evaluation of axial-vector contributions to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.",
