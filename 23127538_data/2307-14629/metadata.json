  "abstract": "Let $F$ be a graph and $\\SPEX (n, F)$ be the class of $n$-vertex graphs which attain the maximum spectral radius and contain no $F$ as a subgraph. Let $\\EX (n, F)$ be the family of $n$-vertex graphs which contain maximum number of edges and no $F$ as a subgraph. It is a fundamental problem in spectral extremal graph theory to characterize all graphs $F$ such that $\\SPEX (n, F)\\subseteq \\EX (n, F)$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. Establishing the conjecture of Cioabă, Desai and Tait [European J. Combin., 2022], Wang, Kang, and Xue [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2023] prove that: for any graph $F$ such that the graphs in $\\EX (n, F)$ are Turán graphs plus $O(1)$ edges, $\\SPEX (n, F)\\subseteq \\EX (n, F)$ for sufficiently large $n$. In this paper, we prove that $\\SPEX (n, F)\\subseteq \\EX (n, F)$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $F$ is an $n$-vertex graph with no isolated vertices and $Δ(F) \\leq \\sqrt{n}/40$. We also prove a signless Laplacian spectral radius version of the above theorem. These results give new contribution to the open problem mentioned above, and can be seen as spectral analogs of a theorem of Alon and Yuster [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2013]. Furthermore, as immediate corollaries, we have tight spectral conditions for the existence of several classes of special graphs, including clique-factors, $k$-th power of Hamilton cycles and $k$-factors in graphs. The first special class of graphs gives a positive answer to a problem of Feng, and the second one extends a previous result of Yan et al.",
