\vspace{-2ex}\section{Conclusions \& Outlook}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we have argued the value of a probabilistically motivated position bias model to accurately estimate exposure probabilities with a minimal number of parameters.
We have presented a specific instantiation of this general idea, modelling scroll depth via the Yule-Simon distribution, and leveraging its survival function to obtain closed-form position bias estimates.
A general approach to learn distribution parameters conditional on contextual information via Maximum Likelihood Estimation, amenable to gradient descent, allows for flexible and efficient optimisation.
Using real-world data from a social media platform, we have empirically validated that our novel methods model empirical exposure significantly more accurately than competing methods, and that the obtained estimates pave the way for improvements in unbiased offline evaluation.
In future work, we wish to extend our approach to incorporate cascade-based alternatives.\looseness=-1
