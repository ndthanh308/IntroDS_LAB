  "abstract": "Robust regression has attracted a great amount of attention in the literature recently, particularly for taking asymmetricity into account simultaneously and for high-dimensional analysis. However, the majority of research on the topics falls in frequentist approaches, which are not capable of full probabilistic uncertainty quantification. This paper first proposes a new Huberised-type of asymmetric loss function and its corresponding probability distribution which is shown to have the scale-mixture of normals. Then we introduce a new Bayesian Huberised regularisation for robust regression. A by-product of the research is that a new Bayesian Huberised regularised quantile regression is also derived. We further present their theoretical posterior properties. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed models are demonstrated in the simulation studies and the real data analysis.",
