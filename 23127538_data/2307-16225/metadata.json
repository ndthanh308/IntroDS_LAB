  "abstract": "The experimental data obtained for the polarized Bjorken sum rule Γ^{(p-n)}_1(Q^2) for small values of Q2 are approximated by the predictions obtained in the framework of analytic QCD up to the 5th order perturbation theory, whose coupling constant does not contain the Landau pole. We found an excellent agreement between the experimental data and the predictions of analytic QCD, as well as a strong difference between these data and the results obtained in the framework of standard QCD.",
