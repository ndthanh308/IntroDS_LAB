  "abstract": "A comprehensive and reliable nuclear database of neutron-induced process is required by the development of Accelerator-Driven System technology. Although many excellent efforts have been made, the measurements to the fission fragment in zero degree of the beam direction is not perfect enough. Most detector can not work constantly under the strike of intense flux neutron beam, thus their application as Zero Degree Detector (ZDD) is greatly limited. Recently, the Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) technology has been developed to meet the complicated and several requirement of ATLAS on Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and could survive after $2.5\\times 10^{15}~n_{eq}/cm^2$ irradiation. With its 50 $μ$m active thickness, 30 ps temporal resolution, low cost and good radiation hardness property, the LGAD detector is expected to be an excellent candidate for the use of a Zero Degree Detector in neutron-induced process data measurements. This paper represents a performance test to LGAD detector when it is used as a ZDD on the Back-streaming Neutron (Back-n) beamline at CSNS. Measuring to the cross section of $^6Li(n,T)α$, it shows that the LGAD performs well as a ZDD based on a good agreement with the data from ENDF database.",
