  "abstract": "We consider what multiple Higgs interactions may yet reveal about the scalar sector. We estimate the sensitivity of a Feynman topology-templated analysis of weak boson Higgs pair production at present and future colliders - where the signal is a function of the Higgs coupling modifiers $κ_V$, $κ_{2V}$, and $κ_λ$. While measurements are statistically limited at the LHC, they are under general perturbative control at present and future colliders, departures from the SM expectation give rise to a significant future potential for BSM discrimination in $κ_{2V}$. We explore the landscape of BSM models in the space of deviations in $κ_V$, $κ_{2V}$, and $κ_λ$, highlighting models that have measurable order-of-magnitude enhancements in either $κ_{2V}$ or $κ_λ$, relative to their deviation in the single Higgs coupling $κ_V$.",
