  "abstract": "We present a 5D metric which interpolates between the standard 4D Schwarzschild metric with mass parameter $M$ and a new 4D $M$-deformed vacuum-defect-wormhole metric. The 5D spacetime can, in principle, have an infinite mass density that gives rise to the $M$ parameter of the 4D $M$-deformed vacuum-defect wormhole. For completeness, we also give 4D interpolating metrics between the original vacuum-defect wormhole at the wormhole throat and the $M$-deformed vacuum-defect wormhole at spatial infinity.",
