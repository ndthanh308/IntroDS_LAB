  "abstract": "For the first time, we show high-fidelity generation of LArTPC-like data using a generative neural network. This demonstrates that methods developed for natural images do transfer to LArTPC-produced images, which, in contrast to natural images, are globally sparse but locally dense. We present the score-based diffusion method employed. We evaluate the fidelity of the generated images using several quality metrics, including modified measures used to evaluate natural images, comparisons between high-dimensional distributions, and comparisons relevant to LArTPC experiments.",
