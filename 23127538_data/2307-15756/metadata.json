  "abstract": "In this paper we establish a definitive result which almost completely closes the problem of bounded elementary generation for Chevalley groups of rank $\\ge 2$ over arbitrary Dedekind rings $R$ of arithmetic type, with uniform bounds. Namely, we show that for every reduced irreducible root system $Φ$ of rank $\\ge 2$ there exists a universal bound $L=L(Φ)$ such that the simply connected Chevalley groups $G(Φ,R)$ have elementary width $\\le L$ for all Dedekind rings of arithmetic type $R$.",
