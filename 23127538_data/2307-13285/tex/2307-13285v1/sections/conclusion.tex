\section{Conclusion\label{conclusion}}
In this paper, we presented \sys, a new request cloning system that dynamically and quickly replicates requests to reduce the tail latency of microsecond-scale RPCs at scale.
Unlike traditional client-based or coordinator-based cloning approaches, \sys performs request cloning in the network switch using programmable switch ASICs.
Various technical challenges to design and implement \sys in the switch data plane were addressed.
We have implemented a prototype of \sys with an Intel Tofino switch and a cluster of commodity servers.
The experimental results showed that \sys effectively improves the tail latency of RPCs for both synthetic and real-world application workloads.
We believe that network switches would play a key role as domain-specific hardware for microsecond-scale RPCs.
We emphasize that there are remaining problems to realize the vision of in-network computing, which include fully synthesizing existing in-network solutions for microsecond-scale RPCs and integrating \sys with existing RPC frameworks.
