  "abstract": "Motivated by classical work of Alon and Füredi, we introduce and address the following problem: determine the minimum number of affine hyperplanes in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ needed to cover every point of the triangular grid $T_d(n) := \\{(x_1,\\dots,x_d)\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^d\\mid x_1+\\dots+x_d\\le n-1\\}$ at least $k$ times. For $d = 2$, we solve the problem exactly for $k \\leq 4$, and obtain a partial solution for $k > 4$. We also obtain an asymptotic formula (in $n$) for all $d \\geq k - 2$. The proofs rely on combinatorial arguments and linear programming.",
