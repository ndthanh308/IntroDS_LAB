  abstract      = "Over the past three decades significant reductions have been
                   made to the cost of estimating ground-state energies of
                   molecular Hamiltonians with quantum computers. However,
                   comparatively little attention has been paid to estimating
                   the expectation values of other observables with respect to
                   said ground states, which is important for many industrial
                   applications. In this work we present a novel expectation
                   value estimation (EVE) quantum algorithm which can be
                   applied to estimate the expectation values of arbitrary
                   observables with respect to any of the system's eigenstates.
                   In particular, we consider two variants of EVE: std-EVE,
                   based on standard quantum phase estimation, and QSP-EVE,
                   which utilizes quantum signal processing (QSP) techniques.
                   We provide rigorous error analysis for both both variants
                   and minimize the number of individual phase factors for
                   QSPEVE. These error analyses enable us to produce
                   constant-factor quantum resource estimates for both std-EVE
                   and QSP-EVE across a variety of molecular systems and
                   observables. For the systems considered, we show that
                   QSP-EVE reduces (Toffoli) gate counts by up to three orders
                   of magnitude and reduces qubit width by up to 25\% compared
                   to std-EVE. While estimated resource counts remain far too
                   high for the first generations of fault-tolerant quantum
                   computers, our estimates mark a first of their kind for both

    abstract = { Abstract We consider a generic framework of optimization algorithms based on gradient descent. We develop a quantum algorithm that computes the gradient of a multi-variate realvalued function f : ℝd → ℝ by evaluating it at only a logarithmic number of times in superposition. Our algorithm is an improved version of Jordan's gradient computation algorithm [28], providing an approximation of the gradient ▽f with quadratically better dependence on the evaluation accuracy of f, for an important class of smooth functions. Furthermore, we show that objective functions arising from variational quantum circuits usually satisfy the necessary smoothness conditions, hence our algorithm provides a quadratic improvement in the complexity of computing their gradient. We also show that in a continuous phase-query model, our gradient computation algorithm has optimal query complexity up to poly-logarithmic factors, for a particular class of smooth functions. Moreover, we show that for low-degree multivariate polynomials our algorithm can provide exponential speedups compared to Jordan's algorithm in terms of the dimension d. One of the technical challenges in applying our gradient computation procedure for quantum optimization problems is the need to convert between a probability oracle (which is common in quantum optimization procedures) and a phase oracle (which is common in quantum algorithms) of the objective function f. We provide efficient subroutines to perform this delicate interconversion between the two types of oracles incurring only a logarithmic overhead, which might be of independent interest. Finally, using these tools we improve the runtime of prior approaches for training quantum auto-encoders, variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE), and quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA). }

abstract = {{Recent advances in molecular dynamics methodology have made it possible to study routinely the microscopic details of chemical processes in the condensed phase using high-speed computers. Thus, it is timely and useful to provide a pedagogical treatment of the theoretical and numerical aspects of modern molecular dynamics simulation techniques and to show several applications that illustrate the capability of these approaches. First, the standard Newtonian or Hamiltonian dynamics based method is presented followed by a discussion of theoretical advances related to non-Hamiltonian molecular dynamics. Examples of non-Hamiltonian molecular dynamics schemes capable of generating the canonical and isothermal−isobaric ensemble are analyzed. Next, the novel Liouville operator factorization approach to numerical integration is reviewed. The power and utility of this new technique are contrasted to more basic methods, particularly, in the development of multiple time scale and non-Hamiltonian integrators. Since the results of molecular dynamics simulations depend on the interparticle interactions employed in the calculations, modern empirical force fields and ab initio molecular dynamics approaches are discussed. An example calculation combining an empirical force field and novel molecular dynamics methods, the mutant T4 lysozyme M61 in water, will be presented. The combination of electronic structure with classical dynamics, the so called ab initio molecular dynamics method, will be described and an application to the structure of liquid ammonia discussed. Last, it will then be shown how the classical molecular dynamics methods can be adapted for quantum calculations using the Feynman path integral formulation of statistical mechanics. An application, employing both path integrals and ab initio molecular dynamics, to an excess proton in water will be presented.}},

This strategy is applied to derive reversible reference system propagator algorithms (RESPA) that greatly accelerate simulations of systems with a separation of time scales or with long range forces. The new algorithms have all of the advantages of previous RESPA integrators but are reversible, and more stable than those methods. These methods are applied to a set of paradigmatic systems and are shown to be superior to earlier methods. It is shown how the new RESPA methods are related to predictor–corrector integrators. Finally, we show how these methods can be used to accelerate the integration of the equations of motion of systems with Nosé thermostats.}",

abstract={The calculation of relative free-energy differences between different compounds plays an important role in drug design to identify potent binders for a given protein target. Most rigorous methods based on molecular dynamics simulations estimate the free-energy difference between pairs of ligands. Thus, the comparison of multiple ligands requires the construction of a ``state graph'', in which the compounds are connected by alchemical transformations. The computational cost can be optimized by reducing the state graph to a minimal set of transformations. However, this may require individual adaptation of the sampling strategy if a transformation process does not converge in a given simulation time. In contrast, path-free methods like replica-exchange enveloping distribution sampling (RE-EDS) allow the sampling of multiple states within a single simulation without the pre-definition of alchemical transition paths. To optimize sampling and convergence, a set of RE-EDS parameters needs to be estimated in a pre-processing step. Here, we present an automated procedure for this step that determines all required parameters, improving the robustness and ease of use of the methodology. To illustrate the performance, the relative binding free energies are calculated for a series of checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors containing challenging transformations in ring size, opening/closing, and extension, which reflect changes observed in scaffold hopping. The simulation of such transformations with RE-EDS can be conducted with conventional force fields and, in particular, without soft bond-stretching terms.},

A faithful physicochemical understanding of these processes is crucial for the design and synthesis of chemicals and materials of value for our society and economy. Although some problems in this field can be adequately addressed by classical mechanics, many demand an explicit quantum mechanical description. Such quantum problems require a representation of wave functions that grows exponentially with system size and therefore should naturally benefit from quantum computation on a number of logical qubits that scales only linearly with system size. In this perspective, we elaborate on the potential benefits of quantum computing in the molecular sciences, i.e., in molecular physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science.},

This has led to ongoing interest to optimize and simplify these methods while retaining accuracy. Implementing quantum mechanical (QM) methods on modern hardware such as multiple-GPUs is one example of how the field is optimizing performance. Multiscale approaches like the so-called QM/molecular mechanical method are gaining popularity in drug discovery because they focus the application of QM methods on the region of choice (e.g., the binding site), while using efficient MM models to represent less relevant areas. The creation of simplified QM methods is another example, including the use of machine learning to create ultra-fast and accurate QM models. Herein, we summarize recent advancements in the development of optimized QM methods that enhance our ability to use these methods in computer aided drug discovery.}

In this work, we survey methods to calculate energy derivatives, and present two new methods: one based on quantum phase estimation, the other on a low-order response approximation. We calculate asymptotic error bounds and approximate computational scalings for the methods presented. Implementing these methods, we perform geometry optimization on an experimental quantum processor, estimating the equilibrium bond length of the dihydrogen molecule to within 0.014 Å of the full configuration interaction value. Within the same experiment, we estimate the polarizability of the H2 molecule, finding agreement at the equilibrium bond length to within 0.06 a.u. (2\% relative error).}},

Our approach leverages a mapping between the Schr\textbackslash"odinger equation and Newton's equation for harmonic potentials such that the amplitudes of the evolved quantum state encode the momenta and displacements of the classical oscillators. When individual masses and spring constants can be efficiently queried, and when the initial state can be efficiently prepared, the complexity of our quantum algorithm is polynomial in \$n\$, almost linear in the evolution time, and sublinear in the sparsity. As an example application, we apply our quantum algorithm to efficiently estimate the kinetic energy of an oscillator at any time. We show that any classical algorithm solving this same problem is inefficient and must make \$2\textasciicircum\{\textbackslashOmega(n)\}\$ queries to the oracle and, when the oracles are instantiated by efficient quantum circuits, the problem is BQP-complete. Thus, our approach solves a potentially practical application with an exponential speedup over classical computers. Finally, we show that under similar conditions our approach can efficiently simulate more general classical harmonic systems with \$2\textasciicircumn\$ modes.}}

The connection between the linear representations and the original nonlinear system is established through the Dirac delta function or the level set mechanism. We compare the quantum linear systems algorithms based methods and the quantum simulation methods arising from different numerical approximations, including the finite difference discretisations and the Fourier spectral discretisations for the two different linear representations, with the result showing that the quantum simulation methods usually give the best performance in time complexity. We also propose the Schrödinger framework to solve the Liouville equation for the HJE with the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, since it can be recast as the semiclassical limit of the Wigner transform of the Schrödinger equation. Comparison between the Schrödinger and the Liouville framework will also be made.}
