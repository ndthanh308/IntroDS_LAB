  "abstract": "Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are compact nuclear power plants that offer various advantages for energy generation in a sustainable way. With their smaller and simplified designs, SMRs provide increased flexibility, lower capital costs, and enhanced safety features compared to traditional large-scale reactors by reducing the area accommodation drastically. This paper explores the development and potential of SMRs in leading nuclear energy nations, including the United States, India, Canada, China, and Russia. Along with the physics behind it, cost optimization and advanced research & development (R&D) strategies employed to enhance the performance, safety, and finance of SMRs are discussed here. By reviewing case studies, cost reduction potentials, and technological advancements made, this study deals with the significant role of numerous factors in shaping the future of SMRs. The content presented in this research paper will not only contribute to the scientific understanding of SMRs but also provide valuable insights for policymakers, stakeholders and researchers in advancing sustainable nuclear energy solutions. Keywords: Small modular reactors (SMRs), nuclear energy, cost optimization, modularity, performance, safety, economic viability, technological advancements.",
