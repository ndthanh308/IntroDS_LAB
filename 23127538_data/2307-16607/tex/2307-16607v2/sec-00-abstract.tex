\ac{oidc} is a widely used authentication standard for the Web.
In this work, we define a new \ac{ict} \jp{to enable \ac{e2e} user authentication by using and extending \ac{oidc}'s native mechanisms}.
An \ac{ict} can be thought of as a JSON-based, short-lived user certificate for \ac{e2e} user authentication without the need for cumbersome key management.
A user can request an \ac{ict} from his \ac{op} and use it to prove his identity to other user\jp{s t}hat trust the \ac{op}.
We call this approach \ac{oidc²} and compare it to other well-known \ac{e2e} authentication methods.
Unlike certificates, \ac{oidc²} does not require installation and can be easily used on multiple devices, making it more user-friendly.
We outline protocols for implementing \ac{oidc²} based on existing standards.
We discuss the trust relationship between entities involved in \ac{oidc²}, propose a classification of \acp{op}' trust level, and propose authentication with multiple \acp{ict} from different \acp{op}.
We explain how different applications such as video conferencing, \jp{\ac{im}}, and email can benefit from \acp{ict} for \ac{e2e} authentication and recommend validity periods for \acp{ict}.
To test \ac{oidc²}, we provide a simple extension to existing \ac{oidc} server software and evaluate its performance.
