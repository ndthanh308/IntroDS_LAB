\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we presented \sysname, the first scheme to address the triangulation of satellite Internet users, and thus, protect them from being targeted.
To achieve this, \sysname leverages a local wireless communication technology to span a network between the gateways, rerouting a client's connection away from the origin gateway.
Additionally, \sysname regularly changes the output gateway for each client to avoid detection of long-lasting connections.
We thoroughly discussed different technical aspects, meeting our defined requirements to make \sysname usable with both existing Internet protocols and widely available hardware.
We implemented a prototype demonstrating \sysname's feasibility and evaluated its performance via network simulation on various real-world data sets.
