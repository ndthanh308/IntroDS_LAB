\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this article, we have proposed a new benchmark for the evaluation and comparison of NeRF-based techniques.
Focusing on one of the many concrete applications of this recent technology, i.e. \textit{vehicle inspection}, a new synthetic dataset including renderings of 8 vehicles was first created. 
In addition to the set of RGB views annotated with the camera pose, the dataset is enriched by semantic segmentation masks as well as depth maps to further analyze the results and compare the methods.

% Comparative results on some state-of-the-art methods revealed that the proposed dataset still has important challenges and unsolved issues: 
The presence of reflective surfaces and transparent parts makes the task of vehicle reconstruction still challenging.
Proposed additional metrics, as well as new graphical ways of displaying the results, are proposed to make these limitations more evident.
We are confident that \textit{\ours} can be of great help as a basis for research on NeRF models in general and, more specifically, in their application to the field of vehicle reconstruction.
