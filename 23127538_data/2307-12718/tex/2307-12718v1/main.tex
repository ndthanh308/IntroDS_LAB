\begin{abstract}
% Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are widely recognized as a highly effective technique for representing objects and scenes in 3D that are derived from 2D data. Despite their efficiency, NeRF can present challenges in specific contexts due to the large amounts of data required and the presence of reflections in the scene, which can affect reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we explore an additional use case for NeRF, \ie \textit{vehicle inspection}, aiming for a high-quality 3D vehicle reconstruction. We present \textit{\ours} as a new synthetic benchmark created in Blender and evaluate recent NeRF architectures in terms of novel view generation and depth estimation.
%RV Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have gained widespread recognition as a highly effective technique for representing 3D objects and scenes derived from 2D data. Despite their efficiency, NeRFs can pose challenges in certain scenarios due to the need for significant amounts of data and the impact of reflections on reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we investigate an additional application of NeRFs, specifically in the context of vehicle inspection, with the goal of achieving high-quality 3D reconstructions of vehicles. To this end, we introduce \textit{\ours}, a novel synthetic benchmark created in Blender, and evaluate recent NeRF architectures based on their ability to generate novel views and estimate depth.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have gained widespread recognition as a highly effective technique for representing 3D reconstructions of objects and scenes derived from sets of images. Despite their efficiency, NeRF models can pose challenges in certain scenarios such as vehicle inspection, where the lack of sufficient data or the presence of challenging elements (\eg~reflections) strongly impact the accuracy of the reconstruction. To this aim, we introduce \textit{\ours}, a novel synthetic benchmark of vehicles. In addition to a set of images annotated with their intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, the corresponding depth maps and semantic segmentation masks have been generated for each view. 
Global and part-based metrics have been defined and used to evaluate, compare, and better characterize some state-of-the-art techniques. 
The dataset is publicly released at \url{https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/go/carpatch} and can be used as an evaluation guide and as a baseline for future work on this challenging topic.
