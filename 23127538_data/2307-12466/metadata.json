  "abstract": "We prove the $C^{2,α}$ regularity of the free boundary in the Signorini problem with variable coefficients. We use a $C^{1,α}$ boundary Harnack inequality in slit domain. The key method is to study a non-standard degenerate elliptic equation and obtain a $C^{1,α}$ Schauder estimate.",
