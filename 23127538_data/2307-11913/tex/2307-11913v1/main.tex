\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we study the weighted $k$-server problem on the
  uniform metric in both the offline and online settings. We start
  with the offline setting. In contrast to the (unweighted) $k$-server
  problem which has a polynomial-time solution using min-cost flows,
  there are strong computational lower bounds for the weighted
  $k$-server problem, even on the uniform metric. Specifically, we
  show that assuming the unique games conjecture, there are no
  polynomial-time algorithms with a sub-polynomial approximation
  factor, even if we use $c$-resource augmentation for $c <
  2$. Furthermore, if we consider the natural LP relaxation of the
  problem, then obtaining a bounded integrality gap requires us to use
  at least $\ell$ resource augmentation, where $\ell$ is the number of
  distinct server weights. We complement these results by obtaining a
  constant-approximation algorithm via LP rounding, with a resource
  augmentation of $(2+\eps)\ell$ for any constant $\eps > 0$.

  \medskip
  In the online setting, an $\exp(k)$ lower bound is known for the
  competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm for the weighted
  $k$-server problem on the uniform metric. In contrast, we show that
   $2\ell$-resource augmentation  can bring the competitive
  ratio down by an exponential factor to only $O(\ell^2 \log
  \ell)$. Our online algorithm uses the two-stage approach of first
  obtaining a fractional solution using the online primal-dual
  framework, and then rounding it online.
