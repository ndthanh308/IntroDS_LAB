  "abstract": "The main goal of this paper is to determine for which prime numbers $r\\geq 3$ can an elliptic curve~$E$ defined over $\\mathbb Q$ have an $r$-isogeny over $\\mathbb Q(ζ_r)$. We study this question under various assumptions on the 2-torsion of $E$. Apart from being a natural question itself, the mod~$r$ representations attached to such $E$ arise in the Darmon program for the generalized Fermat equation of signature $(r,r,p)$, playing a key role in the proof of modularity of certain Frey varieties in the recent work of Billerey, Chen, Dieulefait and Freitas.",
