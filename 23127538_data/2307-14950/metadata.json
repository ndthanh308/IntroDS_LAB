  "abstract": "In most lattice field theories, correlators are plagued by a signal-to-noise problem of exponential difficulty in the time separation. We propose a method for improving the signal-to-noise ratio, in which control variates are systematically constructed from lattice Schwinger-Dyson relations. The method is demonstrated on various two-dimensional lattices in scalar field theory, and a strategy for scaling to larger systems is explored.",
