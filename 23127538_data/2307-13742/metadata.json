  "abstract": "We study the behavior of Dirac cohomology under Howe's $Θ$-correspondence in the case of complex reductive dual pairs. More precisely, if $(G_1,G_2)$ is a complex reductive dual pair with $G_1$ and $G_2$ viewed as real groups, we describe those Harish-Chandra modules $π_1$ of $G_1$ with nonzero Dirac cohomology whose $Θ$-liftings $Θ(π_1)$ still have nonzero Dirac cohomology. In this case, we compute explicitly the Dirac cohomology of $Θ(π_1)$.",
