  "abstract": "We have used the relativistic second-order causal viscous hydrodynamics equipped with an equation of state which includes the QCD critical point to study the propagation of linear and nonlinear perturbations in quark gluon plasma created in a relativistic heavy-ion collision. We have also studied the behaviour of dynamic structure factor, which is calculated by taking the correlation of dynamical density fluctuation. It is found that the critical point has significant effects on the propagation of linear as well as on nonlinear perturbations. It is also found that the dynamic structure factors are substantially modified with the presence of the QCD critical point.",
