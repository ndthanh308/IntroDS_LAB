\vskip 0.30cm

{\it{Firstly, I would like to thank my thesis advisor Prof. Jan-e Alam for his continuous encouragement, involvement, and suggestions in completing the thesis. 
His expertise was invaluable in formulating the research questions and methodology. No finite word can encompass my gratitude to his efforts toward completing the thesis. Especially, after I have joined Darjeeling Government College, he kept on pushing for the works to complete the thesis. The door was always open whenever I ran into a trouble or had a question about my research or writing. He consistently steered me in the right direction whenever he thought I needed it. Without his guidance, this thesis would not have been a reality. I also thank my Joint-Supervisor, Prof. Abhijit Bhattacharyya for his constant efforts and supports to carry out the works in completion of the thesis. I am really grateful to have them as my supervisors.



 I am also thankful to all my collaborators, Dr. Mahfuzur Rahaman, Dr. Golam Sarwar, Dr. Sandeep Chatterjee, Dr. Trambak Bhattacharyya, Sushant Kumar Singh, Dr. Snigdha Ghosh, and Dr. Sourav Sarkar for the academic discussions. Their mentality towards the academic activity always encourages me to enhance the academic skills. We have discussed numerous things beyond the academics, which was very much enjoyable and fascinating. 


 
I do not want to miss the chance to thank my fellow mates in VECC in my Ph.D tenure. For that I thank Rajendra, Arghya, Pingal, Somnath, Prabrisa, and Vijay. I specially thank Sarwar, Ashik, Atta da, Noor, and Mahfuzur for the distinctive mental support. We have spent quality time together even beyond my Ph.D tenure at VECC.


In this occasion, I would like to thank my teacher Partha Sarkar, who always appreciated and encouraged to pursue my career in Physics. I also thank Raju da, Dr. Shibaji Banerjee, and Dr. Suparna Roychowdhury for making the subject interesting. Their guidance are very much appreciated.


I would like to thank Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) for the financial support for the period I have spent there. I also thank the Department of Higher Education (WBHED) of Govt. of West Bengal, India for the support.

 
 Besides them, I am thankful to Amma, Abba, and Raju for the support whenever I needed it the most. The debt can never be repaid. I also want to thank my lifelong friends Bablu, Shibu, Milton Da, Moid, Saradindu and Nayan for the character installed in me. I guess the friendship among ourselves will grow stronger with time. Your support will always intrigue me.
 
 
 Finally, I would like to thank my wife Najnin Islam for her love and constant support for tolerating me over the past few years. Thank you for being my best friend. I owe you a lot.
 
 Over all, I thank the almighty for everything.}}
