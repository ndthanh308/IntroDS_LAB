  "abstract": "This chapter explores a deterministic hydrodynamically-inspired ensemble interpretation for free relativistic particles, following the original pilot wave theory conceptualized by de Broglie in 1924 and recent advances in hydrodynamic quantum analogs. We couple a one-dimensional periodically forced Klein-Gordon wave equation and a relativistic particle equation of motion, and simulate an ensemble of multiple uncorrelated particle trajectories. The simulations reveal a chaotic particle dynamic behavior, highly sensitive to the initial random condition. Although particles in the simulated ensemble seem to fill out the entire spatiotemporal domain, we find coherent spatiotemporal structures in which particles are less likely to cross. These structures are characterized by de Broglie's wavelength and the relativistic modulation frequency kc. Markedly, the probability density function of the particle ensemble correlates to the square of the absolute wave field, solved here analytically, suggesting a classical deterministic interpretation of de Broglie's matter waves and Born's rule.",
