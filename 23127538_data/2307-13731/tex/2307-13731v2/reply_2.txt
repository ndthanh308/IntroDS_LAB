Dear Editor, \newline

We are thankful to the referees for their useful comments and clarifications and recommendation for publication. Here, we respond to the points raised in the report, according to which we have made relevant revisions following the referees' comments, indicated in the same order as in the report. The modifications are highlighted in blue in the new version of the manuscript.


Report of Referee B ---------

Q1: 1. Page 6 right panel, in the newly added blue text. The ",0" in the equation is in the subscript.

R1: We thank the referee for pointing our this typo. It has been corrected now.

Q2: Throughout the work, the constraints assumed 2 supernova per century. Thus the constraints scales linearly with this input. How robust is this number? I would like to authors comment on the uncertainty of this.

R2: We have added a paragraph commenting this. It is our footnote 2 on p. 3. We conclude that this uncertainty would mildly affect the bounds on FIPs. Other uncertainties would play a more important role, see R3.

Q3: For most of the constraints, the limits are obtained using secondary emissions, which could depend significantly on the propagation parameters. How would these parameters affect the robustness of the limits? Part of this was discussed in the PRL submission, and it would be better to be discussed here for completeness as well.

R3: We have now added a paragraph discussing uncertainties on our calculations, in the conclusion section (end of p. 14 and beginning of p. 15).


We thank the referees again for their feedback and their recommendation for publication.

Regards,

Pedro De La Torre Luque, Shyam Balaji and Pierluca Carenza
