In the present work, linear response (small perturbations from an absolute Maxwellian) is addressed. In the Schrödinger representation, projection onto the hydrodynamic subspace leads to the conventional linearized Braginskii fluid equations when one restricts attention to fluxes of first order in the gradients, while the orthogonal projection leads to an alternative derivation of the Braginskii correction equations for the non-hydrodynamic part of the one-particle distribution function. The projection-operator approach provides an appealingly intuitive way of discussing the derivation of transport equations and interpreting the significance of the various parts of the perturbed distribution function; it is also technically more concise. A special case of the Weinhold metric is used to provide a covariant representation of the formalism; this allows a succinct demonstration of the Onsager symmetries for classical transport. The Heisenberg representation is used to derive a generalized Langevin system whose mean recovers the linearized Braginskii equations but that also includes fluctuating forces. Transport coefficients are simply related to the two-time correlation functions of those forces, and physical pictures of the various transport processes are naturally couched in terms of them. A number of appendices review the traditional Chapman–Enskog procedure; record some properties of the linearized Landau collision operator; discuss the covariant representation of the hydrodynamic projection; provide an example of the calculation of some transport effects; describe the decomposition of the stress tensor for magnetised plasma; introduce the linear eigenmodes of the Braginskii equations; and, with the aid of several examples, mention some caveats for the use of projection operators.}, number={4}, journal={Journal of Plasma Physics}, publisher={Cambridge University Press}, author={Krommes, John A.}, year={2018}, month={Aug}, pages={925840401}}

FI can readily leverage the proven capability of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) drivers, such as the National Ignition Facility, to assemble DT fusion fuel at the relevant high densities. FI provides a truly alternate route to ignition, independent of the difficulties with achieving the ignition hot spot in conventional ICF. FI by laser-driven ion beams provides attractive alternatives that sidestep the present difficulties with laser-driven electron-beam FI, while leveraging the extensive recent progress in generating ion beams with high-power density on existing laser facilities. Whichever the ion species, the ignition requirements are similar: delivering a power density ≈1022 W cm−3 (∼10 kJ in ≈20 ps within a volume of linear dimension ≈20 µm), to the DT fuel compressed to ∼400 g cm−3 with areal density ∼2 g cm−2. High-current, laser-driven beams of many ion species are promising candidates to deliver such high-power densities. The reason is that high energy, high-power laser drivers can deliver high-power fluxes that can efficiently make ion beams that are born neutralized in ∼fs–ps timescales, making them immune to the charge and current limits of conventional beams. In summary, we find that there are many possible paths to success with FI based on laser-driven ion beams. Although many ion species could be used for ignition, we concentrate here on either protons or C ions, which are technologically convenient species. We review the work to date on FI design studies with those species. We also review the tremendous recent progress in discovering, characterizing and developing many ion-acceleration mechanisms relevant to FI. We also summarize key recent technological advances and methods underwriting that progress. Based on the design studies and on the increased understanding of the physics of laser-driven ion acceleration, we provide laser and ion-generation laser-target design points based on several distinct ion-acceleration mechanisms.}, number={5}, journal={Nuclear Fusion}, publisher={IOP Publishing}, author={Fernández, J.

NIF has been operational since March 2009. A variety of experiments have been completed in support of NIF’s mission areas: national security, fundamental science, and inertial fusion energy. NIF capabilities and infrastructure are in place to support its missions with nearly 60 X-ray, optical, and nuclear diagnostic systems. A primary goal of the National Ignition Campaign (NIC) on the NIF was to implode a low-Z capsule filled with ∼0.2 mg of deuterium-tritium (DT) fuel via laser indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion and demonstrate fusion ignition and propagating thermonuclear burn with a net energy gain of ∼5–10 (fusion yield/input laser energy). This requires assembling the DT fuel into a dense shell of ∼1000 g/cm3 with an areal density (ρR) of ∼1.5 g/cm2, surrounding a lower density hot spot with a temperature of ∼10 keV and a ρR ∼0.3 g/cm2, or approximately an α-particle range. Achieving these conditions demand precise control of laser and target parameters to allow a low adiabat, high convergence implosion with low ablator fuel mix. We have demonstrated implosion and compressed fuel conditions at ∼80–90% for most point design values independently, but not at the same time. The nuclear yield is a factor of ∼3–10× below the simulated values and a similar factor below the alpha dominated regime.

In addition, because ignition is separate from the implosion in fast ignition, hydrodynamic mix has less opportunity to quench ignition than in the conventional process. This paper introduces some of the basic ideas of fast ignition: ignition requirements, gain curves based on simple energetic models, and integrated gain models including hohlraum and implosion physics. Because possible gains in this approach are so large, it is possible to examine the use of fuels with small tritium fractions, the so-called “advanced fuels.” In addition, the historical background of this field is discussed.}, number={3}, journal={Fusion Science and Technology}, publisher={Taylor & Francis}, author={Tabak, Max and Hinkel, Denise and Atzeni, Stefano and Campbell, E.

The review focuses on the evolution of scientific understanding gained from target-physics experiments in many areas, identifying problems that were demonstrated and the solutions implemented. The review starts with the basic understanding of laser–plasma interactions that was obtained before the declassification of laser-induced compression in the early 1970s and continues with the compression experiments using infrared lasers in the late 1970s that produced thermonuclear neutrons. The problem of suprathermal electrons and the target preheat that they caused, associated with the infrared laser wavelength, led to lasers being built after 1980 to operate at shorter wavelengths, especially 0.35 μm—the third harmonic of the Nd:glass laser—and 0.248 μm (the KrF gas laser). The main physics areas relevant to direct drive are reviewed. The primary absorption mechanism at short wavelengths is classical inverse bremsstrahlung. Nonuniformities imprinted on the target by laser irradiation have been addressed by the development of a number of beam-smoothing techniques and imprint-mitigation strategies. The effects of hydrodynamic instabilities are mitigated by a combination of imprint reduction and target designs that minimize the instability growth rates. Several coronal plasma physics processes are reviewed. The two-plasmon–decay instability, stimulated Brillouin scattering (together with cross-beam energy transfer), and (possibly) stimulated Raman scattering are identified as potential concerns, placing constraints on the laser intensities used in target designs, while other processes (self-focusing and filamentation, the parametric decay instability, and magnetic fields), once considered important, are now of lesser concern for mainline direct-drive target concepts. Filamentation is largely suppressed by beam smoothing. Thermal transport modeling, important to the interpretation of experiments and to target design, has been found to be nonlocal in nature. Advances in shock timing and equation-of-state measurements relevant to direct-drive ICF are reported. Room-temperature implosions have provided an increased understanding of the importance of stability and uniformity. The evolution of cryogenic implosion capabilities, leading to an extensive series carried out on the 60-beam OMEGA laser [Boehly et al., Opt. Commun. 133, 495 (1997)], is reviewed together with major advances in cryogenic target formation. A polar-drive concept has been developed that will enable direct-drive–ignition experiments to be performed on the National Ignition Facility [Haynam et al., Appl. Opt. 46(16), 3276 (2007)]. The advantages offered by the alternative approaches of fast ignition and shock ignition and the issues associated with these concepts are described. The lessons learned from target-physics and implosion experiments are taken into account in ignition and high-gain target designs for laser wavelengths of 1/3 μm and 1/4 μm. Substantial advances in direct-drive inertial fusion reactor concepts are reviewed. Overall, the progress in scientific understanding over the past five decades has been enormous, to the point that inertial fusion energy using direct drive shows significant promise as a future environmentally attractive energy source.}, number={11}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, publisher={American Institute of Physics}, author={Craxton, R.

A burning plasma is one in which the fusion reactions themselves are the primary source of heating in the plasma, which is necessary to sustain and propagate the burn, enabling high energy gain.

These experiments were conducted at the US National Ignition Facility, a laser facility delivering up to 1.9 megajoules of energy in pulses with peak powers up to 500 terawatts. We use the lasers to generate X-rays in a radiation cavity to indirectly drive a fuel-containing capsule via the X-ray ablation pressure, which results in the implosion process compressing and heating the fuel via mechanical work. The burning-plasma state was created using a strategy to increase the spatial scale of the capsule2,3 through two different implosion concepts4–7. These experiments show fusion self-heating in excess of the mechanical work injected into the implosions, satisfying several burning-plasma metrics3,8. Additionally, we describe a subset of experiments that appear to have crossed the static self-heating boundary, where fusion heating surpasses the energy losses from radiation and conduction.

Compared with electrons, FI based on a beam of quasi-monoenergetic ions has the advantage of a more localized energy deposition, and stiffer particle transport, bringing the required total beam energy close to the theoretical minimum. Due to short pulse laser drive, the ion beam can easily deliver the 200 TW power required to ignite the compressed D–T fuel. In integrated calculations we recently simulated ion-based FI targets with high fusion gain targets and a proof of principle experiment [1]. These simulations identify three key requirements for the success of ion-driven fast ignition (IFI): (1) the generation of a sufficiently high-energetic ion beam (≈400–500 MeV for C), with (2) less than 20% energy spread at (3) more than 10% conversion efficiency of laser to beam energy. Here we present for the first time new experimental results, demonstrating all three parameters in separate experiments. Using diamond nanotargets and ultrahigh contrast laser pulses we were able to demonstrate >500 MeV carbon ions, as well as carbon pulses with ΔE/E < 20%.

Plasmas 6 3316; Tabak M. et al 2006 Fusion Sci. Technol. 49 254). These gain models, however, all assume nearly uniform density fuel assemblies. In contrast, conventional ICF implosions yield hollowed fuel assemblies with a high-density shell of fuel surrounding a low-density, high-pressure hot spot. Hence, to realize fully the advantages of FI, an alternative implosion design must be found which yields nearly isochoric fuel assemblies without substantial hot spots. Here, it is shown that a self-similar spherical implosion of the type originally studied by Guderley (1942 Luftfahrtforschung 19 302) may be employed to yield precisely such quasi-isochoric imploded states. The difﬁculty remains, however, of accessing these self-similarly imploding conﬁgurations from initial conditions representing an actual ICF target, namely a uniform, solid-density shell at rest. Furthermore, these specialized implosions must be realized for practicable drive parameters and at the scales and energies of interest in ICF.

A scheme is proposed with three phases. First, a capsule is imploded as in the conventional approach to inertial fusion to assemble a high‐density fuel configuration. Second, a hole is bored through the capsule corona composed of ablated material, as the critical density is pushed close to the high‐density core of the capsule by the ponderomotive force associated with high‐intensity laser light. Finally, the fuel is ignited by suprathermal electrons, produced in the high‐intensity laser–plasma interactions, which then propagate from critical density to this high‐density core. This new scheme also drastically reduces the difficulty of the implosion, and thereby allows lower quality fabrication and less stringent beam quality and symmetry requirements from the implosion driver. The difficulty of the fusion scheme is transferred to the technological difficulty of producing the ultrahigh‐intensity laser and of transporting this energy to the fuel.}, number={5}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, author={Tabak, Max and Hammer, James and Glinsky, Michael E. and Kruer, William L. and Wilks, Scott C. and Woodworth, John and Campbell, E.

Plasmas 12, 055503 (2005)] provides MJ-class x-ray sources that can emit powers >0.3 PW. This capability enables benchmark experiments of fundamental material properties in radiation-heated matter at conditions previously unattainable in the laboratory. Experiments on Z can produce uniform, long-lived, and large plasmas with volumes up to 20 cc, temperatures from 1–200 eV, and electron densities from 1017–23 cc−1. These unique characteristics and the ability to radiatively heat multiple experiments in a single shot have led to a new effort called the Z Astrophysical Plasma Properties (ZAPP) collaboration. The focus of the ZAPP collaboration is to reproduce the radiation and material characteristics of astrophysical plasmas as closely as possible in the laboratory and use detailed spectral measurements to strengthen models for atoms in plasmas. Specific issues under investigation include the LTE opacity of iron at stellar-interior conditions, photoionization around active galactic nuclei, the efficiency of resonant Auger destruction in black-hole accretion disks, and H-Balmer line shapes in white dwarf photospheres.}, number={5}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, publisher={American Institute of Physics}, author={Rochau, G.

In contrast to using hard-x-rays (hv=3–6keV) proposed in the original x-ray fast-ignition proposal, we find that soft-x-ray sources with hv≈500eV photons can be suitable for igniting the dense DT-plasmas achieved on OMEGA. Two-dimensional radiation–hydrodynamics simulations have identified the break-even conditions for realizing such a “hybrid” ignition scheme (direct-drive compression with soft-x-ray heating) with 50-μm-offset targets: ∼10 ps soft-x-ray pulse (hv ≈ 500 eV) with a total energy of 500–1000J to be focused into a 10μm spot-size. A variety of x-ray pulse parameters have also been investigated for optimization. It is noted that an order of magnitude increase in neutron yield has been predicted even with x-ray energy as low as ∼50J. Scaling this idea to a 1MJ large-scale target, a gain above ∼30 can be reached with the same soft-x-ray pulse at 1.65kJ energy. Even though such energetic x-ray sources do not currently exist, we hope that the proposed ignition scheme may stimulate efforts on generating powerful soft-x-ray sources in the near future.}, number={7}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, author={Hu, S.

The required energy may be as low as 1kJ when ρrh≈0.36gcm−2,T≈20keV, and ρ≥700g cm−2. Although there are many physical challenges to creating these conditions, a possible route to producing such a hot-spot is via a bright source of non-thermal soft x-rays. Further one-dimensional simulations are used to study the non-thermal soft x-ray heating of dense DT and it is found to offer the potential to significantly reduce hydrodynamic losses as compared to particle driven fast ignition due to the hotspot being heated supersonically in a layer-by-layer fashion. A sufficiently powerful soft x-ray source would be difficult to produce, but line emission from laser-produced-plasma is the most promising option.}, number={4}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, author={Lee, J.

By extending the pulse duration from 1.5 to 6ps with fixed laser intensity of 1018Wcm−2, the maximum proton energy is improved more than twice (from 13 to 33MeV). At the same time, laser-energy conversion efficiency into the MeV protons is enhanced with an order of magnitude, achieving 5% for protons above 6MeV with the 6ps pulse duration. The proton energies observed are discussed using a plasma expansion model newly developed that takes the electron temperature evolution beyond the ponderomotive energy in the over picoseconds interaction into account.

The dependencies of proton acceleration on electron source parameters including pulse duration, temperature, and flux are independently and systematically evaluated. Proton acceleration is found to depend not only on the source size and peak temperature of the injected electrons but also on the rate of increase for a more physical time-varying temperature. Simulations of a 10 ps, sub-relativistic intensity (8×1017W/cm2) at 1μm wavelength laser pulse show that energetic electrons generated within the expanding under-dense laser-produced plasma sustain the proton acceleration for ∼20 ps. This results in 15MeV energy gain of the protons, well above what would be predicted based on conventional intensity scalings or what has been observed with shorter pulses. Using this prolonged acceleration, a scheme consisting of a 1 ps and 10 ps double pulse is shown to further boost proton maximum energy.}, number={8}, journal={Physics of Plasmas}, author={Kim, J. and Kemp, A.

Here we show that in the laser-driven accelerator that has been demonstrated experimentally to produce the highest energy protons, scaling laws derived from fluid models and supported by numerical simulations can be used to accurately describe the acceleration of proton beams for a large range of laser and target parameters.
