\section{Conclusion}

% We have demonstrated that SBI enables fine-grained uncertainty analysis and comparison of the relationship between various biomarkers and biosignals. 
We have introduced a simulation-based inference methodology to analyze complex cardiovascular simulators. 
% Our results highlight that the simulation-based inference methodology is able to extract insights consistent with variance-based sensitivity analysis. 
Our results show that our simulation-based inference method yields additional insights about 1D hemodynamics models, beyond the commonly-used VBSA and MLBSA techniques. This is done by considering the complete posterior distribution, which provides a consistent and multi-dimensional quantification of uncertainty for individual measurements.
% Furthermore, we show how simulation-based inference goes beyond variance-based sensitivity analysis owing to its fine-grained representation of uncertainty. 
This uncertainty representation enables us to recognize ambiguous inverse solutions, study the heterogeneity of sensitivity in the population considered, and understand dependencies between biomarkers in the inverse problem. Supported by results on real-world data, we have discussed the challenge of model misspecification in scientific inquiry and how to tackle it in the context of full-body hemodynamics. 
In summary, simulation-based inference enables scientists to address inverse problems in CV models, accounting for complex forward model dynamics and individualized uncertainty. Our work provides foundations for a more effective use of CV simulations for scientific inquiry and personalized medicine.

% In summary, simulation-based inference allows scientists to study inverse problems arising from CV models with a methodology that acknowledges the forward model complexity and enables an individualised representation of uncertainty. These two aspects are necessary to fully leverage CV simulations for scientific enquiry and personalised medicine.

% facilitates iterations over the scientific loop and, thus, the discovery of real-world insights from CV simulations.
% The rigour and versatility of the SBI framework should eventually enhance the scientific and real-world impact of complex cardiovascular simulations.
