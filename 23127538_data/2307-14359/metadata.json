  "abstract": "Optimization methods are essential in solving complex problems across various domains. In this research paper, we introduce a novel optimization method called Gaussian Crunching Search (GCS). Inspired by the behaviour of particles in a Gaussian distribution, GCS aims to efficiently explore the solution space and converge towards the global optimum. We present a comprehensive analysis of GCS, including its working mechanism, and potential applications. Through experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing optimization methods, we highlight the advantages and strengths of GCS. This research paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in optimization, providing insights into the development and potential of Gaussian Crunching Search as a new and promising approach.",
