% Data-driven, neural network (NN) based anomaly detection and predictive maintenance are emerging as important research areas of recent times. NN-based analytics of such time-series data provide meaningful insight and corroborative statistical evidence to help diagnose past behaviors as well as estimate the future values of critical parameters (e.g., remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment, state-of-charge (SOC) of batteries, presence of anomalies in the data, etc.). Unfortunately, the input time series data can get exposed to intentional or unintentional noise while passing through the sensors, making validating and verifying these NNs a crucial task. This paper presents a \newblue{case study of the} robustness verification approach for time series regression NN (TSRegNN), using set-based formal methods and focusing on using variable-length input data to streamline the input manipulation process and make the network architecture more generalizable. The method is then applied to two data sets in the application areas of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), (1) a Lithium-ion (li) battery's state of charge (SOC) estimation  and (2) a turbine engine's remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. The robustness of the NNs is checked using star-based reachability analysis, and several performance measures are evaluated to understand the effect of bounded perturbations in the input on network outputs (e.g., future outcomes). Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive \newblue{case study} for validating and verifying NN-based analytics of time-series data in real-world applications. It also provides insights into the importance of robustness testing for accurate and reliable predictions, i.e., to better understand the effect of any noise on its future outcome.
Data-driven, neural network (NN) based anomaly detection and predictive maintenance are emerging research areas. NN-based analytics of time-series data offer valuable insights into past behaviors and estimates of critical parameters like remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment and state-of-charge (SOC) of batteries. However, input time series data can be exposed to intentional or unintentional noise when passing through sensors, necessitating robust validation and verification of these NNs. This paper presents \newblue{a case study} of the robustness verification approach for time series regression NNs (TSRegNN) using set-based formal methods. It focuses on utilizing variable-length input data to streamline input manipulation and enhance network architecture generalizability. The method is applied to two data sets in the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) application areas: (1) SOC estimation of a Lithium-ion battery and (2) RUL estimation of a turbine engine. The NNs' robustness is checked using star-based reachability analysis, and several performance measures evaluate the effect of bounded perturbations in the input on network outputs, i.e., future outcomes. Overall, the paper offers \newblue{a comprehensive case study} for validating and verifying NN-based analytics of time-series data in real-world applications, emphasizing the importance of robustness testing for accurate and reliable predictions, especially considering the impact of noise on future outcomes.
