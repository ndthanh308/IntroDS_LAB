\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}
Processor fuzzers, which rely on the mutation of input tests, have shown promise in detecting vulnerabilities. However, they use static scheduling strategies for mutation and seed generation, which is not ideal. To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel PSO-based framework,~\ourtool{}, that can be integrated with any fuzzer to find optimal scheduling strategies. To ensure better vulnerability detection performance, we augment na\"ive PSO with (i) a reset strategy that allows it to find dynamic selection probabilities for mutation operators and (ii) a PSO-based seed generation algorithm. Experimental results with the state-of-the-art simulation-based hardware fuzzer demonstrate that~\ourtool~can speed up vulnerability detection by up to $15.25\times$ and coverage achievement by up to $2.22\times$. In conclusion,~\ourtool~addresses a critical limitation of existing processor fuzzers and significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of processor verification.
