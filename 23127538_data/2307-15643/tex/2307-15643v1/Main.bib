Furthermore, aesthetic features, durability, and portability are essential properties of glasses. However, designing such smart glasses is challenging, because connecting different glass frames both mechanically and electrically, result in smart glasses with bulky hinges. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new design to embed inductively coupled coil pairs adjacent to glasses hinges to deliver power and data wirelessly to the frames. Positioning the coils next to the hinges creates sufficient area for a large transmission and reception coil while maintaining the utility of the glasses. Consequently, we were able to achieve over 85\% power efficiency and a communication rate of 50 Mbps between coils that are small enough to be embedded inside the frame of conventional glasses, available on the market.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2020 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers}, pages = {79–83}, numpages = {5}, keywords = {wireless communication, smart glasses, wireless power transfer, wearables}, location = {Virtual Event, Mexico}, series = {ISWC '20} }
