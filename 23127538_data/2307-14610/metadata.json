  "abstract": "We consider a disjoint cover (partition) of an undirected weighted finite graph $G$ by $|J|$ connected subgraphs (clusters) $\\{S_{j}\\}_{j\\in J}$ and select a function $ζ_{j}\\geq 0$ on each of the clusters. For a given signal $f$ on $G$ the set of its weighted average values samples is defined via inner products $\\{\\langle ζ_{j}, f\\rangle\\}_{j\\in J}$. The goal of the paper is to establish exact quadrature formulas with positive weights which are exploring these samples generated by bandlimited functions.",
