  "abstract": "We present on shell-scheme for the 2PI formalism with a particular focus on the renormalized equations of motion. We first revisit the so-called Hartree approximation where we give the counterterms for both the broken and unbroken phase. Moreover, we give explicit formulas for the renormalized three- and four-point functions in the broken phase. We then turn to the sunset approximation, with only scalars and then including fermions. We give explicit formulas for the wavefunction and mass counterterms. Moreover, we show that, in particular, the two-point functions can be obtained numerically in a fast converging scheme even for large couplings of order one.",
