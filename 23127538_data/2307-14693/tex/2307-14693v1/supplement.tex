\section{I. Numerical Methods} \label{sec:app1}
\subsection{Time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) simulations}
For the TDHF simulations, we employ a hydrogen crystal system, which is known to exhibit strongly bound excitons \cite{PhysRevA.98.023415,PhysRevLett.127.077401}. Electrons are driven along the laser polarization direction through a periodic chain of hydrogen dimers with a bond length of $ 1.6 $ Bohr and lattice constant of $ a=3.6 $ Bohr. The interaction between nuclei, located at $ x_i $, and electrons are described with the softened Coulomb potential $v_{\mathrm{ion}} \left( x\right) = - \sum_i [\left(x-x_i \right)^2 + 1]^{-1/2}$. The dynamics are solved by propagating a set of orthonormal electron orbitals $\varphi_{i}^{\mathrm{HF}} \left(x ,t \right)$, through the velocity gauge formalism of the TDHF equation
\begin{equation}
i \partial_t \varphi_{i}^{\mathrm{HF}}(t) = \left\lbrace \frac{1}{2}\left[-i\partial_x +  A\left(t \right) \right]^2   + v_{\mathrm{ion}}(x) + v_H \left[n \right](x,t) + \widehat{v}_X \left[\lbrace \varphi_{j}^{\mathrm{HF}} (t)\rbrace\right] \right\rbrace \varphi_{i}^{\mathrm{HF}}(t).
\end{equation} 
Here $A\left(t\right)$ is the vector potential describing the applied laser pulse in the electric dipole approximation. The electron-electron interaction is described by the Hartree potential $v_H \left[ n \right] \left( x,t \right) = \int dx' n\left( x',t\right)[\left(x-x' \right)^2 + 1]^{-1/2}$, and the nonlocal exchange operator, which applied to an orbital is given as 
\begin{equation}
\widehat{v}_X \left[\lbrace \varphi_{j}^{\mathrm{HF}}(t) \rbrace\right]\varphi_{i}^{\mathrm{HF}}(t) = - \sum_{k=1}^{N} \varphi_{k}^{\mathrm{HF}}(x,t) \int dx' \varphi_{k}^{\mathrm{HF}*}(x',t)\varphi_{i}^{\mathrm{HF}}(x',t)[\left(x-x' \right)^2 + 1]^{-1/2}.
\end{equation}
 The density is $n \left(x,t\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \abs{\varphi_{i}^{\rm HF} \left( x ,t\right)}^2 $. 
The ground state orbitals are obtained by a self-consistent iterative process of solving the HF equation starting from a linear combination of atomic orbitals using the Octopus software package \cite{doi:10.1063/1.5142502}. Hereafter, the TDHF equation is propagated using an enforced time-reversal symmetry propagator utilizing the adaptively compressed exchange operator formulation \cite{Lin2016}, and using a predictor-corrector scheme to guarantee that we reach self-consistency at every time step $\Delta t$, with $\Delta t=0.242$ as. Furthermore, we apply a singularity correction to treat divergent terms from the exchange energy \cite{PhysRevB.75.205126}, that we adapted to the one-dimensional case. %

 The calculation for the periodic hydrogen chain model is performed using a converged real-space grid spacing of 0.4 Bohr. For the crystal momentum-space grid, convergence was achieved using 1024 grid points or increasing to 2048 grid points for the highly excited systems. Part of the bandstructure of the system is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:12}. From the band structure, we observe a direct bandgap of $9.45$ eV, which corresponds to $15.24$ harmonic orders of the HHG-generating probe pulse with a wavelength of $2000$ nm ($\sim 0.62$ eV). 
 
The linear absorption spectrum is obtained by the application of the small $\delta$-kick \cite{PhysRevB.62.7998} followed by a time evolution, and is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:13}. With this, we obtain the pump frequencies for exciting the system. The first one,  $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}} = 3.86$ eV, corresponds to resonantly driving the transition to the strongly bound exciton. The second one, $\omega_{\mathrm{bg}} = 9.45$ eV, is resonant with the minimum bandgap, where valence and conduction bands have a high density of states. This second transition can provide energy for an exciton resonant transition from lower\Sadd{-}energy electrons of the valence band, however, with a weak coupling due to the low density of states at the associated section of the valence band. 


\subsection{Time-resolved exciton wavefunctions}

The exciton wavefunction is constructed from the single-particle transition density matrix (TDM), by the procedure of Ref.~\cite{doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.0c01334}. The protocol relies on the transition density matrix, which has been helpful for the analysis and interpretation of excited states of molecular systems. When extended beyond the linear response regime for TDDFT and TDHF, the time-dependent TDM is constructed as a sum of weighted transition amplitudes. What makes it particularly useful, is that the TDM offers a way to resolve a given excitation in a spatial map constructed of pure single-particle excitations. In that way, the time-dependent TDM\Sadd{,} $\Gamma_s (x,x',t)$\Sadd{,} for a given excitation represents weighted transition amplitudes of processes where a particle is annihilated at position $x$ and created at position $x'$ \cite{LI2011157}. One can thus think of the TDM as accounting for the conditional probability of finding an electron at a certain place given the position of the associated hole. 
For real-time TDHF, the time-dependent TDM can be calculated at a specific time $t$ utilizing the HF orbitals at that time $\varphi_{\sigma,i}^{\mathrm{HF}} \left(x ,t \right)$, which has been propagated from their ground state $\varphi_{\sigma,i}^{\mathrm{HF}} \left(x,t=0\right)=\varphi_{\sigma,i}^{\mathrm{HF}} \left(x\right)$. The time-dependent TDM is denoted here as the difference between the time-dependent and the ground state one-body density matrices, which can be evaluated as
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_s (x, x', t) = \sum_i^{\text{occ}}\left[\varphi_{i}^{\mathrm{HF}} \left(x ,t \right) \varphi_{i}^{\mathrm{HF}\ast} \left(x' ,t \right) - \varphi_{i}^{\mathrm{HF}} \left(x\right) \varphi_{i}^{\mathrm{HF}\ast}\left(x' \right) \right]. \nonumber 
\end{equation}
For periodic systems, it is expressed using the knowledge of orbitals inside the unit cell thanks to Bloch's theorem. However, the distances $x$ and $x'$ of the time-dependent TDM reside in the full crystal, given by the unit cell volume multiplied by the number of $k$-points used in the simulation. Indeed, the exciton occupies the entire crystal structure. To associate some physical insight into the TDM, we note that the diagonal of the TDM contains the time-dependent density response associated with the given excitation $\Gamma_s (x, x, t) = \delta n(x,t)$, with $\delta n(x,t) = n(x,t) - n(x,t=0)$. Since the integrated density remains constant with time, this enforces that $\int dx \left[ \Gamma_s (x,x,t) \right] = 0$. In quantum chemistry, the time-dependent TDM has been shown to be analogous to the exciton wavefunction given from Green's function theory \cite{C5CP07077E}. In obtaining the time-dependent TDM in real space, one can extract information with regards to the dynamical exciton processes, such as dissociation rates or charge separation rates. In the present work, we fix the hole at $x'=0$. A complete quantitative analysis would require to scan both the electron and hole coordinate. But due to the large-scale structure of the TDM being diagonally dominated, we conclude that qualitative features can be inferred from the TDM with the hole placed at the center between the two nuclei. In the following and in the main text, we refer to $\Gamma_s (x, x'=0, t)$ as the exciton wavefunction for the case of the hole being localized at $x'=0$.

\subsection{First moment of the exciton wave function}
In the reference frame of the hole, the first moment is given as 
\begin{equation}
m = \frac{\int dx \abs{x} \abs{\Gamma_s (x,0,t)}^2}{\int dx \abs{\Gamma_s (x,0,t)}^2}
\end{equation}
and normalized to the excitation magnitude. As observed in Fig.~1 of the main text and argued in the main text, the system prepared with bound excitons have a first moment of a few \AA. If the system is pumped with free carriers, then the first moment will be hundreds of \AA~for our system.


\subsection{Number of excitons and free carriers}

We now want to extract information from the exciton wavefunction $\Gamma_s (x, x'=0, t)$, to give a description of the number of excitons or free carriers in a given excitation. To do this, we consider the exciton wavefunction and assume that it consists of the contributions from excitons and free carriers. We assume that exciton population, gives a localized exciton wavefunction, or in other words, a large conditional probability of finding the electron near its hole. As observed in Figs.~1~(c),(d) of the main text, this contribution has an exponential scaling with distance and a first moment of less than $5$ \AA. The other contribution to the exciton wavefunction is originating from free carriers. We assume that these latter carriers provide a relatively uniform distribution of the exciton wavefunction with regards to distance. This is since the excited carriers are traversing freely throughout the lattice and thus have a uniform conditional probability for finding electron relative to its hole. Based on these two different contributions to the exciton wavefunction, we can interpret the ratio of such contributions to imply the ratio of excitons to free carriers for a given excitation. Normalizing these measures with the number of excited valence electrons per unit cell, $N_\text{e}$, we can obtain the number of excitons $N_\text{ex}$ and the number of free carriers $N_\text{fc}$ for a given excitation. 

The number of free carriers can be calculated as the contribution of the exciton wavefunction, which is uniform with respect to distance. To calculate this contribution, we integrate the exciton wavefunction from beyond the point at which the excitonic contribution is dominant, which we denote as the exciton radius $x_{\text{ex}}$. The average value of the exciton wavefunction in this region is then extended across the full crystal length $L$ to give the free-carrier contribution to the exciton wavefunction. The ratio of this contribution to the total size of the exciton wavefunction, provide the ratio of free carriers for the excitation and multiplying with number of excited valence electrons, we obtain the number of free carriers as 



\begin{equation}
N_\text{fc}(t) = N_\text{e} (t)  \frac{L}{L-x_{\text{ex}}} \frac{\int^{L}_{x_{\text{ex}}} dx  |\Gamma_s (x,0,t)|^2 }{ \int^{L}_0 dx | \Gamma_s (x,0,t)|^2}. \label{eq:fc}
\end{equation}

From Fig.~1 (a) in the main text we identify $r_{\text{ex}} = 5$ Å as the radius of the bound exciton, in the low-exciton concentration regime, and we use this $x_{\text{ex}}$ for characterising the excitonic localization. The number of excited valence electrons per unit cell is defined as
\begin{equation}
N_\text{e} (t) =  N_\text{tot}  - \sum^\text{occ}_{n,n'}  \abs{\bra{\varphi_{n}^\mathrm{HF} (t)} \ket{\varphi_{n'}^\mathrm{HF} (t=0)} }^2 \label{eq:e}
\end{equation}
and is computed during our simulations, with $N_\text{tot}$ being the total number of valence electrons. This allows us to compute $N_\text{fc}(t)$ from $N_\text{e} (t)$ and $\Gamma_s (x,0,t)$. The remaining excitation must then consist of excitons, which can be found from 
\begin{equation}
N_\text{ex} (t) =  N_\text{e} (t) - N_\text{fc} (t)  \label{eq:ex} 
\end{equation}
We note, that with the definitions from Eqs.~\eqref{eq:fc},\eqref{eq:e} and \eqref{eq:ex} a completely uniform exciton wavefunction will give $N_\text{fc} = N_\text{e}$ and $N_\text{ex}=0$. Similarly the limit of completely localized electron wavefunction within $r_\text{ex}$ will provide $N_\text{fc} = 0 $ and $N_\text{ex} = N_\text{e}$. 

\section{II. Exciton model within the effective mass approximation}

To further understand the effect of the probe laser on the exciton population, we modelled the dynamics of the exciton within the effect mass approximation.
For this we follow the works of Ogawa and Takagahara~\cite{PhysRevB.43.14325,PhysRevB.44.8138} that we extend to the time-dependent case. Here we review the derivation starting from a three-dimensional two-body electron-hole time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation within a laser field linearly polarized along the $z$ direction 
\begin{eqnarray}
 i\hbar\partial_t \Phi(\mathbf{r_e},\mathbf{r_h},t) = \Big(\frac{1}{2m_e}(-i\hbar\nabla_e-\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}(t))^2 +\frac{1}{2m_h}(-i\hbar\nabla_h+\frac{e}{c}\mathbf{A}(t))^2 + U_e(\mathbf{r_e}) + \nonumber\\ U_h(\mathbf{r_h}) + V(\mathbf{r_e},\mathbf{r_h}) \Big) \Phi(\mathbf{r_e},\mathbf{r_h},t)\,,\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Phi(\mathbf{r_e},\mathbf{r_h})$ is commonly referred to as the exciton envelope function, $m_e$ ($m_h$) is the effective mass of an electron (a hole), $V$ is the Coulomb interaction, $U_e$ ($U_h$) the confining potential acting on the electron (hole), and $\mathbf{A}(t)=A(t)\mathbf{\hat{e}_z}$ is the vector potential of the laser.\\

Assuming a strong confinement of the carriers in the lateral directions, we can apply the envelope approximation, which assumes that~\cite{PhysRevB.44.8138}
\begin{equation}
 \Phi(\mathbf{r_e},\mathbf{r_h},t) = e^{iKZ}f_e(x_e,y_e,t)f_h(x_h,y_h,t)\phi(\mathbf{r_e}-\mathbf{r_h},t)\,,
\end{equation}
where $Z$ and $K$ are  $z$ coordinate of the center of mass of the exciton and the corresponding wavenumber, and $f_e$ and $f_h$ are the lowest sub-band functions in the lateral directions for the electron and the hole. Finally $\phi$ describes the relative motion of the electron and the hole. 
After some algebra, and assuming that $f_e$ and $f_h$ remain normalized to unity at all times and that $\phi$ only depend on $z=z_e-z_h$, we obtain a one-dimensional time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{eqnarray}
 i\hbar  \partial_t \phi(z,t) = \Big(\frac{1}{2\mu}(\partial_z^2 -\frac{e}{c}A(t))+ \frac{\hbar^2}{2(m_e+m_h)}K^2
 + V_{\rm eff}(z) + eE(t)z  \Big)  \phi(z,t) \,,\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mu$ is the exciton reduced mass, $V_{\rm eff}(z) = \int dx_edy_edx_hdy_h V(\mathbf{r_e},\mathbf{r_h}) |f_e(x_e,y_e)|^2|f_h(x_e,y_e)|^2$ is the confinement potential. We used here the fact that the confining potentials $U_e$ and $U_h$ are time independent, and hence the $V_{\rm eff}$ is time independent. Assuming that the energy of the center-of-mass motion $\frac{\hbar^2}{2(m_e+m_h)}K^2$ remain constant during the time evolution, this term can be transformed away and we have thus reduced the exciton problem to time-evolution of a one-dimensional problem of a single particle within an electric field, with the only change that the particle has a reduced mass $\mu$.
This equation is easily solved using any software capable of propagating in time a one-dimension time-dependent Scr\"odinger equation, and in this work, this is numerically solved using the Octopus code~\cite{doi:10.1063/1.5142502}.\\

In order to estimate how much the exciton are dissociated by the pump itself, we now perform simulations of the exciton dynamics under the envelope approximation, as described above, to simulate the dissociation process induced by pump laser. For this, we let the exciton wavepacket evolve in time under the influence of the pump laser and we place absorbing boundaries at a distance of 500 Bohr from the center of the simulation box, to absorb the part of the wavepacket that dissociates under the influence of the laser.
This allows us to estimate the fraction of dissociated exciton population for various laser intensities. The results of the simulations are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:populations}. We employed here a grid spacing of 0.4 Bohr, and used a simulation for a radius 600 Bohr, including 100 Bohr wide absorbing boundary region using a complex absorbing potential of height -0.2 with a sin-square envelope~\cite{de2015modeling}. \\

This simple modelling shows that pump-induced exciton dissociation is a very important when the intensity reaches values closes to 10$^{11}$ W cm$^{-2}$ and above. 



\section{III. HHG spectra for weakly excited or unexcited systems}
% Figure environment removed

Throughout our work a $\sin^2$-pulseshape is applied for both pump and probe pulses. The duration of the pump (probe) pulse is $25$ fs ($100$ fs) with a peak-to-peak delay of $72.5$ fs. The probe intensity is kept at $10^{12}$ W cm$^{-2}$, whereas a wide scan of pump intensities has been explored. For the pump-probe systems, we consider an experiment of orthogonally oriented polarization for the pump and probe pulse respectively, such that the perturbative response of the pump is not present in the HHG spectra. To account for this along the one-dimensional model, we only consider the probe-induced current for the spectra, which is the current induced by the probe when affecting a pump-prepared system. Numerically this corresponds to considering $J(t) = J_{\text{pump-probe}}(t) - J_{\text{pump}}(t)$, with $J_{\text{pump-probe}}(t)$ being the system response to a pump-probe scheme, and $J_{\text{pump}}(t)$ being the system response to only a pump pulse. Here $J(t)$ is the electric current, evaluated by 
\begin{equation}
J(t)= \sum_{i,\sigma} \int dx \Re \left[\varphi^{\text{HF}\ast} _{i,\sigma} \left( x,t \right) \left( -i \pdv{x} + A\left(t\right)\right) \varphi_{i,\sigma}^{\text{HF}} \left( x,t \right)  \right].
\end{equation}
From this, the HHG spectra are obtained as 
\begin{equation}
S(\omega) \propto  \abs{ \omega \int dt J\left( t \right) e^{-i\omega t}}^2
\end{equation}
When performing the Fourier transform, a window function is applied with a $\cos^8$ decay to attenuate the current at the very end of the simulated interval to avoid numerical artifacts.
We have investigated the response for samples prepared with a low degree of excitation of either excitons or free carriers in Fig.~\ref{fig:7}. The exciton-seeded system is prepared with a $10^6$ W cm$^{-2}$ $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}$-pump and the free carrier-seeded system is prepared with a $10^{10}$ W cm$^{-2}$ $\omega_{\mathrm{bg}}$-pump. The degree of excitation can be retrieved from Fig.~1 (f) in the main text. We observe the harmonic emission of both seeded systems to largely resemble the response from the unpumped system. The small discrepancies are observed around the pump-frequencies. An intensity scan reveals, that for modification of the HHG process due to the seeding of the sample, the pump must provide an excitation of $10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ valence electrons per unit cell. For the unpumped system, we recover similar features as in Ref.~\cite{PhysRevA.98.023415}.

\section{IV. Exciton-seeded interband enhancement}
% Figure environment removed
% Figure environment removed

In the strong excitation regime, we have investigated the effect of a large degree of free carriers or exciton excitation. To do this, we consider a bound exciton-seeded system prepared with a $10^8$ W cm$^{-2}$ $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}$-pump, which is known to produce a large population of bound excitons from Fig.~1 (f) in the main text. To compare, we chose a $10^{12}$ W cm$^{-2}$ $\omega_{\mathrm{bg}}$-pump, as this generates an excitation, which is $2.3$ times larger in magnitude than the $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}$-pump, but consist mainly of free carriers, but also a fraction~1\% of bound excitons. The excitons can be generated both as a consequence of free carriers recombining to form excitons, or by the $\omega_\mathrm{bg}$-pump coupling directly to excited exciton states from the valence band. Both system are now prepared in a state with a large excitation and we thus observe a more convoluted system response in Fig.~\ref{fig:8}. Considering, e.g., the free carrier-seeded system response, we see an enhancement of the exciton resonance and sidepeaks as well, since this system is also seeded with an significant fraction of excitons. Actually, the number of excitons generated here is comparable with the exciton-seeded system of Fig.~3 (b) in the main text, which show a similar enhancement of the exciton-related peaks. For the intense exciton-seeded spectrum in Fig.~\ref{fig:8}, we observe a more significant enhancement of the exciton peak and sidepeaks. Furthermore, here we also observe the exciton-seeded sample to have an enhancement across the first plateau. This enhancement can be explained as a significant part of the seeded bound exciton population can dissociate to free carriers, during the probe pulse. This dissociation is directly observed if considering the exciton wavefunction in Fig.~\ref{fig:9} (b) where an additional contribution is observed from dissociated excitons, which form carriers into the first conduction band and can contribute to intraband transitions across the first plateau, as observed in Fig.~2 (b) in the main text.  Interestingly, our TDHF calculation predicts, that seeding the sample with excitons is expected to be more efficient than seeding the sample with free carriers for above bandgap harmonic enhancement. This is despite of the fact, that here in Fig.~\ref{fig:8}, degree of excitation in the free carrier-seeded system is $2.3$ times larger than the excitation of the exciton-seeded sample. In Fig.~\ref{fig:9} (a) we also observe, that around $75$ fs, a substantial dissociation of excitons is observed, which correspond to the time at which the interband harmonics are initially generated in Fig.~2~(a) in the main text.








\section{V. Exciton-extended semiclassical interband model}

For interband HHG processes a trajectory-based semiclassical model have been developed based on solving the semiconductor Bloch equations with the saddle-point approximation \cite{PhysRevB.91.064302}. It has succeeded in describing cutoff energies, and extended to capture imperfect collisions and Umklapp scattering \cite{PhysRevA.102.033105,PhysRevResearch.2.033333}. Here we extend this model to include recombination paths associated with excitons, but note that imperfect collisions and Umklapp scattering might also intricate the dynamics here. First step of the interband model, is the generation of a electron-hole pair at the bandgap of the solid. We do not distinguish whether the electron-hole pair is generated from exciting an electron from the valence to conduction band, or whether these are generated by the dissociation of an exciton. As both these processes will most likely result in the generation of a electron-hole pair at the bandgap of the solid. The relative distance between the electron and hole $\Delta x(t)$ is now propagated from the generation time $t_0$ using the conduction and valence band velocity $v_c(k)$ and $v_v(k)$ as
\begin{equation}
\Delta x(t)= \int_{t_0}^t\lbrace v_c[k(t')]-v_v[k(t')] \rbrace dt', 
\end{equation}
The relative velocity is expressed from the curvature of the bandstructure for the valence and conduction bands, $\varepsilon_{v}(k)$ and $\varepsilon_{c}(k)$ as
\begin{equation}
v_c(k(t'))-v_v(k(t')) = \pdv{\left[\varepsilon_{c}\left(k(t')\right) - \varepsilon_{v}\left(k(t') \right) \right]}{k}
\end{equation}
with crystal momenta governed by the acceleration theorem  
\begin{equation}
k(t)= k_0 + A(t).
\end{equation}
During propagation, the electron and hole might recombine at a recombination time $t_r$, where $\Delta x(t_r)=0$. At the recombination step, the electron and hole pair is assumed to recombine and emit their excess energy. This leads to two pathways, (1) recombination to the valence band, and (2) recombination to an exciton.  The second pathway is the exciton-extension to the model, and is constructed similar to the recombination into a donor-doped state of Ref. \cite{PhysRevA.99.013435}. The energies emitted for the different recombination steps are given as
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item Recombination with emission of the electron-hole pair energy of $\varepsilon_{c}\left[k\left(t_r\right)\right] - \varepsilon_{v}\left[k\left(t_r\right)\right]$
    \item Recombination into an exciton of exciton binding energy $E_b$ with emission of $\varepsilon_{c}\left[k\left(t_r\right)\right] - E_b$
 \end{enumerate}
With these two pathways of recombination, the time-frequency profile of the harmonic emission is two bands, following the well\Sadd{-}established interband emission chirp.



\section{VI. Exciton energy shift}

% Figure environment removed

In the time\Sadd{-}frequency analysis of Fig. 2 of the main text, it is observed that the exciton features of the harmonic spectra is shifted in energy during the interaction with the driving pulse. This leads to\Sadd{,} e.g.\Sadd{,} the exciton features of the harmonic spectrum having a wider spectral width, when considering the HHG spectra of Fig. 3 of the main text. Such energy shift could be a result of a weakening of the binding energy due to presence of excited carriers, or mechanisms such as the excitonic Stark effect. We report the energy shift to be increasing with the intensity of the probe pulse, and thus the degree of excited carriers. To support this, we provide time\Sadd{-}frequency analysis with a scan of probe intensities in the regime of $10^{11}$ to $2 \times 10^{12}$ W cm$^{-1}$ for the exciton-seeded sample of Fig.~2~(d) in the main text. A time-frequency analysis of the emitted harmonics during the probe pulse is given in Fig. \ref{fig:10}, and we clearly observe how the exciton resonance, and sidebands have a larger displacement in energy at higher pulse intensities.
