\begin{abstract}
We explore the nonlinear response of ultrafast strong-field driven excitons in a one-dimensional solid with \textit{ab initio} simulations. We demonstrate from our simulations and analytical model that a finite population of excitons imprints unique signatures to the high-harmonic spectra of materials. We show the exciton population can be retrieved from the spectra. We further demonstrate signatures of exciton recombination and that a shift of the exciton level is imprinted into the harmonic signal. The results open the door to high-harmonic spectroscopy of excitons in condensed-matter systems. %

\maketitle

When semiconductor or insulator systems interact with light, their optical linear and non linear responses is often dominated by features arising due to bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons \cite{RevModPhys.83.543}. 
Excitons are consequential in photonic technology \cite{PhysRevB.94.041401} and play a significant role in many processes, such as energy transfer and light absorption in bio-molecules~\cite{bardeen2014structure, spano2006excitons}, nanostructures~\cite{spano2006excitons}, and solids\cite{cudazzo2015exciton,mueller2018exciton}, and have fundamental and technological applications.
Bound excitons give rise to sharp peaks in absorption and photoluminescence spectra, which exhibit optical features such as the Stark effect \cite{PhysRevLett.92.157401}, Rabi oscillations \cite{PhysRevLett.87.133603} and Fano resonances \cite{PhysRevLett.74.470}. 
Understanding how they behave under external perturbations such as ultrafast intense fields is therefore key to make use of them for future applications like PHz electronics and guide experimental observations by providing microscopical understanding of their pump probe date.


Excitons arise in different forms, such as interlayer excitons, optically dark excitons, strongly bound excitons  to name a few \cite{Mueller2018,Merkl2019}, and are important for the properties of bulk materials but also low-dimensional materials~\cite{RevModPhys.90.021001,qiu2019giant,manzeli20172d,PhysRevLett.113.026803}, van der Walls heterostructures \cite{Rivera2015}, and twistronics ~\cite{patel2015tunable,Tran2019}. 
The development of methods allowing to study the dynamics of excitons, is an active area of research, including the study of exciton formation~\cite{trovatello2020ultrafast}, ultrafast dynamics ~\cite{pogna2016photo,jiang2021real,PhysRevLett.128.016801}, condensation~\cite{PhysRevB.103.L241404}, dissociation~\cite{massicotte2018dissociation}, and coupling to other degrees of freedom~\cite{PhysRevB.105.085111,li2021exciton}. 

While excitons are know to play important roles in many aspects of material science, and can even dominate in linear and perturbative nonlinear spectroscopies in solids, it is common to neglect excitonic effects in describing electron dynamics induced by intense laser fields. This approach is in the spirit of the strong-field approximation of atomic physics, in which the laser field 
is assumed to dominate over the Coulomb interaction~\cite{PhysRevA.49.2117} , thus motivated a description in terms of independent particles. 
It is thus rationalized, that either excitons do not form or that any bound exciton present in the material would dissociate during strong-field processes \cite{RevModPhys.90.021002}. In this work, however, we show that for typical laser parameters used for strong-field physics in solids, this argument fails for strongly bound excitons. Indeed, the latter are shown to modify the ultrafast optical response of condensed matter systems. 

With recent experiments on nonlinear exciton dynamics in THz harmonic sideband generation  \cite{Langer2016,Zaks2012} and in attosecond transient reflection and absorption spectroscopy \cite{Lucchini2021,PhysRevLett.124.207401,doi:10.1126/science.aan4737,Kobayashi2023}, it is crucial to elucidate the dynamics of excitons under intense laser fields, in order to support a complete understanding of light-matter interactions. Here we consider their impact on the process of high-order harmonic generation (HHG). HHG utilizes the ultrafast nonlinear response of a material to generate ultrashort coherent pulses, which inherit spectrographic information from the underlying electron dynamics \cite{PhysRevA.66.023805,PhysRevLett.98.203007,doi:10.1126/science.1163077,doi:10.1126/science.1123904,PhysRevLett.94.053004,Itatani2004,Schubert2014,Garg2018,PhysRevLett.115.193603}. 
So far, most condensed-matter HHG experiments are rationalized in terms of independent-electron models, which ignore excitons, but are capable of describing energy-cutoff scaling, spectral features \cite{Ghimire2011,Schubert2014,Luu2015,PhysRevB.102.104308,heide2021probing}, orientation and polarization dependencies \cite{You2017,PhysRevLett.120.243903}, as well as reconstruction of bandstructure \cite{Lanin:17,Lanin:19} and Berry curvature \cite{Luu2018} even if topological signatures in HHG remain elusive ~\cite{2303.17300}. Experimental indications of possible excitonic effects have arisen in HHG as a plateau %
in rare-gas solids \cite{Ndabashimiye2016}, an increased efficiency of monolayer compared to bulk crystals \cite{Liu2017} and a characteristic delay-dependency in pump-probe HHG \cite{heide2021probing}. However, a clear demonstration of excitonic effects related to a controlled exciton population in HHG remains elusive.
In the semiconductor Bloch equations (SBE) formalism, it was already indicated that excitons could be important for interpreting the HHG mechanisms, as the relative importance of inter- or intraband contributions are altered if the Coulomb interaction is tuned to reproduce accurate exciton binding energies %
\cite{Garg2016}. Recently, excitons have also been predicted to influence HHG in Mott insulators and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, in the framework of effective Hamiltonian models \cite{PhysRevB.105.L241108, PhysRevResearch.2.023072,PhysRevA.105.063504}. 

A few approaches may capture excitons in real-time \textit{ab initio} simulations, like non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) ~\cite{PhysRevB.37.941, stefanucci2013nonequilibrium,balzer2012nonequilibrium}, based on the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ~\cite{PhysRevB.34.6933}. While important progresses have been made ~\cite{PhysRevLett.128.016801,PhysRevB.105.125134}, this method is still numerically prohibitive, and one needs to employ simpler methods like time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF)\cite{PhysRevLett.33.582}, or the related hybrid functionals in TDDFT~\cite{PhysRevLett.89.096402}.
Hybrid functionals allow to explore ultrafast and nonlinear electrons dynamics \cite{PhysRevLett.127.077401} with low-cost and accurate alternatives to NEGF~\cite{PhysRevResearch.2.013091} but is restricted on e.g. the dimensionality. Furthermore, the formalism within TDDFT to provide access to time-resolved visualization of the exciton wavefunction \cite{doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.0c01334}, and thus provide insights on the exciton dynamics in space and time is also applicable for the more established TDHF formalism. 


In light of this, we perform here real-time \textit{ab initio} wavefunction-based TDHF simulations to characterize nonlinear ultrafast exciton dynamics and how excitons modify the HHG response in realistic pump-probe setting. Simulations are performed for an one-dimensional insulating hydrogen crystal, that has strongly bound excitons ~\cite{PhysRevA.98.023415,PhysRevLett.127.077401}, and is therefore ideal for unraveling the fundamental ultrafast exciton dynamics.

We first investigate how an exciton population in the material is created. For this, we pump the material with a laser under different excitation conditions. We need to define a criterion to isolate the effect of the pump laser regarding excitation of free-carriers or excitons. We determine the nature of the excitation by analyzing the real-time dynamics of the exciton wavefunction~\cite{doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.0c01334} %
From the norm of the approximated exciton wavefunction, $\Gamma_s(x,x',t)$, %
we obtain the conditional probability for an electron to be at the position $x$ while having a hole at $x'$ (see SM Sec. I \cite{SM}). 
The first moment of the exciton wavefunction~\cite{man2021experimental, dong2021direct}
\begin{equation}
 m = \left. \int dx \abs{x} \abs{\Gamma_s (x,0,t)}^2 \middle/  \int dx \abs{\Gamma_s (x,0,t)}^2 \right. \,, \label{eq:1}
\end{equation}
reveals the degree of localization of an excitation (in this case around $x' = 0$), and therefore  can in principle allow us to  distinguish between bound excitons and free carriers. Indeed, if the material contains strongly-bound excitons, $m$ is small since the electron is very likely to remain near its hole. Note that $m$ is used to define the exciton radius from \textit{ab initio} simulation \cite{Prete2020}. Inversely, if a material contains free carriers and conduction bands are dispersive, then electrons are delocalized throughout the crystal, and $m$ increases to the size of the crystal. 
Figure~\ref{fig:1} (a) reveals that while for band-gap resonant pumping we only generate free carriers, for exciton resonant pumping, $m$ attains smaller values suggesting appreciable population of excitons, as expected for resonant pumping~\cite{PhysRevB.37.941}. 
At low intensity, indicated by the blue area, we generate mostly bound excitons, as also shown by the exciton density [Fig.~\ref{fig:1}(c)]. For high intensity, indicated by the red area, the population of free-carriers clearly dominates the excitation. This is also visible from the exciton density [Figs.~\ref{fig:1}(d,e)].
Therefore we use $m$ to differentiate the nature of the excitation, and extract the number of excitons $N_\text{ex}$ and number of free carriers $N_\text{fc}$ for the various excited systems in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}~(f), see SM Sec.~I~\cite{SM}. 
We observe that the generation of excitons by the $\omega_\text{ex}$-pump deviates from the first-order perturbative response, indicated by the dashed blue line. This deviation can be attributed to a subsequent exciton dissociation process occurring during the pumping, as the pump ionize the excitons it creates. This is confirmed by the ionization for a bound exciton model within the effective mass approximation, see SM Sec.~II \cite{SM}. Alternative mechanisms, such as nonlinear effects associated with three-photon excitations directly to the bandgap are excluded as this would reflect in a change of the slope of the power-law in Fig.~\ref{fig:1}~(f). On the contrary, the $\omega_\text{bg}$-pumped systems prepare dominantly free carriers at all intensities and follow the perturbative scaling. %
We note that the difference in the excitation magnitudes for the two pump frequencies in Figs.~\ref{fig:1}(c)-(f) can be rationalized from the relative resonance magnitudes in the linear absorption spectra, see SM Fig.~2~\cite{SM}. 
 In a pump-probe setting, the pump intensity for the exciton transition needs to be selected with care, to not dissociate them with the pump itself.

We now investigate the effect of a finite exciton population on the HHG spectra, by performing simulations where the material is excited by an exciton-resonant pump compared to the unpumped material. Differences between the considered cases (unpumped, band-gap resonant pumping and exciton-resonant pumping) start to emerge when the pump excites more than $10^{-5}$ valence electrons per unit cell, see SM Sec.~III~\cite{SM}.
To investigate the signatures of exciton dynamics in HHG, we perform a time-frequency analysis, see Fig.~\ref{fig:3} of the harmonic emission %
comparing the exciton-resonant pump case, to the unpumped case. 
Above the bandgap [Figs.~\ref{fig:3} (a)-(b)], the time-frequency analysis reveals that the exciton-seeded system is starting to emit harmonics prior to the unpumped sample. The initial emission time, at $75$ fs in Fig.~\ref{fig:3} (a) correspond to the time where substantial exciton dissociation is observed, see SM Fig.~6~\cite{SM}, indicating that ionization of excitons are primarily responsible for the early stage of the harmonic emission.
Indeed, the dissociate of exciton requires a weaker field strength than the excitation of electrons through the bandgap given the large binding energy of our system. The two-step process in which an exciton is generated and afterwards dissociated could thus play a dominant role.
Based on our results, we note that pumping excitons in the sample looks favorable with regard to decreasing the nonlinear response time of a condensed-matter system compared to an unpumped system. Similarly, pumping excitons in the sample also looks favorable for enhancing interband emission, see  SM Sec.~IV~\cite{SM}.

Commonly, the time-frequency analysis of the harmonic emission in solids consists of two contributions, a chirped emission related to the interband emission channel, and a chirpless emission due to the intraband motion of the electrons~\cite{PhysRevB.107.054302}. However, we observe not one set of chirped trajectories, but two, as shown more clearly in Fig.~\ref{fig:3}~(c)-(d). The standard approach to explain the chirped trajectories is to use a semiclassical interband model that propagates the relative electron-hole distance $\Delta x(t)$ as predicted by the band dispersion $\varepsilon_{j}\left(k(t')\right)$ of the valence and conduction bands ($j\in  \{v,c \}$) with 
\begin{equation}
\Delta x(t) = \int_{t_0}^t \pdv{\left[\varepsilon_{c}\left(k(t')\right) - \varepsilon_{v}\left(k(t') \right) \right]}{k} dt'\,,\nonumber
\end{equation}
where $t_0$ plays the role of the ionization time, see SM Sec.~V~\cite{SM}.
The recombination time $t_r$ is then conditioned by $\Delta x(t_r) = 0$ (i.e. neglecting imperfect recombination discussed in Ref.~\cite{PhysRevLett.124.153204,PhysRevA.95.043416,PhysRevA.102.033105}). This leads to an emission of light at the separation energy $\varepsilon_{c}\left[k\left(t_r\right)\right] - \varepsilon_{v}\left[k\left(t_r\right)\right]$. Using this model, we find the emission pattern shown by the black dots in Fig.~\ref{fig:3} (c)-(d). \\

Here we extended this semiclassical model in order to explain the other set of trajectories.
More precisely, we modify the recombination step to allow recombination into an exciton with binding energy $E_b$ with emission of $\varepsilon_{c}\left[k\left(t_r\right)\right] - E_b$. This leads to the emission pattern shown by the blue dots.
This recombination channel captures the second set of trajectories, thus revealing the importance of exciton recombination in the subcycle nonlinear electron dynamics. Since the energy goes into the formation of the exciton, the resulting harmonic emission energy is reduced, and the trajectories do not affect the high-energy part of the spectrum nor the energy cutoff.
We note that dissociation of excitons can also impact the ionization step of the semiclassical model. However, this leads to the same trajectories as the formation of free carriers when pumping electrons directly to the CBs. We cannot therefore distinguish signatures of exciton dissociation directly from the trajectories or energy cutoff. 
Apart from the new set of exciton-related trajectories, our simulations also reveal the appearance of exciton-related features in the below-bandgap energies, as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:3} (e) and (f). 
For the unpumped system [Fig.~\ref{fig:3} (e)], a continuous emission of clean odd-order harmonics is observed, %
as well as a resonance corresponding to the energy for generating or annihilating an exciton, as also observed in Ref.~\cite{PhysRevA.98.023415}. This is the expected subcycle dynamics for intraband emission~\cite{PhysRevLett.118.087403}. For the exciton-seeded system [Fig.~\ref{fig:3} (f)] we see that the exciton resonance is enhanced throughout and leads to continuous emission of weaker spectral features, corresponding to sidebands of the exciton resonance, located at $\omega_\mathrm{\mathrm{ex}} \pm 2 \omega$. %
Such sidebands occur as a consequence of the prepared population of excitons being driven by the probe pulse to annihilate. In doing so, the partly dissociated excitons can undergo a laser-assisted electron-hole recollision process where photons can be exchanged with the strong electromagnetic field \cite{Langer2016,Zaks2012}. Opposed to these THz excitonic sideband experiments, here we predict sideband generation, where energies above $1$\,eV are exchanged with the electromagnetic field. For these quasiparticle collisions to occur, the sample needs a significant population of excitons. We note from that the exciton resonance and sidebands are shifted slightly in energy, with increasing probe intensity, see SM Sec.~VI~\cite{SM}.

To utilize the spectroscopic capabilities of the harmonic exciton resonance and sidebands, we consider the harmonic emission spectra in Figs.~\ref{fig:2} (a)-(c) for a system driven with a $1600$, $2000$ or $2600$ nm probe pulse using an intensity of $10^7$ W cm$^{-2}$ and probe duration of 100\,fs.
All our simulations showed exciton-induced sidebands, irrespective of probe duration and intensity.
The signals from the unexcited system are given by the black curves and provide clean harmonic peaks with the inclusion of an exciton resonance at $\omega_{\mathrm{ex}}$. For the exciton-seeded system, the bound-exciton population contributes to an enhancement of the harmonic spectrum at the exciton energy, and its spectral sidebands in the regions marked with blue and green. This result shows that the sidebands can be observed over a laser range of wavelengths and are a robust feature of HHG from exciton-pump materials. %
Using our simulated pump-probe set-up, we now vary the exciton population by varying the pump intensity, and we track how the exciton resonance and sidebands are enhanced %
when increasing the exciton population.
We find that the exciton peak and the sidebands follow the same power law $N_\mathrm{ex}^{0.92}$ (see dashed lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:2}~(d)), confirming their common origin. This scaling deviates from the expected linear scaling, indicating that other processes such as probe-induced exciton dissociation are taking place during the probe pulse. We note that at high degree of exciton preparation, $\pm4\omega$ sidebands start to emerge in the HHG spectra but the associated enhancement is too low to be properly analyzed. Importantly, the direct relation between the population of bound excitons and the spectral weight of the exciton peak and sidebands opens the doors to ultrafast all-optical method of probing of exciton population. We also note that longer wavelengths seem to produce more intense exciton peaks and sidebands. It is therefore interesting to employ longer wavelengths to probe excitonic signatures.

In summary, we investigated how a prepared population of strongly bound excitons affect HHG in a one-dimensional solid, by modelling a pump-probe setup, thus getting insight into ultrafast exciton dynamics and revealed effects due to exciton dissociation and recombination. 
The behavior of exciton preparation under an intense pump was studied, revealing that the pump can dissociate the excitons it is creating, leading to more free carriers than excitons when the pump reaches high intensities.
The spectral features were found to be two fold: the presence of an exciton level allow for new excitation and recombination pathways. To reveal this, we developed an exciton-extended semiclassical interband model, from which we could explain how the carriers recombine into bound excitons. In addition, we observed how the presence of a finite population of bound excitons is able to enhance the HHG process in the region of the excitonic resonance, in particular leading to excitonic sidebands whose intensity was found to be close to proportional to the exciton population. 
We finally proposed HHG spectroscopy as a viable method of extracting information regarding a finite exciton population and exciton processes in solids exhibiting strongly bound excitons. The emergence of sensitive on-chip techniques for PHz-scale optical-field sampling provide experimental possibilities to temporally unravel such ultrafast light-driven exciton dynamics  \cite{PhysRevB.107.054302}.
There are still interesting  questions to be addressed. While we have investigated strongly-bound excitons, the role of continuum excitons as observed in semiconductors, carrier-induced screening, exciton-exciton interaction and dimensionality remains to be explored.
