  "abstract": "We explore the nonlinear response of ultrafast strong-field driven excitons in a one-dimensional solid with ab initio simulations. We demonstrate from our simulations and analytical model that a finite population of excitons imprints unique signatures to the high-harmonic spectra of materials. We show the exciton population can be retrieved from the spectra. We further demonstrate signatures of exciton recombination and that a shift of the exciton level is imprinted into the harmonic signal. The results open the door to high-harmonic spectroscopy of excitons in condensed-matter systems.",
