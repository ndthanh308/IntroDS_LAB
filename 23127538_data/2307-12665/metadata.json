  "abstract": "In this paper we consider stochastic thin-film equation with nonlinear drift terms, colored Gaussian Stratonovych noise, as well as nonlinear colored Wiener noise. By means of Trotter-Kato-type decomposition into deterministic and stochastic parts, we couple both of these dynamics via a discrete-in-time scheme, and establish its convergence to a non-negative weak martingale solution.",
