\section{Abstract }
%We present for the first time a group that generalizes
First time, we introduce Extended special linear group $ESL_2(\mathbb{F})$, which is generalization of the matrix group $SL_2(\mathbb{F})$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is arbitrary perfect field.
%over perfect field $k$. %where $k$ is arbitrary perfect field.
Extended special linear group $ESL_2(\mathbb{F})$ is storage of all square matrix roots from $ESL_2(\mathbb{F})$.

The analytical formula of square roots of 2-nd and 4-th power in $ SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$, $ ESL_2({\mathbb{F}_p})$, for any prime $p$,  as well as in $ SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$,  $ ESL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and in $ SL_2({k}), \\ ESL_2({k})$, over perfect field $k$, is found by us.


New linear group which is storage of square roots from $ SL_2({\mathbb{F}_p})$ is found and investigated by us.


The criterion of roots existing for different classes of matrix --- simple and semisimple matrixes from $ SL_2({\mathbb{F}_p})$, $ SL_2({\mathbb{Z}})$ are established.

The analytic formula of cubic square from matrix is founded.

The problems of square root from group element existing in  $SL_2(F_p)$, $SL_2(F_p)$ and $GL_2(F_p)$ for arbitrary prime $p$ are solved in this paper. The similar goal of root finding was reached in the GM algorithm adjoining an $n$-th root of a generator \cite{GM}
results in a discrete group
 for group $SL(2,R)$, but we consider this question over finite field $F_p$. Well known the Cayley-Hamilton method \cite{Pell} for computing the square roots of the matrix $M^n$ can give answer of square roots existing over a finite field only after computation of $det M^n$ and some real Pell-Lucas numbers by using Bine formula. Over method gives answer about existing $\sqrt{ M^n}$ without exponenting $M$ to $n$-th power. We only use the trace of $M$ or only eigenvalues of $M$.


In \cite{Amit} only the Anisotropic case of  group  $SL_1(\mathbb{Q})$,  where $\mathbb{Q}$ is a quaternion division algebra over $k$  was considered. The authors of \cite{Amit} considered criterion to be square only for the case $F_p$ is a field of characteristics not equal 2. We solve this problem even for fields $F_2$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$. The criterion to $g \in SL_2 (\mathbb{F}_2)$ be square in $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_2)$ was not found by them what was declared in a separate sentence in \cite{Amit}.
Also in \cite{Amit} the split case of $SL_2(k)$ and its powers was considered, where under group splitting authors mean Bruhat decomposition is the double coset decomposition of the group $SL_2(k)$ with respect to the subgroup Borel $B$, consisting of upper triangualar matrix from $SL_2(k)$.
Moreover authors of \cite{Amit}  find recursive formula of matrix root in $SL_2(k)$ only for case of field $char(k) \neq 2$ , but our formula solves this problem for a  $\mathbb{F}_p$ with arbitrary characteristic. Futhermore, our formula is analytical and does not require sequential recursive calculation.

We consider a more general case \cite{SkSq} consisting in the whole group $G= SL_2(F_q)$. We do not  provide additional condition of  splitting.  Also the authors considered separetely conjugacy classes in $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q )$  \cite{Amit}  such as:  central classes, split regular semisimple classes, non-semisimple classes, anisotropic regular semisimple classes. For each case the criterion of solvability of equation is provided. In the last two cases Bruhat decomposition is applied.
Our criterion oriented on more general class of matrix depending of the form of minimal and characteristic polynomials.


The necessary and sufficient conditions when an element of one the following matrix groups $GL_2(F_p)$, $SL_2(F_p)$ as well  as $ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ can be presented as a squares of one element from initial group are also found by us.


%Some necessary conditions to an element $g\in A_n$ being the square in $A_n$ are investigated. The criterion square root of an %element existing in $PSL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is found. The criterion of  existing an element square root in $PSL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ %is found.

We investigate a condition of a matrix quadraticity depending on its Jordan structure and spectrum.

%Sufficient and necessary conditions for the quadraticity of an element represented in the generating set $T$  in the group $S_n$ %and for a certain class of elements represented in the generating set $ M$ in the group $A_n$ are found.

\section{Introduction }

We research the conditions of matrix equation solvability $X^2= A$ in $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p), \\ GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ and one of splitting extension of $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ that is $ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$  \cite{SkSq, Square}. %New matrix group $ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is presented.

Our statements  can be easy reformulated for these groups over the field $\mathbb{R}$ so it lead us to arguments of solving of discreteness problem \cite{GM, GM1} in some subgroups of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$.

One method of computing square roots of two-by-two matrices was presented in
\cite{Sull} but under unsolved by him condition which $\sqrt{A}$ exists. But we find not only all such conditions but the method of square root computation for $n \times n$ matrix. Moreover we consider this question in groups over finite fields. Also we indicate in which group $\sqrt{A}$ lies.

%The width of a verbal subgroup $ V (G,\,W)$ \cite{Kag } over a set $W$ % Lynd, Sar
%is equal to a least value $m\in \mathbb{N}\cup \{\infty \}$ such that every element from $V\left(G , W\right)$ can be %represented as the  product of at most $m$ values of words from $W$.



The action of subgroup of new group $ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ introduced here also arose without description of group structure and generators in the topology.
Namely, if $G$ is a Morse-Bott foliation on the solid Klein bottle K into 2-dimensional Klein bottles parallel to the boundary and one singular circle $S^1$ then such group appears as leaf preserving diffeomorphisms for foliations $G$  \cite{MaksB}.


In many geometrical groups there are automorphisms preserve hyperbolic distance (hyperbolic metric) and hyperbolic angles, furthermore they may change orientation of space as well as keep it permanent \cite{Steinberg}.

In hyperbolic geometry there are groups in particular group projective special linear group preserves hyperbolic length \cite{Khan} and orientation as well as change orientation. As well known $S{{L}_{2}}(R)$ possess such a property too, but action of $S{{L}_{2}}(R)$ is non-faithful because of $PSL_2(R)$ is a homomorphic image of $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$.


Define the algebraic properties and structures in the following item.







%The Verbal  Width of a free group was investigated by Sucharit Sarkar \cite{Sar}. He proved that an arbitrary commutator of free %group of rank greater than 1 cannot be generated by only 2 squares. The conditions when a commutator can be presented as a %product of 2 squares were further found by Sarkar too \cite{Sar}.

One of interesting algorithmic problem of combinatorial group theory was solved by Roman'kov \cite{Rom}.
 It was problem of determining for any element $g\in G$ is $g$ a commutator for free nilpotent group $N_r$ of arbitrary rank $r$ with class of nilpotency 2 \cite{Rom}.
The analogous problem can be formulated for  $SL_n(F_q)$, $GL_n(F_q)$ and $ESL_n(F_q)$ over a set of squares.

%The problem of the solvability of an equation over a group is well known. We consider a more difficult problem on the %solvability of an equation of the form in a group.

The problem of the solvability of an equation over a group is well known. We consider the same problem with additional constrains on the solvability of an equation of the form $X^2=A$  in a group.

Question of root existing in different forms appears in the Purtzitsky-Rosenberger trace minimizing algorithm \cite{Purtz, GM} it was considered roots and rational powers of one or both generators of    in non-elementary two generator
discrete subgroups of $PSL_2(R)$ found by the GM algorithm. But we solve existing root problem for arbitrary element of $PSL_2(F_p)$.

Also such criterion of root existing for $SL_2(F_p)$, $PSL_2(F_p)$ and $GL_2(F_p)$ are established.
This criterion is a stricter version of the formulated question for group extensions how large must an overgroup of a given group be in order to contain a square root of any element of the initial group $G$, which was considered in the paper of Anton A. Klyachko and D. V. Baranov \cite{Klyach}.





 The main result of this paper about criterion of quadraticity can be extended to larger dimension matrices having a Jordan structure constructed of blocks of dimension 2 or 1. Also, our result for a semisimple matrix of dimension 2 can be generalized to a semisimple matrix of higher dimension.

Since $PSL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$, $p>3$ is simple and is quotient-subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ then study of verbal subgroup generated by squares in $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ gives possibility to study Waring problem for matrices over finite
fields \cite{Waring}.




%Our result can be extended for a samisimple matrices of grater size having a Jordan structure consructed of blocks of dimension %2 or 1. Also, our result for a semisimple matrix of dimension 2 can be generalized to a semisimple matrix of higher dimension.

%Introduction
%Through the ubiquity of group actions and the concrete representations which they afford, both finite and infinite permutation groups arise in many parts of mathematics and %continue to be a lively topic of research in their own right. It then develops the combinatorial and group theoretic structure of primitive groups leading to the proof of %the pivotal O'Nan-Scott Theorem which links finite primitive groups with finite simple groups.\\

\section{Preliminaries }

In hyperbolic geometry there are groups in particular projective special linear group preserves hyperbolic length \cite{Khan} and orientation as well as changes orientation. As well known $S{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{R})$ that possess such a property too besides besides property of changing orientation, because of action of $S{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{R})$ is non-faithful because of $PSL_2(R)$ is a homomorphic image of $SL_2(R)$. A proposed by us group $ES{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{R})$ also  preserves hyperbolic length \cite{Khan} and orientation as well as changes space orientation.


 % Отсюда сделано перенос
An action of a subgroup of $ ESL_2(R)$ appears in leaf preserving diffeomorphism group which is called
foliated  leaf preserving in Morse-Bott foliation on the solid torus \cite{MaksTor} of simplest Morse-Bott foliations.
But this action was defined geometrically by symmetry with respect to meridian and parallel of torus and infinite shift on torus.



% Тут мы исправили это можно переставить в Прилиминариез или просто оставить.
Also Morse-Bott foliation on solid torus \cite{MaksTor} $T = S^{-1} \times D^2$ into 2- tori parallel to the boundary and one singular circle consists of elements presented by matrices with determinant 1 and -1 by author who characterize it as a subgroup of the whole $GL_2(R)$ group. But now we characterize it more precisely as a subgroup of smaller group $ESL_2(R)<GL_2(R)$. The diffeomorphisms group of this manifold  posses the subgroup  $\mathcal{G}$ described in the geometrical terms,  where the actions of shifts, symmetries relative to a parallel and symmetries relative to a meridian appear, where shift is generated by $\left(\begin{array}{rr}
   1\,\,&0 \\
  1 \,\,&1
\end{array} \right)$ which is called by reflection.
%The actions by symmetries relative to a parallel and symmetries relative to a meridian emerge. % Also shift in $\mathcal{G}$ is defined by $\left(\begin{array}{rr}
 %  1\,\,&0 \\
 % 1 \,\,&1
% \end{array} \right)$,
Symmetries relative to a parallel and a meridian are defined by matrices $\left(\begin{array}{rr}
   1\, &0 \\
  0 \, &-1
\end{array} \right), \ \
\left(\begin{array}{rr}
   -1\,\,&0 \\
  0 \,\,&1
\end{array} \right)$ correspondingly.
This actions generate group $\mathcal{G}$ which is a proper subgroup of $ESL_2(Z)$.

Define the algebraic properties and structures of $ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ in the next item.

\textbf{\bf Definition 1.}
{\sl The set of matrices \[\left\{ {{M}_{i}}:Det({{M}_{i}})=\pm 1,  {M}_{i} \in GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p) \right\} \] forms \textbf{extended special linear group}  in $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ and is denoted by  $\texttt{ESL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$.


As it is studied by us, $ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)\cong SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)\rtimes \,{{\mathcal{C}}_{2}}$, where $\,{{\mathcal{C}}_{2}}$ is generated by reflection $\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)$. The involution from $\,{{\mathcal{C}}_{2}} \simeq   \left\langle \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right) \right\rangle  $ induces the sign of automorphism in $Aut\left( SL_2(F_p) \right)$. Matrices  with determinant -1 correspond to the elements changing Euclidean space orientation.
As it was found in our study of the roots of matrices from group matrices from defined above group $ESL_2(F_p)$ arise.
}
 Justification of $ SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p),  SL_2(\mathbb{Z}),  SL_2(\mathbb{Q}),  SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ extensions existence based on  the description $Aut\left( SL_2((\mathbb{F}_p) \right), Aut\left( SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \right), \ldots,  \\ Aut\left(SL_2(\mathbb{R})\right)$ and its subgroups of order 2.
 We can spread the definition of $ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ on case of
  matrices over the arbitrary field
 $\mathbb{F}$ as well as over the ring $\mathbb{Z}$. In similar way we can extend $ SL_n(\mathbb{F}_p)$ to $ ESL_n (\mathbb{F}_p)$.

$SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ is subgroup of index 2 in $ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ so its normality is established.

The existence of a non-trivial homomorphism $\varphi :\,\,{{\mathbb{Z}}_{2}}\to Aut\left( S{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{Z}) \right)$, as well as $\phi :\,\,{{\mathbb{Z}}_{2}}\to Aut\left( S{{L}_{2}}({{\mathbb{F}}_{p}}) \right)$ and $\phi :\,\,{{\mathbb{Z}}_{2}}\to Aut\left( S{{L}_{2}}({{\mathbb{F}}_{p}}) \right)$, can be proved by indicating an element of order 2 in the automorphisms of base group that is the kernel of the semidirect product we want to construct.
There is countergradient automorphism in $S{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{Z} \right)$ that is $\varphi :\,M\to {{\left( {{M}^{T}} \right)}^{-1}}$ or alternating automorphism of order 2 acting by conjugating $\varphi :\,M\to D^{-1}MD$, where $D=\left( \begin{array}{rr}
   1\,\,\, &0 \\
  0\,\, & -1 \\
\end{array} \right)$ and is called by diagonal automorphism \cite{Mersl}.



 $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ is a normal subgroup of $ESL_2(\mathbb{Z})$, as being the kernel of the determinant, which is a group homomorphism whose image is the multiplicative group $ \{-1, +1 \}$.

\begin{rem} It is obvious that orthogonal group $O_2(k) < ESL_2(k)$, where $k$ is a field but $O_2(k) \ntriangleleft  ESL_2(k)$ \cite{Linear, LinearShpringer}.
\end{rem}
In fact, the action by conjugation of elements from the $ESL_2(k)$ does not preserve angles and does not fixe non-degenerate quadratic and Hermitian forms.

We briefly introduce the minimal set of generators and new relations in   $ESL_2\left( \mathbb{Z} \right)$ \cite{AutSLp} i.e. this group over  integer ring. Each relation of $SL_2\left( \,Z \right)$ holds.
We denote
$\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)$
  by $s$ and
  $\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -1 \\
1 &  0 \\
\end{array}
\right)$
    as $t$  they generate $SL_2\left( \mathbb{Z} \right)$, new generator
$\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)$
is denoted by $i$.  Then new relation is
${{i}^{-1}}si=s$.
Note that elements $i$ and $t$ are orthogonal because of $ti=0$. Some interesting relation in this terms of the kernel subgroup $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ are ${{t}^{2}}=-E$,  ${{t}^{-2}}s{{t}^{2}}=s$.

Existence justification of such extension of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ by $C_2$  is based on $Aut(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))$ \cite{Mart, Mersl, Gur} structure which is splitting  extension $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$  by $\mathbb{Z}$.
As well known the group of outer automorphisms of $S{{L}_{n}}(\mathbb{Z})$ is semidirect products of the form  $S{{L}_{n}}(\mathbb{Z}){{\rtimes }_{\varphi }}\mathbb{Z}$  and its isomorphism type depends only on  $[\varphi ]\in Out(S{{L}_{n}}(\mathbb{Z}))$.  Since $Aut(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))$ contains an element of order 2 that is $t^2$  therefore homomorphism from top group that is cyclic group $C_2 = <i>$ of order 2  in $Aut(SL_2(\mathbb{Z}))$ exists.

The action by right multiplication on  $\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
\right)$ of  matrix from  $S{{L}_{n}}(\mathbb{Z})$ inducing automorphism changing sing (inverting sing) of first column of matrix $A$ from $S{{L}_{n}}(\mathbb{Z})$.  This  automorphism invert sign of $det(A)$.

The concept of geometrical group $\mathcal{G}$ appears as subgroup in the group ${{D}^{lp}}\left( F \right)$  of diffeomorphisms group of $T$ and  $\left[ 0;\text{ }1 \right]$ on ${{C}^{\infty }}(T,\left[ 0;\text{ }1 \right])$ and now is characterized by us in more structural way and exact in algebraic sense, because of the authors \cite{MaksTor} consider the following subgroup $\mathcal{G}$ as subgroup of very wide group $GL(2, \mathbb{Z})$ consisting of matrices for which the vector $(0, 1)$ is eigen with eigenvalue $±1$.  Which was defined as:
$$\mathcal{G}=\,\left\{ \,\left( \begin{array}{rr}
   \varepsilon \,\,&0 \\
  m\,\, & \delta
\end{array} \right)\left| m\in \mathbb{Z},\,\,\,\varepsilon ,\delta \in \left\{ \pm 1 \right\} \right. \right\}.$$

%$$\mathcal{G}=\,\left\{ \,\left( \begin{align}{rr}
%  & \varepsilon \,\,\,0 \\
% & m\,\,\delta  \\
%\end{align} \right)\left| m\in \mathbb{Z},\,\,\,\varepsilon ,\delta \in \left\{ \pm 1 \right\} \right. \right\}.$$



But $\mathcal{G}$ is a proper subgroup of $ESL_2(\mathbb{Z)}$ that is more special whole $G{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{Z} \right)$  Moreover $ES{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{Z} \right)$ has as kernel a proper subgroup of $S{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{Z} \right)$, because of  $det\left( \mathcal{G} \right)=\pm 1$.
Furthermore the concept of new group  $ES{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{Z} \right)$ admits us to obtain a structural characterization and set of generators with relations for $\mathcal{G}$.
Furthermore $ES{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{Z} \right)$ give us structural characterization and set of generators with relations for $\mathcal{G}$.
We take in consideration involutions which generate symmetry of torus symmetries with respect to the parallel are represented by matrix
 $t=\left(\begin{array}{rr}
   1\,\,&0 \\
  0 \,\,&-1
\end{array} \right)$ and generator of this subgroup of $ES{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{Z} \right)$ top group $i=\left(\begin{array}{rr}
  -1\,\,\,&0 \\
  0 \,\,\,&1
\end{array} \right)$ which is also is symmetries with respect to the meridian of the torus in paper \cite{MaksTor}.
Now using concept of new group $ESL_2(\mathbb{Z)}$ allows us to give exact and structural characterization of group $\mathcal{G}$ which contains in ${{D}^{lp}}\left( F \right)$. For this goal we consider subgroup of $ESL_2(\mathbb{Z)}$ with kernel $K\simeq \left\langle \left( \begin{array}{rr}
   1\,\,\,&0 \\
  1\,\,\,\,&1 \\
\end{array} \right) \right\rangle$. Since $K\simeq \left\langle \left( \begin{array}{rr}
   \,1\,\,\, & 0 \\
  \,1\,\,\, & 1
\end{array} \right) \right\rangle \simeq \mathbb{Z}$  then $AutK\simeq {{\mathbb{Z}}_{2}}$ and therefore homomorphism from subgroup $~\left\langle i \right\rangle $ as well as from  subgroup $\left\langle t \right\rangle $ to $AutK$ exist. One easy can check that

$i
\left(
\begin{array}{rr}
1\ & 0 \\
1\ & 1
\end{array}
\right)
i^{-1}=
\left(
\begin{array}{rr}
1\ & 0 \\
-1\ & 1
\end{array}
\right)
=
\left(
\begin{array}{rr}
1\ & 0 \\
1\ & 1
\end{array}
\right)
^{-1}
$
%$$=\left( \begin{align}
%  & \,\,\,\,\,1\,\,\,\,0 \\
% & \,-1\,\,\,\,\,1 \\
%\end{align} \right)={{\left( \begin{align}
%  & \,1\,\,\,\,0 \\
% & \,1\,\,\,\,\,1 \\
%\end{align} \right)}^{-1}}$
and rest of conjugations remain $K$ invariant.
Thus, we find a structure of $\mathcal{G}$ which, up to a way to define a semidirect product, is $\mathcal{G}\,\simeq K\ltimes \left\langle t,i \right\rangle $.
 An important fact that $K\ltimes \left\langle t,i \right\rangle $
  is a subgroup  in $ES{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{Z})$. Top subgroup of $\mathcal{G}$ has 2 generators but kernel subgroup $K$ is one generated, unlike the  kernel in $ES{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{Z})$ having 2 generators. If we denote $\left( \begin{array}{rr}
   \,1\,\,\,& 0 \\
     \,1\,\,\,\,& 1
\end{array} \right)$  then the relations are following $isi={{s}^{-1}},\,\,tst={{s}^{-1}},\,\,\,{{t}^{2}}={{s}^{2}}=e$.

We denote by e.v. --- \textbf{eigenvalue}s.
%We denote minimal polynomial of a matrix $A$ by $µ_A$.
Let $\mu_A$ be minimal polynomial of $A$.


A polynomial $P(X)$ over a given field $K$ is separable if its roots are distinct in an algebraic closure of $K$, that is, the number of distinct roots is equal to the degree of the polynomial.
\emph{Simple matrix} is a matrix such that characterstic polynomial is separable.


Recall that matrix $A$ is
called \textbf{semisimple} if $\mu_A$ is a product of distinct monic irreducible and
separable polynomials; if moreover all these irreducible polynomials
have degree 1, then $A$  is called split semisimple or diagonalizable.


We denote iff --- necessary and sufficient condition, 
e,v.  --- eigenvalue.

Geometrical transformations corresponding to matrices that form the subgroup of the introduced here $S{{L}_{2}}\left( R \right) \rtimes {{C}_{2}} $ group, occur in leaf preserving diffeomorphism group in Morse-Bott foliation on the solid Klein bottle \cite{MaksB}, with the complementary circle, which are homeomorphisms.

%under consideration
Also an action defined in a geometrical form of subgroup over $\mathbb{R}$ of our group $S{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{R} \right) \rtimes {{C}_{2}} $ occurs in continuous transformations of the Klein bottle (because of matrix $A$ with $det(A) =-1$ change space orientation) with the complementary circle, which are homeomorphisms. Action of the subgroup such a group appears in  diffeomorphisms groups of simplest Morse-Bott foliations which were presented in geometrical and topological forms as shift and symmetries relatively meridian and parallel by S. I. Maksymenko.


Group of continuous functions implementing rotation $D\left( y \right)$, which is a linear isomorphism preserving concentric circles, simultaneously with a shift as standing a second coordinate of tuple, is presented in \cite{MaksB}. Its elements have a form of pair $(w{{e}^{2\pi i{{\lambda }_{h}}(s)}},s)$, where ${{\lambda }_{h}}(s)$ ensures sign inversion provided unit shift (on one).  We assume that this subgroup has structure of semidirect  product and denote it by $H$.
Thus, from this group $H$ of diffeomorphisms with additional functions
${{\lambda }_{h}}\left( s+1 \right)=-{{\lambda }_{h}}\left( s \right)$ making changing of sign provided by action of shift on one described in \cite{MaksB} homomorphism in subgroup of $ES{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{R})$ can be constructed.    Homomorphic image can be realized by matrices of rotation with sign inversion inducing by the top group of semidirect product $ES{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{R})$ that could be also generated by Frobenius normal form
$\left( \begin{array}{rr}
   0\,\, &-1 \\
  1\,\,\,\,& 0 \\
\end{array} \right)$.
Thus this subgroup of $ES{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{R})$ can be embedded in $H$ and this subgroup  is realized by matrices of rotation on with sign inversion due to the top group of semidirect product $ES{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{R})$.
In $H$ one of subgroup of our new group $ES{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{R})$  is embedded. This subgroup is
$ \left( SO(2) \right)  \ltimes \left\langle \left( \begin{array}{rr}
 -1\,\,\,& 0 \\
  0\,\,\, &1 \\
\end{array}  \right) \right\rangle  \simeq : O(2)  $.

%$\left\langle \left( \begin{array}{rr}

% -1\,\,\,& 0 \\
%  0\,\,\, &1 \\
%\end{array}  \right) \right\rangle = : \left\langle\rho \right\rangle\ltimes \left\langle i  \right\rangle $.



We denote this subgroup by $\left\langle\rho \right\rangle\ltimes \left\langle i  \right\rangle$. Note that group of the diffeomorphisms $h$ coinciding with some vector bundle morphism also function ${{\lambda }_{h}}:\,\,\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is described in \cite{MaksB}  in item 3), there are subgroup $h'(w,s)=\left( {{e}^{2\pi i{{\lambda }_{h}}(s)}},s \right),\,\,\,\,\,{{\lambda }_{h}}\left( s+1 \right)=-{{\lambda }_{h}}\left( s \right)$ presented in form of functions.  Additionally we can describe its structure as semidirect product. We establish a homomorphism from this group to $\left\langle\rho \right\rangle\ltimes \left\langle i  \right\rangle$.
    Furthermore the top group of $ES{{L}_{2}}(R)$ is the same matrix
$i= \left( \begin{array}{rr}
 -1\,\,\,& 0 \\
  0\,\,\, &1 \\
\end{array}  \right)$ coinciding with a matrix $\Lambda $ presenting the meridian of torus respect to the parallel \cite{MaksTor}.

Matrices of  $G{{L}_{2}}\text{ }\left( \mathbb{Z} \right)$ are present in subgroup $L_{p,q}$
of diffeomorphism denoted by $D\left( {{L}_{p,q}} \right)$ in \cite{MaksTor}, whence its group closure Is $ES{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{Z})$ but algebraic structure of set was not investigated before it was recalled as  subset of $G{{L}_{2}}\text{ }\left( \mathbb{Z} \right)$  with determinant -1 also there is transformation $T$  in that item with $\det (T)=1$. Thus there is such subgroup $ES{{L}_{2}}(\mathbb{Z})$ in nature but it was not defined and investigated as algebraic group before.























%The group is said to be \textbf{verbally simple} if it has no proper verbal
%subgroups.

%Considering multiplication of permutations
%we utilize composing from left  to right,  as seems to be the practice in
%introductory texts. However, granting the fact, the identity
%$(1 2 3 ...  k) = (1 k) ... (1 3)(1 2)$
%shows that that a $k$-cycle is even if and only if $k$ is odd.


%Recall the Carmichael generator set $\langle s_n, t \rangle$:
%$$
% s_n=\begin{cases}
%(1,2)(3, \ldots, n),&\text{ $n\equiv 0 (mod 2)$},\\
%(3,4, \ldots, n),     &\;\;\text{$n\equiv 1 (mod 2)$ }.\\
%\end{cases}
%$$
%As well known \cite{CONRAD, Carm, Carm2}, the set of $t=(1,2,3)$ and $s_n$ is generating set for $A_{n}$, $n>3$.

%We observe additional generating set of $A_n$ \cite{aviv} with 2 generators but which is not Carmichaecl
% generating set. In case of $n\equiv 1\left ( \bmod 2 \right)$ our generators are following:  $t=(1,2,3)$  and $s=(1,2,...,n)$, %for even  $n$ the generators have form of cycles $t=(1, 2, 3)$ and $s=(2,3, … ,n)$. Consequantly the cycles number  $cyc(s)$ %\cite{aviv} in the these generators $s, \, t$ are minimal.

% Following  Mitsuhashi's generating set is the nearest to Coxeter for $S_n$: $a_{ij}:= s_1s_{i} = (1,2)(i,i+1)$, $(2 \leq  i < j %\leq n-1)$ \cite{aviv}.

% As well known the set $T$ of transpositions  $T= \{(1,2); (2,3); ... (n-1, n)   \} $ is generating set of involutive type for %$S_n$.




%Let $G$ be a group and $W$ be a set of words.

%The verbal subgroup $V_W (G)$ of group $G$ is the subgroup generated by all

\section {Square root of an element in $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$, $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ and $ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$}

Let $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$  denotes the special  linear group of degree 2 over a finite field of order $p$. And a degree always means an irreducible character degree in this paper.

We recall the well known relation between eigenvalues of $A$ and $f(A)$.
\begin{lem}\label{eigenval}
If $\beta $ is an eigenvalue for $B$ then ${{\beta }^{2}}$ is an eigenvalue for ${{B}^{2}}$.
\end{lem}

Consider the criterion of squareness of elements in $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ as well as in $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ which can be presented by diagonal matrix. As well known \cite{LinearShpringer} a matrix can be presented in the diagonal form iff the algebraic multiplicity of its eigenvalues are the same  as the geometric multiplicity.
%We denote a faithful representation of $PSL_2(F_p)$ by %$\widehat{PSL_2(F_p)}$.


% Aa?ney n INE Let A a be simple matrix and
%$A \in \widehat{PSL_2(F_p)}$  \cite{Linear, LinearShpringer}, then
%for matrix $A \in PSL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ there is a solution  $B \in \widehat{PSL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)}$ of the matrix equation
% \begin{equation*}
%X^2 = A
%\end{equation*}
%if and only if at least one of

% \begin{equation}\label{tr}
% tr(A)+2,  \, \, tr(A)-2	
%\end{equation}

 % is a quadratic residue or $0$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$.



\begin{thm}\label{CriterionPSL}
Let $A$ be simple matrix and
$A \in SL_2(\mathbb{F})$  \cite{LinearShpringer}, then
for  $A $ there is a solution  $B \in SL_2(\mathbb{F})$ of the matrix equation
 \begin{equation}\label{Eq}
X^2 = A
\end{equation}
if and only if
\begin{equation}\label{tr}  {trA+2}
\end{equation}
%\left({trA+2}\right)

 is quadratic element in $\mathbb{F}$ or 0, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a field.

%\begin{equation}\label{tr}
%left(\frac{trA+2}{p}\right) \in \{0,1\}.
%\end{equation}


If  $X \in ESL_2(\mathbb{F})$ then the matrix equation  \eqref{Eq} has a solution in $ESL_2(\mathbb{F})$ iff

\begin{equation}\label{trESL}
{trA \pm 2}
\end{equation}

 is quadratic element in $\mathbb{F}$ or 0.

This solution $X \in ESL_2(\mathbb{F}) \setminus SL_2(\mathbb{F})$ iff $\left({tr A - 2}{}\right)$ is quadratic element or 0 in $\mathbb{F}$ but $\left({trA + 2}{}\right)$ is not. Conversely $X \in SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ iff $\left({trA + 2}{}\right)$ is quadratic element. Solutions $X_{i} \in ESL_2(\mathbb{F})$ and $SL_2(\mathbb{F})$ iff $\left({trA + 2}{}\right)$ and $\left({trA - 2}{}\right)$ are quadratic elements.




%\begin{equation}\label{trGL}
%\left(\frac{trA \pm 2}{p}\right) \in \{0,1\}.
%\end{equation}

In the case $A \in GL_2 ({{\mathbb{F}}_{}})$ this condition \eqref{tr} takes form:
\begin{equation}\label{trGL}
 {trA \pm 2\sqrt{detA}}
\end{equation}
 is quadratic element in $\mathbb{F}$ or 0.



%In the case  $A \in GL_2 ({{\mathbb{F}}_{p}})$ this condition \eqref{tr} takes form:
% \begin{equation} \label{trGL}
%\left(\frac{trA \pm 2\sqrt{detA}}{p} \right) \in \{0,1\}.
% \end{equation}

\end{thm}





\begin{proof}
Throughout the proof a quadraticity of element $x$ or $x=0$ in a field $\mathbb{F}$ be denoted by $\left(\frac{x}{p}\right) \in \{0,1\}$. For concretization, we provide a proof over $\mathbb{F}p$.
But out prove can be spread without changes on \emph{arbitrary field} $\mathbb{F}$ instead $\mathbb{F}_p$.

We assume that matrices $A$ and $B$ have eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 $ and $\mu_1, \mu_2 $ respectively.
%have already been reduced to a Jordan normal form.
Let a characteristic polynomial ${{\chi }_{B}}(x)$ of $B$ be the following: ${{\chi }_{B}}(x) = (x - \mu_1)(x - \mu_2)$. We denote $tr(A)$ by $a$.


 Then according to Lemma \ref{eigenval} $a$ is the sum of the roots $\mu_1^2$, $\mu_2^2$ of a polynomial ${{\chi }_{A}}(x)=(x-\mu_1^2)(x-\mu_2^2)$. Therefore $tr(A)= a = \mu_1^2 + \mu_2^2 = (\mu_1 + \mu_2)^2 - 2\mu_1\mu_2 = (tr(B))^2-2$. Since  $det(A),  A \in PSL_n(F_p)$ is 1, then eigenvalues of $A$ satisfy the following equality: $\mu_1^2\mu_2^2 = 1 $ that implies $\mu_1\mu_2 = \pm 1$. Therefore $a + 2\mu_1\mu_2 = a \pm2 = (\mu_1+\mu_2)^2$. As is known $tr(B)=\mu_1+\mu_2 \in  F_p$ and $det(B)=\mu_1 \mu_2 \in F_p$.

 %As well known a trace and determinant of matrix $B$ belong to $F_p$. Therefore $\mu_1 + \mu_2 \in F_p$ and $\mu_1 \mu_2 \in  %F_p$.


We show the existence of ${{\chi }_{B}}(x):={{x}^{2}}-cx+1$ having roots ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$ which will be the e.v. of $B$.
%We prove the existence of ${{\chi }_{B}}(x):={{x}^{2}}-cx+1$ who's roots are e.v. ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$  of $B$.
Let ${{\chi }_{{{B}^{2}}}}(x)={{\mu }^{2}}-a\mu +1$. Then $\mu _{1}^{2},\,\,\,\mu _{2}^{2}$ are e.v. for $A$ and according to Viet's theorem, $\mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2}=a.$

Let us prove the sufficiency of the condition $(\frac{trA+2}{p})=1$.  We take into account Lemma \ref{eigenval} whence $\mu _{1}^{2},\,\,\,\mu _{2}^{2}$ are e.v. of $A$, provided ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$ are e.v. of $B$.
Since $\left(\frac{tr(A)+2}{p}\right) \in \{0, 1\}$, then
there exists such  $c\in {{F}_{p}}$  for which  ${{c}^{2}}=tr(A)+2$. For such $c$ we get, that the roots  ${{\mu }_{1}},{{\mu }_{2}}$  of the polynomial  ${{x}^{2}}-cx+1$ satisfy the following property:  $\mu _{1}^{2}$  and $\mu _{2}^{2}$  are equal to e.v. of $A$.  Hence any matrix $B$ with  $tr(B)=c$  and  $\det (B)=1$ satisfies the property: ${{B}^{2}}$ has the same e.v. as $A$.

%INSERTED  FROM DRAFT
%(PROOF OF EXISTING OF SOLUTION IN SL(F)).


Also $c= \mu _{1}+ \mu _{2} = tr(B)$. Thus matrix $B$ is in $SL_2(F_p)$.



% and the fact following from Lemma \ref{eigenval} that $\mu _{1}^{2},\,\,\,\mu _{2}^{2}$ are e.v. of  $A$  yield that there are  %${{\chi }_{B}}(x)$ over ${{\text{F}}_{\text{p}}}$  with roots  ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$.

%Aaeaa noa?ue aa?eaio
%Let us prove that the condition $(\frac{trA+2}{p})=1$ and the fact following from Lemma \ref{eigenval} that $\mu %_{1}^{2},\,\,\,\mu _{2}^{2}$ are e.v. of  $A$  yield that there are  ${{\chi }_{B}}(x)$ over ${{\text{F}}_{\text{p}}}$  with %roots  ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$.



The condition $(\frac{trA+2}{p})=1$ is necessary and sufficient for existing a solution of ${{X}^{2}}=A$  in $S{{L}_{2}}({{\text{F}}_{p}})$. Let us construct the solution of equation $X^2=A$ in $SL_2(F_p)$. In general case we obtain the solution \[{{B}^{2}}=A',\] where $A'\sim A$ with eigenvalues ${{\lambda }_{1}}=\mu _{1}^{2},\,\,\,{{\lambda }_{2}}=\mu _{2}^{2}.$     Since $c \in {{\text{F}}_{p}}$ then we can construct in normal Frobenius form a matrix
\[\left( \begin{array}{rr}
  0\,\,& -1 \,  \\
  1\,\, &c \, \\
\end{array} \right)={{B}_{}}\]

 therefore this matrix is over base field ${{\text{F}}_{p}}$ or ${{\text{Q}}}$ or arbitrary field $\mathbb{F}$.
Since ${{\lambda }_{1}}+{{\lambda }_{2}}={{(\mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2})}^{2}}-2=trA$ and  that is why ${{\left( \mu _{1}^{{}}+\,\mu _{2}^{{}} \right)}^{2}}=trA+2$ this equality holds iff  $(\frac{trA+2}{p})=1$. Thus, the condition $(\frac{trA+2}{p})=1$ is  sufficient for existing of ${{\chi }_{b}}(x)$.
But it remains to show that these eigenvalues $\sqrt{\lambda_1}=\mu_1$, $\sqrt{\lambda_2}=\mu_2$ are the roots of the characteristic polynomial $\chi_B(x)$.



By the condition of theorem $trA+2$ is a quadratic residue or 0, there is $\sqrt{tr(A)+2}=\sqrt{{{({{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}})}^{2}}}$ in ${{\text{F}}_{\text{p}}}$, whence $tr(\text{B})\in {{\text{F}}_{\text{p}}},\,\,\det B\in {{\text{F}}_{\text{p}}}$ holds in view of well known theorems, therefore ${{\chi }_{B}}(x)$ has coefficients $c=\sqrt{tr(A)+2} = {\mu }_{1}+{\mu }_{2}$
 in ${{\text{F}}_{\text{p}}}$, hence $B$ presented in the Frobenius normal form belongs to $S{{L}_{2}}({{\text{F}}_{\text{p}}})$.

  Furthermore $B$  having  e.v.  ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$ is the matrix over ${{\text{F}}_{\text{p}}}$, but ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$ can be from ${{\text{F}}_{{{\text{p}}^{2}}}}\backslash {{\text{F}}_{\text{p}}}$.

For analyzing distributions of roots of \eqref{Eq} by cosets of $ES{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{F} \right)$ consider ${{\left( {{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}} \right)}^{2}}=\mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2}+2{{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}= tr(A) + 2 det(A)$. If we have   $\mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2}-2=tr(A)-2$ is square in $\mathbb{F}$, then $\det (A)={{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}=-1$ and so these roots of \eqref{Eq}  from coset $ES{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{F} \right)\backslash S{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{F} \right)$. If $\mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2}+2=trA+2$ is square in $\mathbb{F}$ then the roots of equation \eqref{Eq} are from normal subgroup $S{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{F} \right)$ from $ES{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{F} \right)$.



 At the same time we have relation $\mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2}={{\left( \mu _{1}^{{}}+\mu _{2}^{{}} \right)}^{2}}-2=tr(A)$.
	Consider characteristic polynomial ${{x}^{2}}-cx+1=0$, where $c={{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}}$. Show that it is exactly a characteristic polynomial for $B=\sqrt{A}$. Indeed e.v. of $B$ have to be ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$ and have to satisfy condition \ref{tr}.  Substitute ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$ in ${{x}^{2}}-cx+1=0$ we can verify that they are roots ${{x}^{2}}-({{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}})x+1={{\mu }_{1}}^{2}-({{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}}){{\mu }_{1}}+1=0-{{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}+1=0$ and the analogously for verification of ${{\mu }_{2}}$.


 We show the necessity of condition  \eqref{tr} provided the rest of the theorem conditions hold.
 We assume that there exists $B\in F_p$ such that $B^2=A$ and deduce the condition $\frac{trA+2}{p}=1$.
% So we assume that the required matrix $B$ exists.
  It provides existing of correspondent characteristic polynomial $\chi_B(x)=x^2+cx+1$, where by Viet theorem $c=\mu_1+\mu_2$ which in accord to equalities $\mu_1^2 = \lambda_1,   \mu_2^2 = \lambda_2$. In the same time $trA+2= {\mu_1 + \mu_2 }^2+2$. Since $B\in SL_2(F_p)$ then $({{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}}) \in F_p$. Thus, $\sqrt{trA+2}\in F_p$ too. The case $({{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}}) \equiv 0 (mod p)$ lead us to ${trA+2} \equiv 0 (mod p)$.



Using condition \eqref{tr}
 we show that matrix $B$ with trace $tr(\text{B})={{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}}$ and $det(B) = {{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}=1$ exists. For this goal we express ${{\left( \mu _{1}^{{}}+\mu _{2}^{{}} \right)}^{2}}=\mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2}+2=tr(A)+2$.  Since $(\frac{trA+2}{p})=1$ then the square root $\sqrt{tr(A)+2}=\sqrt{{{({{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}})}^{2}}}$ exists, i.e. matrix $tr(A)={{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}} \in F_p$.









If the matrix $B$ is an element from $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$, it yields to $\mu_1\mu_2 = 1$. Therefore, the matrices with $\mu_1\mu_2 = - 1$ are not valid. But if $B \in ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ then $\mu_1\mu_2 = \pm 1$.
% corresponding to sing $"-"$ in $\mu_1\mu_2 = \pm 1$ are not valid.

\[B=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
   \mu_1 \,\,\,& 0 \\
 0\,\,\,  & \mu_2  \\
\end{array} \right).\]



 The case, where $ \mu_1 = \mu_2= \mu$, implies that $\mu=g^2$, where $g\in F_p$, this condition demands to $\mu$ be a square in $F_p$. In this case $\mu \in F_p$ where $F_p$ is base field, so according to the theorem about Jordan basis Jordan matrix exists over this field. Considering the multiple eigenvalues $ \mu_1 = \mu_2= \mu$ and Viet theorem for characteristic polynomial, where  $b\in F_p$ holds, we see that $b= \mu_1 + \mu_2 = 2\mu$. So transformation of matrix $A$ in Jordan form is possible. Note that in case $p=2$ expression $ \mu = b/2 $ is impossible. But existing of such $ \mu $ can be proven in another way.


There are two possible matrix forms, either $A$ has 2 multiple eigenvalues or $A$ has different eigenvalues.  If $A$ has a form of a Jordan block then this case satisfies the conditions of the theorem \ref{CriterionPSLJordan} as well as when $A$ is a scalar matrix then it satisfies the condition of the theorem described below.

%$J_A= \left(
%	\begin{array}{cc}
%	\lambda \, & 1 \\
%	0 & \lambda \, \\
%	\end{array}
%\right)$

%if $\mu^2=\lambda $, we consider
 % $J_B= \left(
%	\begin{array}{cc}
%	\mu \, & x \\
%	0 & \mu  \\
%	\end{array}
%\right)$.

%Then

%$J_B^2= \left(
%	\begin{array}{cc}
%	\mu^2 \, & 2\mu x \\
%	0 & \mu^2  \\
%	\end{array}
%\right)$.

%Therefore choosing $x = (2\mu)^{-1} $ we obtain $J_B^2=J_A$. The requirement $det(A)=1$ implies that $\lambda = 1$ hence $\mu %=\pm 1$.

We note that the case when $\lambda=0$ is irrelevant for consideration, because of belonging $A$ to $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ demands $det(A)=1$.




%$A= \left($
 % \begin{array}{cc}
 %   \lambda \, & 1 \\
 %   0 & \lambda \, \\
 % \end{array}
%$\right)$


%$A=\left($ \begin{align}
%  & \lambda \,\,\,\,1 \\
% & 0\,\,\,\lambda  \\
%\end{align} $\right)$.

%  There are two forms of matrix possible in case if B has multiple eigen values. B has form of Jordan block or B has form of
 Two different eigenvalues $\lambda_1,  \lambda_2$ occur only in the case of a diagonal matrix. These eigenvalues are $\lambda_1= \mu_1^2,  \lambda_2=\mu_2^2$. In the case of Jordan block of size 2 by 2 only multiple eigenvalues are possible.

%$A=\left( \begin{align}
%  & \lambda \,\,\,\,1 \\
% & 0\,\,\,\lambda  \\
%\end{align} \right)$.


A sufficient condition in the subcase of the Jordan cell being obvious is the same existence of a root $\sqrt{\lambda }$ in the finite field ${{F}_{p}}$, $p>2$. It is this root that is the eigenvalue \[\mu =\sqrt{\lambda }\] of the matrix $B$.


Let us express the square by trace and determinant. Since $ \mu_1^2 + \mu_2^2 = (\mu_1 + \mu_2)^2  - 2\mu_1\mu_2$ then $(\mu_1 + \mu_2)^2  = \mu_1^2 + \mu_2^2  + 2\mu_1\mu_2 = tr(A) + 2$. A value in the left part is the quadratic residue so $tr(A) + 2$ is too.
 Since in $ESL_2(F_p)$ and  $det(A)$ admits as $1$ as well as $-1$ and in case action of such $A$ changes space orientation,
% are identified according to the factorization by the center of the
  $SL_2(F_p)$ then in case of $ESL_2(F_p)$ the both signs $"\pm"$ before the 2 in $tr(A)+2$ fit. Thus, in the case of $ESL_2(F_p)$ this conditions transforms in the form $tr(A) \pm2 $ due to possible root $B$ with $det(B)=-1$. But such case $B \notin SL_2(F_p)$. If $tr(A)+2$ is multiple to $p$ then characteristic polynomial  $\chi_A(x)$ of $A$ takes form $x^2+1$, because of general formula is such $\chi_A(x)$ has form  $x^2 - tr(A)x+detA$.

\textbf{Define} the \textit{polynomial squared}  if there is such ${{\chi }_{B}}(x) = x^2 - cx + d$, that $d=\mu_1 \mu_2, \, c= \mu_1 + \mu_2, \,  c,d \in F_p $  and $\mu^2_1 = \lambda_1$,  $\mu^2_2 =\lambda_2$, where  $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$ are e. v. of  another polynomial   ${{\chi }_{A}}(x)$.
We can formulate the similar criterion for a polynomial.
In particular  characteristic polynomials of $A$ and $B$  could be in such a role.
Let ${{\chi }_{A}}(x) = x^2 - ax + 1$, $(a \in F_p)$.

Let us investigate requirement of existence of squared polynomial.
%, in particular investigate relation between their roots.
%To such squared polynomial ${\chi}_{A}(x)$ exists we investigate relation between their roots.
We take into account that ${\chi }_B(x)$ for matrix for $SL_2(F_p)$, so $\mu_1 \mu_2=1$.  But roots of ${\chi }_{B}(x)$ and even ${\chi }_{A}(x)$ can belong to $F_{p^2}$ but not to $F_p$. So we will consider symmetric functions from $\lambda_1$ and  $\lambda_2$. $(\mu_1 +\mu_2)^2= \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 +2 \sqrt{\lambda_1 \lambda_2} = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 +2$ because of $\lambda_1 \lambda_2 =1$.
Therefore condition  $(\frac{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 +2}{p})\in \{0,1\}$ is sufficient that squared polynomial exists.

In the case $p=2$ this condition becomes to be
$(\frac{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 }{p})\in \{0,1\}$
 is sufficient for existing of squared polynomial ${\chi }_B(x)$.

The eigenvalues  $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ are determined as $\mu_i = \pm \sqrt{(\mu_i)^2}$, where $\lambda = \mu_i^2 \,\, i \in \{1,2\}$.
%Furthermore $\mu_i= \frac{ x \pm \sqrt{y}} {2} $.
A combination of signs in terms representing $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ have to satisfy condition of polynomial squared: $d=\mu_1 \mu_2, \, c= \mu_1 + \mu_2, \in F_p$.


%To prove the necessity of this condition
To prove for $A\in S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ that condition
\[(\frac{trA+2}{p})\in \{0,1\}\]
is sufficient for the existence of a solution of the equation $A={{X}^{2}}$ then we shall show that $\exists B:{{B}^{2}}=A$.  Let us prove that this condition $(\frac{trA+2}{p})\in \{0,1\}$  provides the existence of characteristic polynomial  $\chi_B(x)={{x}^{2}}-cx+1$  with the $c\in {{F}_{p}}$ whose roots are the eigenvalues $\mu _{1}^{{}},\,\,\mu _{2}^{{}}$  of the matrix $B$ and ${{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}=1$ provided that $\mu _{1}^{2},\mu _{2}^{2}$  are the eigenvalues of matrix  $A$.

The proof is very similar in case $A\in  GL_2 ({{F}_{p}})$, then the condition   $(\frac{trA + 2\sqrt{detA}}{p})=1$ is enough  for solvability of the equation  $A={{X}^{2}}$.


Consider the e. v.,  denoted by $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$,  of matrix $A$.  Then we need to find such $\mu _{1}^{{}},\,\,\mu _{2}^{{}}$ that ${{\lambda }_{1}}=\mu _{1}^{2},\,\,{{\lambda }_{2}}=\mu _{2}^{2}$ and ${{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}=1$.

Note that existing of such $\mu _{1}^{{}},\,\,\mu _{2}^{{}}$  implies the following condition
${{({{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}})}^{2}}=\mu _{1}^{2}+2{{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}+{{\mu }^2_{2}}=\mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2}+2={{\lambda }_{1}}+{{\lambda }_{2}}+2=trA+2.$
holds.  Consider  such $c$ that ${{c}^{2}}=trA+2,\,\,\,c\in {{F}_{p}}$. We prove that roots $\mu _{1}^{{}},\,\,\mu _{2}^{{}}$ of ${{\mu }^{2}}-c\mu +1$
endowed  the property  ${{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}=1$  and $\mu _{1}^{2},\,\,\mu _{2}^{2}$  coincide with ${{\lambda }_{1}},\,\,{{\lambda }_{2}}$.

Indeed, the equality ${{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}=1$ is provided by Viet theorem. It remains to show that $\mu _{1}^{2}={{\lambda }_{1}},\,\,\mu _{2}^{2}={{\lambda }_{2}}$ this is equivalent to we need to show the equality of polynomials $\chi(A) = \left( x-{{\lambda }_{1}} \right)\left( x-{{\lambda }_{2}} \right)$ and $\left( x-\mu _{1}^{2} \right)\left( x-\mu _{2}^{2} \right)$.
We have
$\left( x-{{\lambda }_{1}} \right)\left( x-{{\lambda }_{2}} \right)={{x}^{2}}-\left( {{\lambda }_{1}}+{{\lambda }_{2}} \right)x+{{\lambda }_{1}}{{\lambda }_{2}}={{x}^{2}}-\left( trA \right)x+\det A={{x}^{2}}-\left( trA \right)x+1.$  In the similar way $\left( x-\mu _{1}^{2} \right)\left( x-\mu _{2}^{2} \right)={{x}^{2}}-\left( \mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2} \right)x+\mu _{1}^{2}\mu _{2}^{2}= \\ = {{x}^{2}}-\left( \mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2}+2{{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}-2{{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}} \right)x+\mu _{1}^{2}\mu _{2}^{2}.$
Since $\mu _{1}^{{}},\,\,\mu _{2}^{{}}$  are roots of  ${{\mu }^{2}}-c\mu +1$ then according to Viet theorem: ${{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}=1$ and  ${{\mu}_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}}=c$, This implies
$\left( x-\mu _{1}^{2} \right)\left( x-\mu _{2}^{2} \right)={{x}^{2}}-\left( {{c}^{2}}-2 \right)x+{{1}^{2}}$.  Taking into account that ${{c}^{2}}=trA+2$ we derive  $\left( x-\mu _{1}^{2} \right)\left( x-\mu _{2}^{2} \right)={{x}^{2}}-\left( trA+2-2 \right)x+1={{x}^{2}}-\left( trA \right)x+1$,  which coincides with the characteristic polynomial $\chi(A)= \left( x-{{\lambda }_{1}} \right)\left( x-{{\lambda }_{2}} \right)$ for the matrix $A$. This completes the proof.


In cases when $A\in G{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ the proof is very similar.
\end{proof}


\begin{exm}
    Consider Fibonacci matrix $F=\left( \begin{array}{rr}
        0 &  \,\, 1  \\
        1 & \,\,  1
    \end{array}
   \right)$ in $S{{L}_{2}}\left( {{F}_{p}} \right)$ then ${{F}^{2}}=\left( \begin{array}{rr}
      1  &  \,\,1\\
       1 & \,\,2
   \end{array}
   \right)$ which confirms criterion \ref{CriterionPSL} of existing roots in $ES{{L}_{2}}\left( { \mathbb{F}_{p}} \right)$ because $trA-2=1$ because of 1 is square in each field ${\mathbb{F}_{p}}$ as well as in $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$.

Next one is
$R=\left( \begin{array}{rr}
      0  &  \,\,-2\\
       2 & \,\, 0
   \end{array}
   \right)$
 in $S{{L}_{2}}\left( {\mathbb{F}_{3}} \right)$ then
 $R^2=\left( \begin{array}{rr}
      -1  &  \,\,0\\
       0 & \,\, -1
   \end{array}
   \right)$.

  In another hand we can justify the root existing by criterion for $ES{{L}_{2}}\left( {\mathbb{F}_{3}} \right)$ because $tr{{R}^{2}}-2=0$.
\end{exm}

\begin{exm}
The case of roots contain in both cosets of quotient ${}^{ES{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{F} \right)}/{}_{S{{L}_{2}}\left( \mathbb{F} \right)}$ appear in particular matrix $A$ with $tr(A)=3$ and $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_{11}$. In fact, in this case $tr(A)-2=1$, $tr(A)+2=5$ one easily can verify that 5 is quadratic residue by  $11$ because of ${{4}^{2}}\equiv 5\left( \bmod 11 \right)$ and  $1$ is always square.
\end{exm}



\begin{exm}
Consider matrix equation $X^2=A$ with e.v. in ${{\mathbb{F}}_{9}}\backslash {{\mathbb{F}}_{3}}$ and having root in $ES{{L}_{2}}\left( {{\mathbb{F}}_{3}} \right)\backslash S{{L}_{2}}\left( {{\mathbb{F}}_{3}} \right)$ and check our new formula from Proposition \ref{formula} (which is directly below) for root expression. Let $A=\left( \begin{array}{rr}
   0\,\,&-1 \\
  1\,\,\,& 0 \\
\end{array} \right)$

 since $trA+2=2$ that is non-square residue in ${{\mathbb{F}}_{3}}$ but $trA-2=-(-1)=1$ in ${{\mathbb{F}}_{3}}$, then  according to our formula we use branch of expression with minus in $trA \pm 2$ i.e.
$\sqrt{A}=\frac{A-E}{\sqrt[{}]{trA-2}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt[{}]{trA-2}}\left( \begin{array}{rr}
   -0-1,\,\,\,\,\, & -1 \\
  \,1,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,& -0-1
\end{array}
\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt[{}]{trA-2}}\left( \begin{array}{rr}
   -1,\,\,\,\,\,&-1 \\
 \,1,\,\,\,\,\,&-1 \\
\end{array} \right)=\left( \begin{array}{rr}
   -1,\,\,\,\,\,&-1 \\
  \,1,\,\,\,\,\,&-1 \\
\end{array} \right)=\left( \begin{array}{rr}
   \,2,\,\,\,& -1 \\
  \,1,\,\,\,\,\,&2 \\
\end{array} \right) = B.$  Another branch with "=" before the root $trA \pm 2$ lead us to second root:
$\sqrt{A}= \frac{A-E}{-\sqrt[{}]{trA-2}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt[{}]{trA-2}}\left( \begin{array}{rr}
   -0+1,\,\,\,\,\, & 1 \\
  \,=1,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,& -0+1
\end{array}
\right)=\frac{1}{\sqrt[{}]{trA-2}}\left( \begin{array}{rr}
    1,\,\,\,\,\,&1 \\
 \,-1,\,\,\,\,\,&1 \\
\end{array} \right)= -B.$

Its ${{\chi }_{A}}(x)={{x}^{2}}+1=0$ therefore its roots are $\pm i\in {{\mathbb{F}}_{9}}\backslash {{\mathbb{F}}_{3}}$ and $\pm i$ are square in ${{\mathbb{F}}_{9}}$ that confirms our criterion \ref{CriterionPSL}.
\end{exm}


For case $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_p$ our criterion can be formulated in terms of Legendre symbol.
\begin{cor}\label{CriterionSL(2,p)}
Let $A$ be simple matrix and
$A \in {SL_2( \mathbb{F}_p)}$  \cite{LinearShpringer}, then
for matrix $A \in SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ there is a solution  $B \in SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ of the matrix equation
 \begin{equation}\label{Eq1}
X^2 = A
\end{equation}
if and only if

\begin{equation}\label{tr1}
\left(\frac{trA+2}{p}\right) \in \{0,1\}.
\end{equation}

If  $X \in ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ then the matrix equation  \eqref{Eq1} has a solution iff

\begin{equation}\label{tr2}
\left(\frac{trA \pm 2}{p}\right) \in \{0,1\}.
\end{equation}
This solution $X \in ESL_2(\mathbb{F}_p) \setminus SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ iff $\left(\frac{tr A - 2}{p}\right)=1$ or 0, but $\left(\frac{trA + 2}{p}\right)=-1$. Conversely $X \in SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ iff $\left(\frac{trA + 2}{p}\right)=1$.
Solutions $X_{i} \in ESL_2(\mathbb{F})$ and $SL_2(\mathbb{F})$ iff $\left(\frac{trA + 2}{p}\right)=1$ and $\left({trA - 2}{}\right)=1$.


In the case  $A \in GL_2 ({{\mathbb{F}}_{p}})$ this condition \eqref{tr} takes form:
 \begin{equation} \label{trGL}
\left(\frac{trA \pm 2\sqrt{detA}}{p} \right) \in \{0,1\}.
 \end{equation}
\end{cor}
The proof is the same but instead of $\mathbb{F}$ we put $\mathbb{F}_p$. But we emphasize that theorems of such a kind were for algebraic closed field before this paper.

\begin{cor}
If $A\in GL(F_2)$ the condition \ref{tr} takes form:
\[\left(\frac{trA}{p}\right) \in \{0,1\}. \]
\end{cor}

\begin{rem}
    The formulated criterion for a diagonizable matrix  is also true over fields $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$.
\end{rem}
\begin{proof}
The proof is the same only with the change of quadraticity criterion over the new field.
\end{proof}






\begin{cor} If matrix $A$ admits  diagonal form over ${{\text{F}}_{2}}$ then $A$ is square over ${{\text{F}}_{2}}$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
Since in $F_{2^n}$ all elements $g_i \in F_{2^n}$ are quadratic squares, therefore a diagonal matrix $A$ is always square of the mentioned above $B$ over $F_{2^n}$.
\end{proof}




\begin{prop}\label{formula}
If a simple matrix  $A\in S{{L}_{2}}({\mathbb{F}_{p}})$ and  $\left( \frac{Tr(A)+2}{p} \right)=1$, then

$$\sqrt{A}=\frac{ 1}{\pm \sqrt{trA \pm2}}\left( A \pm E \right),$$
where $E$ is identity element of $S{{L}_{2}}({\mathbb{F}_{p}})$, in case of sign '-' in $\left( A \pm E \right)$  roots  $\sqrt{A} \in ESL_{2}({\mathbb{F}_{p}})$.  Namely for $A= \left( \begin{array}{cc}
    a & b \\
     c & d \\
  \end{array} \right)$ in a coordinate form in case $\sqrt{A} \in SL_2({\mathbb{F}_{p}})$ we have
$
 {\sqrt{A}}= \frac{1}{\pm \sqrt{tr(A)+2}} \left(
  \begin{array}{cc}
    a+1 & b \\
     c & d+1 \\
  \end{array}
\right)$.

%For instance, $tr (E)=2$ and as a result $
% {\sqrt{A}}=  \frac{1}{\pm \sqrt{2+2}}\left(
%  \begin{array}{cc}
 %   2 & 0 \\
 %    0 & 2 \\
 % \end{array}
% \right) = \pm E$.


\end{prop}


\begin{proof}

Consider the characteristic equation for $A$:  ${{x}^{2}}-tr(A)x+\det (A)=0$.  According to Cayley Hamilton theorem we have
\begin{align*}
  & {{A}^{2}}-tr(A)A+E=0,  \\
  & {{A}^{2}}+E=tr(A)A.    \\
\end{align*}
  We add $2A$ to the both sides of this equation
\begin{align*}
  & {{A}^{2}}+2A+E=-tr(A)A+2A, \\
  & {{\left( A+E \right)}^{2}}=A\left( trA+2 \right).
\end{align*}
And finally  we express the root:
\begin{equation}\label{sq}
 \sqrt{A}=\frac{1}{\pm \sqrt{trA+2}}\left( A+E \right).
\end{equation}

%$\sqrt{A}=\frac{1}{\pm \sqrt{trA+2}}\left( A+E %\right).$

In a coordinate it takes the form:
$
 {\sqrt{A}}= \frac{1}{\pm \sqrt{trA+2}} \left(
  \begin{array}{cc}
    a+1 & b \\
     c & d+1 \\
  \end{array}
\right).$

The similar proof for the case ${trA-2}$ is square give us roots in $ ESL_2(\mathbb{F_p})$.

\begin{equation}\label{esq}
 \sqrt{A}=\frac{1}{\pm \sqrt{trA-2}}\left( A - E \right).
\end{equation}

In a coordinate form it presents by matrix:

$
 {\sqrt{A}}= \frac{1}{\pm \sqrt{trA-2}} \left(
  \begin{array}{cc}
    a-1 & b \\
     c & d-1 \\
  \end{array}
\right).$
  \end{proof}

The similar proof yields the formula of roots in $ ESL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and in $ ESL_2({k})$, where $k$ is arbitrary perfect field.

\begin{exm}
For instance, $tr (E)=2$ and as a result $
 {\sqrt{E}}=  \frac{1}{\pm \sqrt{2+2}}\left(
  \begin{array}{cc}
    2 & 0 \\
     0 & 2 \\
  \end{array}
\right) = \pm E.
$
\end{exm}

Note the analitical formula of root in $GL_2 (\mathbb{R})$ was found in \cite{DON} but for finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$ there did not found such formula in linear group of 2 dimension.

\begin{cor}
    The formula of 4-th power root is the following
    $$\sqrt[4]{A}=\frac{A \pm E \pm\sqrt{trA \pm 2}}{\pm \sqrt{ \pm \sqrt{trA \pm 2} \pm 2}}.$$
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    We construct the formula to 4-th power root in recursive way where base of recursion in formula \eqref{sq}. Taking into account $tr(A+E)=trA+2$  we obtain for case $det(A)=det(\sqrt{A})=1$ that  $\sqrt[4]{A}=\frac{\sqrt{A}+E}{\pm\sqrt{tr\sqrt{A}+2}}=\frac{A+E \pm\sqrt{trA+2}}{\pm \sqrt{\sqrt{trA+2}+2}}.$
\end{proof}

    Extended special linear group $ESL_2(k)$, where $k$ is arbitrary perfect field, is storage of all square matrix roots from $ESL_2(k)$.

\begin{prop} If matrix $A$ do not admits diagonal form over ${{\text{F}}_{2}}$ then $A$ is not square in $G{{L}_{2}}\left( {{\text{F}}_{2}} \right)$ over ${{\text{F}}_{2}}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
If matrix $A$ do not admits diagonal form over ${{\text{F}}_{2}}$ then $A$ is not square in $G{{L}_{2}}\left( {{\text{F}}_{2}} \right)$ over ${{\text{F}}_{2}}$.
We consider equation of form ${{X}^{2}}=A$ and show that it has not solutions over ${{\text{F}}_{2}}$ a $S{{L}_{2}}\left( {{\text{F}}_{2}} \right)$ in case ${{\chi }_{A}}\left( x \right) \neq {{\mu }_{A}}\left( x \right)$. The conditions of theorem implies that geometrical dimension  of e.v. is  1 but algebraic multiplicity of e.v. $\lambda $ is 2. We make prof by the contradiction, assuming that is true then

${\left(\begin{array}{cc}
   \lambda \,\,& 1 \\
  0\,\, & \lambda  \\
\end{array} \right)}^{2}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
   {{\lambda }^{2}}\,\, & 2\lambda  \\
  0 \,\, & {{\lambda }^{2}} \\
\end{array} \right)$  but
$\left( \begin{array}{cc}
   {{\lambda }^{2}}\,\,& 2\lambda \\
  0\,\, & {{\lambda}^{2}} \\
\end{array}\right)=
 \left(\begin{array}{cc}
   {{\lambda }^{2}}\,\,&0 \\
  0\,\,&{{\lambda }^{2}}\\
\end{array} \right)$ over ${{\text{F}}_{2}}$.
That contradicts to condition of this Theorem.
\end{proof}


Let $B$ has characteristic polynomial ${{x}^{2}}+bx+c$. It is well known that trace of $B$ is stable
under choosing of vector space base.

We denote Jordan form of matrix $A$ as ${{J}_{A}}$.
%We mean by $PS{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ its faithful representation.

\begin{lem}\label{Trace} If a matrix $A\in S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ has multiple eigenvalues ${{\beta }_{1}}={{\beta }_{2}}=\beta $  and non-trivial Jourdan block of size $2\times 2$ then $\beta \in {{\text{F}}_{p}}.$ % Note than in this case $det(A)=0$.
\end{lem}

Proof.  Since in this case eigenvalues are presented as elements of matrix $B$  standing on diagonal, then this matrix can be in form: $B=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
   \beta \,\,\,& 1 \\
  0\,\, & \beta  \\
\end{array} \right)$   or
$B=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
   \beta \,\,\,& 0 \\
 0\,\,\,  & \beta  \\
\end{array} \right).$

But the eigenvalues  of the matrix are multiples, therefore $\beta +\beta =tr(B)\in {{\text{F}}_{p}}$. This implies $2\beta =b$, therefore in a field of characteristic  non equal 2  we express this eigenvalue as $\beta =\frac{b}{2}$. Hence $\beta \in {{\text{F}}_{p}}$.  The proof is complete.


Our study of quadratic elements in $SL_2(\mathbb{F})$ gives an instrument to solve the problem
when a finite group G contains a conjugacy class $K$ whose square $K^2$ is again a conjugacy class \cite{Belt}.



\begin{thm}\label{CriterionPSLJordan}
 Under conditions $(\frac{\lambda }{p})=1$ in ${{F}_{p}}$ and matrix $A$ is similar to a Jordan block of the form
\begin{equation}\label{Jblock}
 {{J}_{A}}= \left(
  \begin{array}{cc}
    \lambda & 1 \\
     0 & \lambda \\
  \end{array}
\right)
\end{equation}
%${{J}_{A}}=$\left( \begin{align}
%  & \lambda \,\,\,1 \\
% & 0\,\,\,\lambda  \\
%\end{align} \right)
a square root $B$ of $A$ exists in $S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Assume that square from $A$ exists in $S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$  or in $ES{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ correspondently. We denote matrix $B$ transformed to upper triangular form by $U{{T}_{B}}$. Let us show that there that provided condition above it always exists such $B:\,\,UT_{B}^{2}={{J}_{A}}$, where $U{{T}_{B}}$ is $B$ transformed to UTM form.  Then we show that it implies existing  of solution of \[{{X}^{2}}=A. \]
From the existence of the Jordan block for $A$ follows the existence of a similarity transformation $U$ transforming ${{B}^{2}}$ to the Jordan normal form $J_B$ because of  $A = {{B}^{2}}$ and A has non-trivial Jordan block denoted by $J_A$. But square root from $B^2$ this operator $U$ transforms in upper triangular form $UT_B$. Then if we find solution for

\begin{equation}\label{uppertriang}
UT_B^2=J_A
\end{equation}

we can obtain solution for ${{X}^{2}}=A$ because of the following:


\begin{equation}\label{eqtransform}
A=U\cdot (U{{T}_{B}})^2\cdot {{U}^{-1}}=(U\cdot U{{T}_{B}}\cdot {{U}^{-1}})(U\cdot U{{T}_{B}}\cdot {{U}^{-1}})={{B}^{2}}.
\end{equation}

It means that such matrix $U{{T}_{B}}$ satisfying \eqref{eqtransform}, exists and it can be transformed  by the same similarity transformation by conjugation in form $U{{T}_{B}}={{U}^{-1}}BU$ by the same matrix that transforms $A$ in ${{J}_{A}}$ because of ${{B}^{2}}=A$. To show the existing of such solution of \eqref{uppertriang} we acting by invers transformation $A=U\cdot (U{{T}_{B}})^2\cdot {{U}^{-1}}=(U\cdot U{{T}_{B}}\cdot {{U}^{-1}})(U\cdot U{{T}_{B}}\cdot {{U}^{-1}})={{B}^{2}}$, where $U$ is similarity transformation $B$ to

%\[B=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
%   \mu_1 \,\,\,& 0 \\
% 0\,\,\,  & \mu_2  \\
%\end{array} \right).\]


$$U{{T}_{B}}=\left(
  \begin{array}{cc}
   \beta \,\,\, & \gamma  \\
  0\,\,\, & \beta  \\
  \end{array}
 \right).$$
%OLD VERSION OF BEGINNIG
%Assume that square from $A$ exists in $PS{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$. Let us show that there that provided condition above it always %exists such $B:\,\,{{B}^{2}}={{J}_{A}}$.  Let ${{B}^{2}}=A$.
%From the existence of the Jordan block for $A$ follows the existence of a similarity transformation for $B$ and the transforming %${{B}^{2}}$ to the Jordan normal form
%\[{{J}_{A}}={{U}^{-1}}{{B}^{2}}U={{U}^{-1}}BU{{U}^{-1}}BU.  \,  \]  %(1)
%  It means that such matrix $B$ exists and it can be transformed by the same similarity transformation by conjugation in form %${{U}^{-1}}BU$ by the same matrix that transform $A$ in ${{J}_{A}}$ because of ${{B}^{2}}=A$.
%Thus, without loosing a generality, we will present $A$  as ${{J}_{A}}$.
%We find such a matrix $B$ that $B=\sqrt{A}$. Then in case  if $B$ is presented in upper triangular matrix (UTM) form:
%$U{{T}_{B}}=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
%   \beta \,\,\, & \gamma  \\
%  0\,\,\,   &   \beta  \\
%\end{array} \right)$
note that its diagonal elements ${{b}_{11}}={{b}_{22}}=\beta $ are the same. Therefore according to Lemma \ref{Trace} we have $\beta \in {{F}_{p}}$. Even more easier we can deduce it without Lemma 19. We have ${{b}_{11}}={{b}_{22}}=\beta $, then  $\beta +\beta =\text{Tr}({{U}^{-1}}BU)$. Therefore $2\beta \in {{\text{F}}_{p}}$. It implies that $\beta \in {{F}_{p}}$ if $p>2$ and

$$(UT_{B})^{2}=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
  {{\beta }^{2}}\,\,\,  &  2\beta \gamma  \\
  0\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,  & {{\beta }^{2}} \\
\end{array} \right). $$

Here the element $\gamma $ can be chosen $\gamma :\,\,\, 2\beta \gamma =1$ so $\gamma = {2 \beta}^{-1}$ taking into account that $\beta =\sqrt{\lambda }$ which is already determined by $A$. Then  $(UT_{B})^{2}:$

$(UT_{B})^{2}=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
   {{\beta }^{2}}\,\,\, & 2\beta \gamma  \\
  0\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, & {{\beta }^{2}} \\
\end{array} \right)=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
   {{\beta }^{2}}\,\,\, & 1 \\
  0\,\,\,\,\, & {{\beta }^{2}} \\
\end{array} \right)=J_A = \left(
	\begin{array}{cc}
	\lambda \, & 1 \\
	0 & \lambda \, \\
	\end{array}
\right) $.

%Or more simpler
%$J_A= \left(
%	\begin{array}{cc}
%	\lambda \, & 1 \\
%	0 & \lambda \, \\
%	\end{array}
%\right)$


















%if $\mu^2=\lambda $, we consider
% $B= \left(
%	\begin{array}{cc}
%	\mu \, & x \\
%	0 & \mu  \\
%	\end{array}
%\right)$.

%Then

%$B^2= \left(
%	\begin{array}{cc}
%	\mu^2 \, & 2\mu x \\
%	0 & \mu^2  \\
%	\end{array}
%\right)$.

%Therefore choosing $x = (2\mu)^{-1} $ we obtain $J_B^2=J_A$. The requirement $det(A)=1$ implies that $\lambda = 1$ hence $\mu %=\pm 1$.



%Also according to Lemma \ref{Trace}
%eigenvalues $\beta \in {{F}_{p}}$ therefore $(UT_{B})^{2}\in {{M}_{2\times 2}}({{F}_{p}})$ i.e. $(UT_{B})^{2}$ is matrix over %${{F}_{p}}$.
%	The case if $B$ is presented in non-UMT form.
%In this case, we can bring B into the UTM form. Let's denote the resulting matrix as $B'$. Again on the diagonal of $B'$ are %${{b}_{11}}$ and ${{b}_{22}}$.
%In another hand $A={{(B')}^{2}}$ and there are two eigenvalues $\lambda $ on diagonal of $A$.
%Therefore $A={{(B')}^{2}}$ implies that ${{b}_{11}}={{b}_{22}}=\sqrt{\lambda }$ but according to the condition of this theorem %$\sqrt{\lambda }\in {{F}_{p}}$ because $(\frac{\lambda }{p})=1$ in ${{\text{F}}_{p}}.$ According to the classical theorem of %linear algebra, the traces of such (similar) matrices are the same.  I.e. $\text{Tr}(B)=Tr({{U}^{-1}}BU)$. If ${{U}^{-1}}BU$ form %then it has eigenvalues on diagonal  so $\beta +\beta =\text{Tr}({{U}^{-1}}BU)$. Therefore $2\beta =2{{b}_{11}}\in %{{\text{F}}_{p}}$. It implies that $\beta \in {{F}_{p}}$ if $p>2$. Thus eigenvalues of $B'$ belongs to ${{\text{F}}_{p}}$.

%But the eigenvalues are multiples, so $\beta +\beta =tr(B)\in {{\text{F}}_{p}}$. It follows  $2\beta =b$ therefore, in the field %not characteristics 2 we get $\beta =\frac{b}{2}$.
%In both cases, we obtain ${{b}_{11}}={{b}_{22}}=b\in {{F}_{p}}$.




Furthermore we show that these conditions is also necessary but not only sufficient. It means if $(\frac{\lambda }{p})=-1$, then there are no matrix $B$ over $S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ such that ${{B}^{2}}=A$. By a reversal of theorem condition  and using the representation in the form of UTM for and for we see that $B$ from $PS{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ such that ${{B}^{2}}=A$. We see that according to the Lemma \ref{Trace}
 the eigenvalue of $B$ over lie in the main field ---  ${{\text{F}}_{p}}$. However, we assumed that  $(\frac{\lambda }{p})=-1$. Thus we obtain the desirable  contradiction.

Let us show that condition of  non-diagonalizability of matrix is necessary in the conditions of this Theorem. By virtue of the well-known theorem stating that if the algebraic multiplicity is equal to the geometric  multiplicity for each eigenvalue, then matrix is diagonalizable otherwise it is not diagonalizable, we see that if the condition of  similarity  to  ${{J}_{A}}=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
   \lambda \,\,\, & 1 \\
  0\,\,\, & \lambda  \\
\end{array} \right)$
indicated in this Theorem \ref{CriterionPSLJordan}  does not holds, then  such $A$ satisfy the conditions of this Theorem \ref{CriterionPSL}, where algebraic multiplicity is equal to geometrical. And since the condition \ref{Jblock} of this criterion is nature, therefore, it is no longer necessary to prove the non-diagonalizability condition in Theorem \ref{CriterionPSLJordan}.


Proof of \textbf{necessity}.
Furthermore we show that these conditions is also necessary but not only sufficient. It means if $(\frac{\lambda }{p})=-1$, then there are no matrix $B$ having non trivial Jordan block over $PS{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ and $S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ such that ${{B}^{2}}=A$. By a reversal of theorem condition  and using the representation in the form of UTM for and for we see that $B$ from $PS{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ such that ${{B}^{2}}=A$. We see that according to the Lemma  the eigenvalue of $B\in S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$or $B\in PS{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ correspondingly,  lie in the main field -- ${{\text{F}}_{p}}$. Furthermore according to Lemma \ref{eigenval} if $\beta $ is an eigenvalue for $B$ then ${{\beta }^{2}}$ is an eigenvalue for ${{B}^{2}}$, so we have ${{\beta }^{2}}=\lambda $.   However, we assumed that $(\frac{\lambda }{p})=-1$. Thus we obtain the desirable  contradiction.    The eigenvalue $\beta$ has geometrical dimension 1, because of in oppositive case geometrical $\dim\beta =2$ (dimension of eigenvector space of $\beta$), then we get that $J_{B}^{2}$ is only scalar matrix $B$.




The proof is fully complete.

Consider the commutative matrix algebra $A\lg \left[ A \right]=\left\langle E,A \right\rangle $ over ${{F}_{p}}$, where$A\in S{{L}_{2}}\left( {{F}_{p}} \right)$, A  is semisimple without multiple e.g. and $E$ is identity matrix.
Let us consider such formulation of Weederbern Artin theorem (Theorem W. A.). Each simple algebra is isomorphic to full matrix ring over algebra with division.

We refer to such formulation of theorem Wederburn Artin from Vanderwarden's book [1, page 372, 1979 year].
\textbf{Theorem W. A.}

 \begin{thm} Every artinian simple algebra with 1 is isomorphic to a complete matrix ring ${{M}_{{{n}_{i}}}}[{{D}_{i}}]$ over a division algebra ${{D}_{i}}$.
\end{thm}

Recall well known statement.
\begin{prop}
 Every finite commutative division algebra ${{D}_{i}}$ is  finite field.
\end{prop}

The following Lemma \ref{IsomwithField} can be proved with using of Weederbern Artin  theorem in the following way.
As well known that every finite commutative division algebra is isomorphic to finite field.
(Note that the field is a division commutative algebra and complete matrix ${{M}_{2\times 2}}[{{F}_{p}}]$  ring over ${{F}_{p}}$ is algebra.)
But we need more specialized isomorphism making connection between $A$ and its e.g. as element of ${{F}_{p^2}}$ so we will construct it now.

Since ${{F}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$ is simple commutative algebra and elements of group  $A\lg \left[ A \right]=\left\langle E,A \right\rangle $ with additional zero matrix $2\times 2$ forms an commutative matrix ring then according to Weederbern Artin theorem we have $A\left[ M \right]\simeq {{F}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$.  Kelly Hamilton theorem yields that dimension of such algebra $A\lg \left[ A \right]$ is 2 because of characteristic polynomial $\chi_A(x)$ of $A$ has degree 2.

To give a self-contained proof, we propose the following Lemma.

Firstly we consider case $A\in S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ but after our reasoning can be easy extended on the group $G{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ because the property property of the $\det A=1$ will not be involved in our reasoning.

\begin{lem}\label{IsomwithField}
 The matrix algebra $Alg [A]=\left\langle E,\,\,A \right\rangle \simeq {{F}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$.
\end{lem}
% Lemma about isomorphism.

\begin{proof}
We show that algebra $Alg \left[ M \right]=\left\langle E,A \right\rangle $ is isomorphic to finite field ${{F}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$.
As well-known from Galois theory, a quadratic extension of $F_p$
can be constructed by involving of any external element.
As well-known from Galois theory, a quadratic extension of ${{F}_{p}}$ can be constructed by involving of any external element $g\in {{F}_{{{p}^{2}}}}\backslash {{F}_{p}}$  relatively to ${{F}_{p}}$. We denote this element by $i$, in particular, for $p=4m+3$ it may be an element satisfying the relation ${{i}^{2}}=-1$.
Note that the matrix of the rotation by 90 degrees, that is a matrix
$$I:= \left( \begin{array}{cc}
  0\,\,\,\,&1 \\
 -1\,\,&0 \\
 \end{array} \right) ={{\rho }_{90}}$$
%$I:=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
%  & \,\,0\,\,\,\,1 \\
% & -1\,\,0 \\
%\end{ array}\right) ={{\rho }_{90}}$,
 satisfies this relation and can used as an example of matrix $A$. In case when $p=4m+3$  such matrix $J:\,\,\varphi (J)=j$,  ${{j}^{2}}=-1$ exists too.

Obviously $\det A=1$, that's why $A\in S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ and ${{\mu }_{A}}(x)$ is irreducible.
We define mapping $\varphi :\,\,{{y}_{1}}A+{{x}_{1}}E\,\to ae+b\lambda ;\,\,\,\,a,b\in {{\text{F}}_{p}}$.
The mapping $\varphi $ can be more broadly described, in $S{{L}_{2}}[{{F}_{p}}]$ such a way that a matrix $A$   is found such that ${{A}^{2}}=-E$, then its e.g. $\lambda $ is assigned to it in the field ${{F}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$, while $\lambda \in {{F}_{{{p}^{2}}}}\backslash {{F}_{p}}$.
$\varphi :\,\,{{y}_{1}}A+{{x}_{1}}E\,\to ae+b\lambda ;\,\,\,\,a,b\in {{\text{F}}_{p}}$.
According to assumption of Lemma the matrix $A$ is semisimple and has not multiple eigenvalues (e.g.) which are not squares in ${{\text{F}}_{p}}$, so ${{\chi }_{A}}\left( x \right)$  is irreducible because of definition of semisimple matrix and condition ${{\lambda }_{1}}\ne {{\lambda }_{2}}$. According to Lemma about Frobenius automorphism its eigenvalues are conjugated in ${{\text{F}}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$.
The method of constructing of $\sqrt{A}$ is the following. Having isomorphism $A\lg \left[ A \right]=\left\langle E,A \right\rangle \simeq {{\text{F}}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$ we set a correspondence $\lambda \leftrightarrow A$ and correspondence between groups operations in ${{\text{F}}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$ and $A\lg \left[ A \right]$.  Therefore solving equation ${{\left( x+\lambda y \right)}^{2}}=\lambda $ relatively coefficients $x,\,\,y\in {{\text{F}}_{p}}$ we obtain coefficients for expression for $\sqrt{A}$ i.e. $\sqrt{A}=x+Ay$.
To prove the isomorphism, we establish a bijection between the generators of the algebra $A\lg \left[ A \right]=\left\langle E,A \right\rangle $ and the field ${{F}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$. It is necessary to establish in more detail that $A\leftrightarrow \lambda $ and  $E\leftrightarrow e$ also  the correspondence between the neutral elements of both structures, i.e. $\varphi \left( {\bar{0}} \right)=0$ where $0$ is the zero matrix.
To complete proof, it remains to show that the kernel of this homomorphism $\varphi $ is trivial. To do this, we show that among the elements of the algebra there are no identical ones. The surjectivity of $\varphi $ is obvious.  From the opposite,  we assume ${{y}_{1}}A+{{x}_{1}}E={{y}_{2}}A+{{x}_{2}}E$, ${{x}_{i}},\,{{y}_{i}}\in {{F}_{p}}$.  Then ${{y}_{1}}A+{{x}_{1}}E={{y}_{2}}A+{{x}_{2}}E$ it yields that
$\left( {{y}_{1}}-{{y}_{2}} \right)E=\left( {{x}_{1}}-{{x}_{2}} \right)A$,
which is impossible since the characteristic polynomial of the matrix $A$ is irreducible but  the characteristic polynomial of the identity matrix is reducible. Therefore, our algebra $A\lg \left[ A \right]$ is isomorphic to the completely linear space of linear polynomials from $E$ and $A$.
In the similar way we prove that polynomial of form $xe+y\lambda $ where $x,\,\,y\in {{F}_{p}}$ do not repeat. The proof is based on oppositive assumption about coinciding ${{x}_{1}}e+{{y}_{1}}\lambda ={{x}_{2}}e+{{y}_{2}}\lambda$ of polynomial with different coefficients. Then equality ${{x}_{1}}e+{{y}_{1}}\lambda ={{x}_{2}}e+{{y}_{2}}\lambda$  implies that $\left( {{y}_{1}}-{{y}_{2}} \right)\lambda =\left( {{x}_{1}}-{{x}_{2}} \right)e$ i.e. ${{y}_{1}}={{y}_{2}}$ and ${{x}_{1}}={{x}_{2}}$ that contradicts to assumption.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}\label{inFp^2}
If a matrix $A\in G{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ is semisimple with different eigenvalues and at least one an eigenvalue ${{\lambda }_{i}} \in F_{p^2} \setminus F_{p}$, $ i\in \{1,2\},  \, p>2$, then $\sqrt{A}\in G{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ iff of $A$ satisfies:

 \, \, in \, \, the \, \, square \, \, extention \, \, that \, \, is \, \, {{F}_{p^2}}.
 \end{equation*}
%$(\frac{{{\lambda }_{i}}}{p})=1$ in ${{F}_{p^2}}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Firstly, we consider most complex and interesting case when $A$ is not diagonalizable, then ${{\chi }_{A}}\left( x \right)$ is irreducible over  ${{F}_{p}}$. By assumption, the matrix is semisimple and its characteristic polynomial is irreducible. So root $\lambda $ of ${{\chi }_{A}}(x)$ belongs to the quadratic extension of the field ${{F}_{p}}$. Since each element of ${{F}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$ can be presented in form $a+b\lambda ,\,\,\,a,b\in {{F}_{p}}$, then we can construct mapping of matrix algebra generators $E$ and $A$  in generators of ${{F}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$ and apply the aforementioned Lemma \ref{IsomwithField} about isomorphism establish correspondence between property be square in ${{\text{F}}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$ and in  $Alg \left[ A \right]=\left\langle E,A \right\rangle $. If one e.v. ${{\lambda}_{i}}$ is square in $F_{p^2}$ then so is second e.v. because of they are conjugated as roots of characteristic polynomial $\chi_A(x)$ by theorem about Frobenius automorphism (Frobenius endomorphism in perfect field became to be automorphism).
\end{proof}










%\begin{lem}  If  $A\in S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$  then condition
%\[(\frac{trA+2}{p})\in \{0,1\}\]
%is sufficient for the existence of a solution of the equation $A={{X}^{2}}$.
%In case $A\in PS{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ ( $GL_2 ({{F}_{p}})$ ) then the condition $(\frac{trA \pm 2}{p})=1$  $((\frac{trA + %2\sqrt{detA}}{p})=1)$ is enough  for solvability of the equation  $A={{X}^{2}}$.
%\end{lem}

%\begin{proof}
%We shall prove that $\exists B:{{B}^{2}}=A$. Let us prove that this condition $(\frac{trA+2}{p})\in \{0,1\}$  provides the %existing of characteristic polynomial  $P(x)={{x}^{2}}-cx+1$  with the $c\in {{F}_{p}}$ whose roots are the eigenvalues $\mu %_{1}^{{}},\,\,\mu _{2}^{{}}$  of the matrix $B$ and ${{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}=1$ provided that $\mu _{1}^{2},\mu _{2}^{2}$  are %the eigenvalues of matrix  $A$.

%Consider the e. v.,  denoted by $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$,  of matrix $A$.  Then we need to find such $\mu _{1}^{{}},\,\,\mu %_{2}^{{}}$ that ${{\lambda }_{1}}=\mu _{1}^{2},\,\,{{\lambda }_{2}}=\mu _{2}^{2}$ and ${{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}=1$.

%Note that existing of such $\mu _{1}^{{}},\,\,\mu _{2}^{{}}$  implies the following condition
%${{({{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}})}^{2}}=\mu _{1}^{2}+2{{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}+{{\mu }_{2}}+{{\mu }_{2}}=\mu _{1}^{2}+\mu %_{2}^{2}+2={{\lambda }_{1}}+{{\lambda }_{2}}+2=trA+2.$
%holds.  Consider  such $c$ that ${{c}^{2}}=trA+2,\,\,\,c\in {{F}_{p}}$. We prove that roots $\mu _{1}^{{}},\,\,\mu _{2}^{{}}$ of %${{\mu }^{2}}-c\mu +1$
%endowed  the property  ${{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}=1$  and $\mu _{1}^{2},\,\,\mu _{2}^{2}$  coincide with ${{\lambda %}_{1}},\,\,{{\lambda }_{2}}$.

%Indeed, the equality ${{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}=1$ is provided by Viet theorem. It remains to show that $\mu _{1}^{2}={{\lambda %}_{1}},\,\,\mu _{2}^{2}={{\lambda }_{2}}$ this is equivalent to we need to show the equality of polynomials $\chi(A) = \left( %x-{{\lambda }_{1}} \right)\left( x-{{\lambda }_{2}} \right)$ and $\left( x-\mu _{1}^{2} \right)\left( x-\mu _{2}^{2} \right)$.
%We have
%$\left( x-{{\lambda }_{1}} \right)\left( x-{{\lambda }_{2}} \right)={{x}^{2}}-\left( {{\lambda }_{1}}+{{\lambda }_{2}} %\right)x+{{\lambda }_{1}}{{\lambda }_{2}}={{x}^{2}}-\left( trA \right)x+\det A={{x}^{2}}-\left( trA \right)x+1$.  In the similar %way $\left( x-\mu _{1}^{2} \right)\left( x-\mu _{2}^{2} \right)={{x}^{2}}-\left( \mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2} \right)x+\mu %_{1}^{2}\mu _{2}^{2}={{x}^{2}}-\left( \mu _{1}^{2}+\mu _{2}^{2}+2{{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}-2{{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}} \right)x+\mu %_{1}^{2}\mu _{2}^{2}$.
%Since $\mu _{1}^{{}},\,\,\mu _{2}^{{}}$  are roots of  ${{\mu }^{2}}-c\mu +1$ then according to Viet theorem: ${{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu %}_{2}}=1$ and  ${{\mu}_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}}=c$, This implies
%$\left( x-\mu _{1}^{2} \right)\left( x-\mu _{2}^{2} \right)={{x}^{2}}-\left( {{c}^{2}}-2 \right)x+{{1}^{2}}$.  Taking into %account that ${{c}^{2}}=trA+2$ we derive  $\left( x-\mu _{1}^{2} \right)\left( x-\mu _{2}^{2} \right)={{x}^{2}}-\left( trA+2-2 %\right)x+1={{x}^{2}}-\left( trA \right)x+1$,  which coincides with the characteristic polynomial for the matrix $A$ $\chi(A)= %\left( x-{{\lambda }_{1}} \right)\left( x-{{\lambda }_{2}} \right)$. This completes the proof.

\textbf{Hypothesis}.  If we consider vector space over the same perfect field $k$ over which we consider $S{{L}_{2}}(k)$ then we have $\sqrt[3]{A}\in Span\{A,\,\,E\}$ over  $k$, where Span is linear span.

For proof we take into account Kelly Hamilton's equation and apply a reduction transformation of the second degree, then we get an expression similar to
$\sqrt[3]{A}=\frac{A+tr\left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right)\det (\sqrt[3]{A})}{t{{r}^{2}}\left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right)- \sqrt[3]{\det \left( A \right)}}$
which after transformations yields expression of root $\sqrt[3]{A}=\lambda A+\beta $, where  $\lambda, \beta \in k$.


\textbf{Proposition}.  If $B\in S{{L}_{2}}({{\mathbb{F}}_{p}})$ is root of equation ${{X}^{3}}=A$, then $$B=\frac{A+tr(\sqrt[3]{A})\sqrt[3]{\det (A)}}{tr{{\left( \sqrt{A} \right)}^{2}}-\sqrt[3]{\det (A)}},$$ where $A\in S{{L}_{2}}({{\mathbb{F}}_{p}})$.

\begin{proof}
Proof.  If $\sqrt[3]{A}\in S{{L}_{2}}({{\mathbb{F}}_{p}})$ then we consider Kelly Hamilton equation (K.H.E.)${{A}^{3}}-tr\left( A \right){{A}^{2}}+\left( {{\lambda }_{1}}{{\lambda }_{2}}+{{\lambda }_{1}}{{\lambda }_{3}}+{{\lambda }_{2}}{{\lambda }_{3}} \right)A-\det \left( A \right)=0$.
Note, that $tr{{\left( A \right)}^{2}}={{\left( {{\lambda }_{1}}+{{\lambda }_{2}}+{{\lambda }_{3}} \right)}^{2}}=\lambda _{1}^{2}+\lambda _{2}^{2}+\lambda _{3}^{2}-\left( {{\lambda }_{1}}{{\lambda }_{2}}+{{\lambda }_{1}}{{\lambda }_{3}}+{{\lambda }_{2}}{{\lambda }_{3}} \right)$.

Consider  K.H.E.  for  $A:\, dimA=2$,  ${{A}^{2}}-tr\left( A \right)\cdot A+\det \left( A \right)\cdot 1=0$.
Multiplying last equation on $A$ admit us obtain the chain of transformation:
\begin{align} \label{KHE}
   {{A}^{3}} & =\left( tr\left( A \right)A-\det \left( A \right) \right)A=tr\left( A \right){{A}^{2}}- \det \left( A \right)A= \nonumber\\
   & =tr\left( A \right)\left( tr\left( A \right)A-\det \left( A \right) \right)-\det \left( A \right)A=  \nonumber\\[-3mm]
   & ~ \\[-3mm]
  & =tr{{\left( A \right)}^{2}}A-tr\left( A \right)\det \left( A \right)-\det \left( A \right)A= \nonumber\\
 & =\left( tr{{\left( A \right)}^{2}}-\det \left( A \right) \right)A-tr\left( A \right)\det \left( A \right). \nonumber
\end{align}

By applying substitute matrix $\sqrt[3]{A}$ instead of $A$ we express

\begin{equation}\label{2}
\sqrt[3]{A}=\frac{A + tr\left(     \sqrt[3]{A} \right)\sqrt[3]{\det A}}{tr^{2}{{\left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right)}}-\sqrt[3]{\det \left( A \right)}}.					
\end{equation}

Thus, $\sqrt[3]{A}=\frac{A\,+tr\left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right)\sqrt[3]{\det \left( A \right)}}{\,\left( t{{r}^{2}}\left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right)-\sqrt[3]{\det \left( A \right)} \right)}$.

Note that $\det \left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right)=\sqrt[3]{\det \left( A \right)}$ because of determinant is homomorphism.

But $tr\left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right)$ is still not computed.
 From \eqref{KHE}
 we conclude \\ ${A}^{3}=\left( tr{{\left( A \right)}^{2}}-\det \left( A \right) \right)A-tr\left( A \right)\det \left( A \right).$ Computing a trace from both sides we obtain
% Therefore we consider
$tr\left( {{A}^{3}} \right)=tr{{\left( A \right)}^{3}}-3\det \left( A \right)tr\left( A \right)$.

We put $\sqrt[3]{A}$ instead of $A$, then we get
$tr\left( A \right)=tr{{\left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right)}^{3}}-3\sqrt[3]{\det A}tr\left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right).$

We need to solve
$tr\left( A \right)=tr{{\left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right)}^{3}}-3\sqrt[3]{\det A}tr\left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right)$.

We denote $\sqrt[3]{A}$ by $X$ and obtain the equation

$${{X}^{3}}-3\sqrt[3]{\det \left( A \right)}X-tr\left( A \right)=0.$$

The \emph{solvability} of this equation over base field $\mathbb{F}_p$ is equivalent to the \emph{existence} of a trace $\sqrt[3]{A}$ in the base field.
%$\sqrt[3]{A} {\,\left( t{{r}^{2}}\left( \sqrt[3]{A} \right)-\sqrt[3]{\det \left( A \right)} \right)} = {A\,+tr\left( \sqrt[3]{A} %\right)\sqrt[3]{\det \left( A \right)}}$.

Assume that  $(\frac{{{\lambda }_{1}}}{p})=-1,\,\,(\frac{{{\lambda }_{2}}}{p})=-1$ prove, that while $\sqrt{A}\notin S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$. We use proof by contradiction. Let  $(\frac{{{\lambda }_{1}}}{p})=-1,\,\,(\frac{{{\lambda }_{2}}}{p})=-1$  therefore roots from eigenvalues ${{\lambda }_{1}},\,\,{{\lambda }_{2}}$ in general belongs to ${{\text{F}}_{{{p}^{2}}}}$ while its roots ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$ is not conjugated as roots from different values of ${{\lambda }_{1}},\,\,{{\lambda }_{2}}$.

Let's find minimal polynomial for $B=\sqrt{A}$.
    Minimal polynomial of matrix $B$ is ${{\mu }_{B}}(x)={{x}^{2}}-bx+c$ and it has different roots ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$, where ${{\mu }_{1}}+{{\mu }_{2}}=Tr(B)=b$ e $\det B={{\mu }_{1}}{{\mu }_{2}}$. From the existence of diagonal representation for $A$ reducibility of ${{\mu }_{A}}\left( x \right)$ follows. From the reducibility of ${{\mu }_{A}}\left( x \right)$ over ${{\text{F}}_{p}}$ and the fact that ${{\lambda }_{1}}\ne {{\lambda }_{2}}$ follows ${{\mu }_{1}},\,\,{{\mu }_{2}}$ is not  conjugated as the roots of different values of ${{\lambda }_{1}},\,\,{{\lambda }_{2}}$ and it is obvious that $\mu _{1}^{2}\,\ne \,\mu _{2}^{2}$. But the root ${{\mu }_{1}}$ is conjugated with $-{{\mu }_{1}}$ and ${{\mu }_{1}}\in {{\text{F}}_{{{p}^{2}}}}\backslash {{\text{F}}_{p}}$. But $-{{\mu }_{1}}$ is also a root, since ${{\left( \pm {{\mu }_{1}} \right)}^{2}}={{\lambda }_{1}}$ therefore it can be the root for ${{\mu }_{B}}(x)$. Similar situation is with root ${{\mu }_{2}}$ and $-{{\mu }_{2}}$. Therefore, we indicated as many as 4 roots for ${{\mu }_{B}}(x)$ but $B\in S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{{{p}^{2}}}})$ therefore $\deg \left( {{\mu }_{B}}(x) \right)=2$. This contradiction arises from the assumption that$\sqrt{A}\in S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ on condition $(\frac{{{\lambda }_{1}}}{p})=-1,\,\,(\frac{{{\lambda }_{2}}}{p})=-1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem} \label{diagonal form and 2 non quadratic residue}
 If $A\in S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ possesses the capacity to be in diagonal Jordan form over ${{\text{F}}_{p}}$ and $(\frac{{{\lambda }_{1}}}{p})=-1,\,\,(\frac{{{\lambda }_{2}}}{p})=1$,  then such case does not give the existence of solution of ${{X}^{2}}=A$ in $S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$.
\end{rem}

\begin{proof}  The condition  $(\frac{{{\lambda }_{1}}}{p})=-1$ means, that $\sqrt{{{\lambda }_{1}}}={{\beta }_{1}}\in {{\text{F}}_{{{p}^{2}}}}\backslash {{\text{F}}_{p}}$  and simultaneously $\sqrt{{{\lambda }_{2}}}={{\beta }_{2}}\in {{\text{F}}_{p}}$,  therefore ${{\beta }_{1}}+{{\beta }_{2}}=Tr(B)\notin {{F}_{p}}$. This implies non-existing of ${{\mu }_{B}}\left( x \right)$ over ${{\text{F}}_{p}}$.
\end{proof}

The following theorem  it is true  for $S{{L}_{2}}({k})$, even  $k$ is arbitrary perfect field. The following proof works for arbitrary perfect $k$ too.
\begin{thm}
%(Theorem 2.)
 If a matrix $A\in S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ is semisimple and diagonalizable over ${{\text{F}}_{p}}$ and $(\frac{{{\lambda }_{1}}}{p})=(\frac{{{\lambda }_{2}}}{p})=-1$, then  for the existing $\sqrt{A}$, it is necessary and sufficient, that $A$ is similar to scalar matrix $D$.
 \end{thm}

\begin{proof}
From the facts that $(\frac{{{\lambda }_{1}}}{p})=(\frac{{{\lambda }_{2}}}{p})=-1$ and the square of diagonal matrix is again the diagonal matrix follows the existence of root only in the off diagonal form, therefore we must find the solution $M$ among the set of non-diagonalizable matrices
$ D=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
    {{d}_{1}}\,\,\, & 0 \\
  0\,\,\, & {{d}_{2}} \\
 \end{array} \right) $
is the diagonal representation of matrix $A$, and let
 \begin {equation}\label{D}
 D={{M}^{2}},
\end {equation}
where $M\in S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$. Because of $(\frac{{{d}_{1}}}{p})=(\frac{{{d}_{2}}}{p})=-1$ there is a  root in non-diagonal form. Also we note that there is a conjugation matrix $X$,


$$X=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
   m_{11}^{-1}\,\,\,& 0 \\
  0\,\,\,\, & m_{21}^{-1} \\
\end{array}  \right),$$  transforming  $M$  to $\tilde{M}$, where $\tilde{M}$ has following form

$$\tilde{M}=~\left( \begin{array}{cc}
   {{m}_{11}}\,\,\,&1 \\
  {{m}_{21}}\,\, &{{m}_{22}} \\
\end{array} \right). $$

Let's transform the equality $D={{M}^{2}}$ into $XD{{X}^{-1}}=XM{{X}^{-1}}XM{{X}^{-1}}$, where $XM{{X}^{-1}}=\tilde{M}$.
Note that $D$ and $XD{{X}^{-1}}$ have identical eigenvalues. Therefore we can solve the equation \eqref{D} for $XD{{X}^{-1}}$.  Let's consider matrix equation  $D={{M}^{2}}$,  let's transform it by conjugation
$D=XD{{X}^{-1}}=XM{{X}^{-1}}\cdot XM{{X}^{-1}}=\tilde{M}\tilde{M}={{\tilde{M}}^{2}}$,
wherein \\ $M=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
  & {{m}_{11}}\,\,\,\,{{m}_{12}} \\
 & {{m}_{21}}\,\,{{m}_{22}} \\
\end{array} \right)$, \,
$X=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
  & m_{11}^{-1}\,\,\,0 \\
 & 0\,\,\,\,\,\,m_{21}^{-1} \\
\end{array} \right)$
  and
$XM{{X}^{-1}}=\left( \begin{array}{ll}
   {{m}_{11}}\,\,\,\,& 1 \\
  {{m}_{21}}\,\, & {{m}_{22}} \\
\end{array} \right).$

%for obtaining such conjugation matrix we use
%$X=\left( \begin{array}{cc}
%  & m_{11}^{-1}\,\,\,0 \\
% & 0\,\,\,\,\,\,m_{21}^{-1} \\
%\end{array} \right).$


 Since $D$ is a diagonal matrix, then it belongs to the commutative subgroup of diagonal matrices from  $S{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$, lets denote it as  $DS{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$.
Therefore and  $~XD{{X}^{-1}}$  is also a diagonal matrix. Moreover, due to the commutativity of the field ${{F}_{p}}$ we have $~XD{{X}^{-1}}=D.$
Now let's solve the matrix equation  for the reduced $\tilde{M}$

 \begin {equation}\label{XDX}
 D=~XD{{X}^{-1}}=(XM{{X}^{-1}})(XM{{X}^{-1}})={{\tilde{M}}^{2}},
\end {equation}

Note that equations \eqref{XDX} and \eqref{D} are equivalent since they are obtained by similarity transformations.

Note that equations (2) and (1) are equivalent since they are obtained by similarity transformations.
Let's write down the equation $$ {{\tilde{M}}^{2}} = {{\left( \begin{array}{cc}
  & {{m}_{11}}\,\,\,\,1 \\
 & {{m}_{21}}\,\,\,{{m}_{22}} \\
\end{array} \right)}^{2}}= \left( \begin{array}{cc}
  & {{d}_{1}}\,\,\,0 \\
 & 0\,\,\,{{d}_{2}} \\
\end{array} \right). $$

Thence we obtain the system of equations
$$\left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
  {{m}_{21}}+m_{11}^{2}={{d}_{1}} \\
 {{m}_{21}}+m_{22}^{2}={{d}_{2}} \\
 {{m}_{11}}+{{m}_{22}}=0, \\
\end{array} \right.$$
by substitution $m_{11}$ from the equation 3) ${{m}_{22}}=-{{m}_{11}}$ into equations 1) and 2) we express from \[2) \, \, {{m}_{21}}+m_{22}^{2}={{d}_{2}} \Rightarrow   {{m}_{21}}+{{(-m_{11}^{{}})}^{2}}={{d}_{2}}\]

% \[2){{m}_{21}}+m_{22}^{2}={{d}_{2}} %\Rightarrow \]\[ \Rightarrow {{m}_{21}}+{{(-%m_{11}^{{}})}^{2}}={{d}_{2}}\]

also we take into consideration equation 1) $m_{11}^{2}+{{m}_{21}}={{d}_{1}}$. Thence ${{d}_{1}}={{d}_{2}}$ or more conveniently $d={{d}_{1}}={{d}_{2}}$. Wherein $d$ doesn't have to be a quadratic residue. Therefore the condition $(\frac{d}{p})=-1$ of theorem is met.
\end{proof}

The previous theorem can be proven for group $SL_2 (F_p)$  also in following way using finite field equations.
The following proof works only for  finite field $F_p$ .
\begin{rem}
%(Theorem 2.)
 If the matrix $A \in SL_2 (F_p)$   is semisimple and diagonalizable over $F_p$  and $(\frac{{{\lambda }_{1}}}{p}) = (\frac{{{\lambda }_{2}}}{p}) = -1$, then  for $\sqrt{A} \in SL_2 (F_p)$, it is necessary and sufficient that $A$ be similar to scalar matrix.
\end{rem}

\begin{proof}   Let according to condition both e.v. $(\frac{{{\lambda }_{1}}}{p}) = (\frac{{{\lambda }_{2}}}{p}) = -1$  but ${\lambda }_{1} \neq {\lambda }_{2}$.

 If we assume, that  equation $X^2=A$ is solvable over $F_p$  then e.v. $\beta_1, \beta_2$  of $B$  are such that $\beta_1, \beta_2 \in \{ F_{p^2} \backslash F_p \}$
because of $\lambda $ is non-square over $F_p$. Since we assume existing of root from $A \in SL_2 (F_p)$, then    $tr(B)=\beta_1+\beta_2$. Consider expression $\beta_1$  by trace $\beta_1= tr(B)-\beta_2$   then its square $\beta_1^2= (tr(B) + \beta_2)^2$  give us  $\beta_1^2=(tr(B))^2 -2tr(B)\beta_2 - \beta_2^2$. In the LHS of the equality we have that $\beta_1^2 \in F_p$   because $\beta_1$   is a root from the element $\lambda_1 \in F_p$. But in RHS $(tr(B))^2-2t\beta_2+\beta^2_2 \in F_p $ iff $tr(B)=0$  because of  $\beta_1, \beta_2 \in \{ F_p^2 \backslash F_p \} $ and $p>2$ as root from $\alpha_2$  which is not square in $F_p$. But we assume that $B$ is an arbitrary diagonal matrix over $F_p$ that means $tr(B)\neq 0$. The obtained contradiction follows from our assumption that $A$ is not scalar matrix.
\end{proof}

%Recall the following property about verbal width of commutator %subgroup $G{'}$.
%\begin{lem} \label{G^2}  The commutator subgroup is subgroup of %$G^{2}$  i.e. $G{'}<G^{2}$.
%\end{lem}

%Indeed, an arbitrary commutator presented as product of squares. %Let $a,\,\,b\in G$ and set that
%$x=a,\,\,\,y={{a}^{-1}}ba,\,\,\,z={{a}^{-1}}{{b}^{-1}}$ then %${{x}^{2}}{{y}^{2}}{{z}^{2}}={{a}^{2}}{{({{a}^{-1}}ba)}^{2}}%{{({{a}^{-1}}{{b}^{-1}})}^{2}}=ab{{a}^{-1}}{{b}^{-1}},\,\,$
%in more detaile:
%${{a}^{2}}{{({{a}^{-1}}ba)}^{2}}{{({{a}^{-1}}{{b}^{-1}})}^{2}}={{a}^{2}}{{a}^{-1}}ba\,{{a}^{-1}}ba\,\,{{a}^{-1}}{{b}^{-1}}{{a}^{-1}}{{b}^{-1}}=abb{{b}^{-1}}{{a}^{-1}}{{b}^{-1}}=\left[ a,b \right]$.
%In such way we obtain all commutators and their products.
%Thus, we generate by squares whole $G{{'}_{k}}$.

%\textbf{Corollary.}
%Let group $H$ has commutator width 1. If $H^2$ forms subgroup in $G$, then verbal width by square is 1 as well.

%\begin{cor}
% If ${{G}^{2}}$ does not form subgroup in $G$ then verbal width by square is $\infty$.
% If ${{G}^{2}}$ generates $G$ then $vw(G)$ is no grater then 3.
%\end{cor}
%If group $H$  has commutator width 1 then  due to inclusion $H{{'}}<H^{2}$ that was  mentioned above every commutator is equal %to one square. But ${{H}^{2}}$ forms proper subgroup of $G$ in an abelian group.
%In case ${{H}^{2}}$ does not form subgroup in $G$ then verbal width of $g\in PS{{L}_{n}}({{F}_{p}})\,$ due to previous Lemma %about verbal width of commutator subgroup and already proved hypotheses  of Ore \cite{Ore} is no grater then 3.


%\begin{prop}
%The following Mathieu's groups ${M}_{11}$, ${M}_{12}$, $M_{20}$, ${M}_{21}$ $M_{22}$, $M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$ have verbal width $(wid(G, S(G)))$ by square 2.
%\end{prop}

%\begin{proof}
%Due to the exceptional  isomorphism ${{M}_{21}}\simeq PSL\left( 3,\text{ }4 \right)$  \cite{Doc}  we  can investigate prime group  $PSL\left( 3,\,4 \right)$. As well as the set  $S(PSL\left( 3,\,4 \right))$ generates whole group $PSL\left( 3,\,4 \right)$  the question  of verbal width remains relevant.  According to Lemma \ref{G^2} and previous Corollary it bounded by 3. The computation on GAP system give us answer $vw(M_{21})=2$.  The exceptional isomorphisms ${{M}_{12}}\simeq PSL\left( 2,\text{ 11} \right)$ and ${{M}_{21}}\simeq PSL\left( 3,\text{ }4 \right)$ gives us the possibility to investigate well known matrix group from $PSL\left( k,\text{ }n \right)$ and obtain result $vw(M_{12},S(M_{12}))=2$, $vw(M_{12},S(M_{21}))=2$ in analytical way. For verifying the verbal width for the rest of groups algebraic system GAP was applied.
%\end{proof}

%This yields the \textbf{assumption} that verbal width by set of squares of elements of $M_{22}$, $M_{23}$ and $M_{24}$ is 2.











\section{Conclusion }

The the analytical formula of square roots in $ SL_2({\mathbb{F}_p})$, $ ESL_2({\mathbb{F}_p})$, for any prime $p$,  as well as in $ SL_2({Z})$  $ ESL_2({Z})$ and in $ SL_2({k}), ESL_2({k})$, where $k$ is arbitrary perfect field, is found by us.

New linear group which is storage of square roots from $ SL_2({\mathbb{F}_p})$ is found and investigated by us.

The criterions of solvability of matrix equation $X^2=A$ over different linear groups according of matrix classification according its $tr(A)$ and type of space contracting is found and proved in this paper.

The criterion of roots existing for different classes of matrix --- simple and semisimple matrixes from $ SL_2({\mathbb{F}_p})$, $ SL_2({\mathbb{Z}})$ are established.

If a matrix $A\in G{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ is semisimple with different eigenvalues and at least one an eigenvalue ${{\lambda }_{i}} \in F_{p^2} \setminus F_{p} $, $ i\in \{1,2\}$, then $\sqrt{A}\in G{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ iff $A$ satisfies:

 \begin{equation*}
(\frac{{{\lambda }_{i}}}{p})=1
 \, \, in \, \, the \, \, algebraic \, \, extention \, \, of \, \, degree \, \, 2 \, \, that \, \, is \, \, {{F}_{p^2}}.
 \end{equation*}

%If a matrix $A\in G{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ is semisimple with different eigenvalues but with the same quadraticity, then $\sqrt{A}\in G{{L}_{2}}({{F}_{p}})$ iff at least one an eigenvalue ${{\lambda }_{i}}$, $ i\in \{1,2\}$  of $A$ satisfies:

% \begin{equation*}
%(\frac{{{\lambda }_{i}}}{p})=1
% \, \, in \, \, the \, \, algebraic \, \, extention \, \, of \, \, degree \, \, 2 \, \, that \, \, is \, \, {{F}_{p^2}}.
% \end{equation*}

%
%
%Verbal width by $S(A_{n})$ of the group $ A_{n} $ equals to $2$ for $n>4$.
