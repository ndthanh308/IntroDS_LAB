  "abstract": "In this paper we consider a one dimensional elastic system with double porosity structure and with frictional damping in both porous equations. We introduce two stability numbers $χ_{0}$ and $χ_{1}$ and prove that the solution of the system decays exponentially provided that $χ_{0}=0$ and $χ_{1}\\neq0.$ Otherwise, we prove the lack of exponential decay. Our results improve the results of \\cite{Bazarra} and \\cite{Nemsi}.",
