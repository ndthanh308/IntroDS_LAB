  "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the cohomology rings of some multiple weight varieties of type A, that is, symplectic torus quotients for a direct product of several coadjoint orbits of the special unitary group. Under some specific assumptions, we prove the symplectic volumes of multiple weight varieties are equal to the volumes of flow polytopes. Using differential equations satisfied by the volume functions of flow polytopes, we give an explicit presentation of the cohomology ring of the multiple weight variety of special type.",
