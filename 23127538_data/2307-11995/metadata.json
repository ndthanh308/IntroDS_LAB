  "abstract": "Super-Bloch oscillations(SBOs) is giant Bloch oscillations (BOs) when applying both static and periodically driving force to free atoms in lattice at the condition that Bloch oscillations are close to integer times of driving frequencies. Rather than observe SBOs in real space, this paper presents a method to observe it using Rabi spectroscopy of Optical lattice clock(OLC). An effective model of OLC with atoms been added both static and time-periodical forces is derived. Based on that, we propose an experimental scheme and give the Rabi spectrum under lab achievable parameters. Utilizing the precision spectroscopy of OLC, force with a large range could be accurately measured by measuring the Period of SBOs. We also gave the best parameter condition of measuring gravity by calculating Fisher information. Our work paves the way to study other exotic dynamics behaviors in Floquet driving OLC.",
