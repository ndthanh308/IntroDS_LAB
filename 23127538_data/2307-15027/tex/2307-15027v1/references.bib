An integral aspect of the modern Internet that enables individual and collective psychological decision-making to coexist. The ecosystems in Dynamic Open Source Tools ({DOST}) are growing worldwide. {DOST} refers to groups of programs allowing the software to be used openly and exchange code by software’s general and business users on Internet governance. A broad controversy has emerged between researchers and policymakers, with the mixture of pri­ vate access, public information, software and the emergence of economic and social paradoxes on psychological perspectives. This article examines {DOST} societies from “intrinsic drive,” information growth and mutual Internet governance. The implication of business ethics and global Internet regulation has been analyzed in this research.},

When online communities desire other forms of government, such as ones that take many members’ opinions into account or that distribute power in non-trivial ways, communities must resort to laborious manual effort. In this paper, we present {PolicyKit}, a software infrastructure that empowers online community members to concisely author a wide range of governance procedures and automatically carry out those procedures on their home platforms. We draw on political science theory to encode community governance into policies, or short imperative functions that specify a procedure for determining whether a user-initiated action can execute. Actions that can be governed by policies encompass everyday activities such as posting or moderating a message, but actions can also encompass changes to the policies themselves, enabling the evolution of governance over time. We demonstrate the expressivity of {PolicyKit} through implementations of governance models such as a random jury deliberation, a multi-stage caucus, a reputation system, and a promotion procedure inspired by Wikipedia’s Request for Adminship ({RfA}) process.},

Drawing inspiration from constitutional jury trials in many legal systems, this paper proposes digital juries as a civics-oriented approach for adjudicating content moderation cases. Building on existing theoretical models of jury decision-making, we outline a 5-stage model characterizing the space of design considerations in a digital jury process. We implement two examples of jury designs involving blind-voting and deliberation. From users who participate in our jury implementations, we gather informed judgments of the democratic legitimacy of a jury process for content moderation. We ﬁnd that digital juries are perceived as more procedurally just than existing common platform moderation practices, but also ﬁnd disagreement over whether jury decisions should be enforced or used as recommendations.},

Peer-to-peer architectures are characterized by their ability to adapt to failures and accommodate transient populations of nodes while maintaining acceptable connectivity and performance.Content distribution is an important peer-to-peer application on the Internet that has received considerable research attention. Content distribution applications typically allow personal computers to function in a coordinated manner as a distributed storage medium by contributing, searching, and obtaining digital content.In this survey, we propose a framework for analyzing peer-to-peer content distribution technologies. Our approach focuses on nonfunctional characteristics such as security, scalability, performance, fairness, and resource management potential, and examines the way in which these characteristics are reflected in---and affected by---the architectural design decisions adopted by current peer-to-peer systems.We study current peer-to-peer systems and infrastructure technologies in terms of their distributed object location and routing mechanisms, their approach to content replication, caching and migration, their support for encryption, access control, authentication and identity, anonymity, deniability, accountability and reputation, and their use of resource trading and management schemes.},

	abstract = {Platform desertion, or a developer’s stopping the development of an app for a platform, is a widespread phenomenon to the detriment of platforms. However, the extant literature focuses primarily on why app developers join—not leave—a platform. This app-level study develops two ideas: (a) coordination costs borne by an app’s developer are associated with platform desertion, and (b) these costs are, in turn, shaped by a nuanced interplay between app decision rights and app “microarchitecture” introduced here. We use survey and snapshot archival data spanning 2009–2014 on over 300 apps in the Mozilla Firefox ecosystem to test these ideas. Our novel contribution shows how, by influencing coordination costs, the previously invisible interplay between app decision rights and app microarchitecture shapes an app’s platform desertion. We find that delegating app decision rights to its developer weakens the coordination cost-reducing benefits of decoupling an app from the platform but strengthens those of standardizing its interfaces to the platform. The key theoretical implication is that app decision rights and app microarchitecture symbiotically influence the coordination costs borne by an app’s developer. The key practical implication for platform designers is that the choices about who ought to make what decisions are intertwined with the architecture of the governed information technology artifact.},

	abstract = {We look for necessary properties of shareholder-value maximizing corporate boards when shareholders face a trade-o¤ between improving information sharing between the board and management and reducing distortions in decision-making arising out of managerial agency. We draw a distinction between the alignment of preferences of the board with management (which a¤ects information ‡ows) and the allocation of authority to the board or management (which a¤ects ex-post decisions). We show that it is in general suboptimal to allocate authority to management. Authority should be held by a supervisory board that may be imperfectly aligned with both shareholders and management. Indeed, even when management has captured all authority and the board only has an advisory role, the optimal board may be designed to withold information from management. An optimal advisory board must however be su¢ ciently aligned with management in order to create ex-post consensus and ensure authority is irrelevant. Given optimal board alignment, the value of the board’s authority equals the cost of requiring consensus. Shareholders may hold ultimate decision-making authority within an optimal supervisory board without any loss in welfare and in many cases this is strictly optimal.},

Instead, a market for transaction-processing determines the fees users pay to gain priority and avoid transaction-processing delays.

	abstract = {Bitcoin, a distributed, peer to peer crypto currency, has gained a signiﬁcant popularity among different users around the world by promising users a fully decentralized network with an inherently independence from governments and without the inﬂuence of any central authorities and organizations. Mining is the fundamental concept in Bitcoin which must be done in checking all monetary transactions and verifying them which in return generates Bitcoin as a reward to encourage this work. While the qualitative nature of this unique system is clearly accepted and understood, there are some issues regarding to its decentralized network environment. Based on our analysis due to the high variance of solo mining, the number of users joining top most famous Bitcoin mining pools are increasing due to the fact that users together under a Bitcoin pool will have a higher chance of generating next block in the Bitcoin’s blockchain by reducing the variance and earning the mining reward. Furthermore, emerging huge mining farms with strong mining resources and fast processing power is another trend toward centralization. Although some might argue that, the protocol itself is purely decentralized and these are marketbased centralization, this trend clearly illustrates that the pure, decentralized protocol of Bitcoin is going toward centralization in its distributed network, where any kind of centralization should be considered carefully due to the 51\% attack. By analysing all the created blocks from 2009 to 2014 we proposed a centralization factor which shows how centralized is the state of Bitcoin’s network in different years. Centralization, due its simplicity, is a phenomenon that happens to any disciplined and organized system automatically, which in case of Bitcoin is against the pure initial decentralized nature of it and might arise some concerns and threats to the Bitcoin’s unforeseeable future.},

First, we characterize statistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions, show that traders typically specialize on {NFTs} associated with similar objects and form tight clusters with other traders that exchange the same kind of objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to {NFTs} according to their visual features and show that collections contain visually homogeneous objects. Finally, we investigate the predictability of {NFT} sales using simple machine learning algorithms and find that sale history and, secondarily, visual features are good predictors for price. We anticipate that these findings will stimulate further research on {NFT} production, adoption, and trading in different contexts.},

We reveal that the fraction of papers on the topic has been exponentially increasing since the 1950s, with 1 author in 154 contributing to a paper on (de)centralization in 2021. We then cluster papers using both semantic and citation information and show that the topic has independently emerged in diﬀerent ﬁelds, while cross-disciplinary contamination started only more recently. Finally, focusing on the two most prominent clusters by number of papers and inﬂuence, we show how Blockchain has become the most inﬂuential ﬁeld about 10 years ago, while Governance dominated before the 1990s, and we characterize their interactions with other ﬁelds. Our results add a quantitative dimension to the history of a key yet elusive concept. Furthermore, the introduced framework is general and our publicly released pipeline may be used to run similar analyses on other concepts in the academic literature.},

	abstract = {Internet has completely evolved in recent years, and smart devices, such as mobile and {IoT} devices have become pervasive in the daily life of people. Internet is becoming more social, and Online Social Networking platforms ({OSNs}) have become part of the real life of people. Current Online Social Media platforms are centralized. Centralization presents several drawbacks, and during the last years several privacy issues have been arisen concerning the control of private data. Indeed, those platforms offer inadequate guarantees where it concerns the privacy of their users. These problems have been confronted by exploiting decentralized solutions. Decentralized Online Social Networks ({DOSNs}) guarantee more control over private data. Thanks to the definition of a Next Generation Internet focused on people, the need for a new generation of Decentralized Online Social Networks, which puts the user at the center of the system, has been arisen. The {HELIOS} project tackles this issue by introducing a new decentralized paradigm. In this paper, we present the Contextual Ego Network ({CEN}), a new P2P Social Overlay built by exploiting the real life of users. We propose a formal definition of the structure, the implementation of the structure in a Java library, and a preliminary analysis in order to evaluate the homophily of each context.},

	abstract = {What are “alternative social media”? How can we distinguish alternative social media from mainstream social media? Why are social media alternatives important? How do they work? Why do people make them? What do they tell us about contemporary corporate social media and its related phenomena: surveillance, privacy, power, self-expression, and sociality? This essay answers these questions by theorizing alternative social media. The empirical data for this alternative social media theory are drawn from previous work on alternative sites such as Diaspora, rstat.us, Twister, {GNU} social, and the Dark Web Social Network. These cases are used to build a generalized conceptual framework. However, this article does not solely theorize from these examples, but rather seeks to contextualize and historicize alternative social media theory within larger bodies of work. In addition to generalization from examples, the theory is informed by two threads. The first thread is the work of alternative media scholars such as Nick Couldry, Chris Atton, and Clemencia Rodriguez, who have done the historical and theoretical work to define alternative media. The second thread is a synthesis of works exploring the technical side of contemporary media, coming from new fields such as software studies. The threads and empirical analyses of sites such as Diaspora, Quitter, and rstat.us are combined into a theoretical matrix that can account for the processes and technical infrastructures that comprise social media alternatives and explain why they are distinct from sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google, as well as why they are important.},

These offer alternatives to traditional social networks like Twitter, {YouTube}, and Facebook, by enabling the operation of web infrastructure and services without centralised ownership or control. Although their services differ greatly, modern {DW} platforms mostly rely on two key innovations: first, their open source software allows anybody to setup independent servers (“instances”) that people can sign-up to and use within a local community; and second, they build on top of federation protocols so that instances can mesh together, in a peer-to-peer fashion, to offer a globally integrated platform.},

In {DOSNs}, users can set up their own server, or instance, while they can actually interact with users of other instances. Moreover, by adopting the same communication protocol, {DOSNs} become part of a massive social network, namely the Fediverse. Mastodon is the most relevant platform in the Fediverse to date, and also the one that has attracted attention from the research community. Existing studies are however limited to an analysis of a relatively outdated sample of Mastodon focusing on few aspects at a user level, while several open questions have not been answered yet, especially at the instance level.},

	abstract = {Decentralized Online Social Networks ({DOSNs}) represent a growing trend in the social media landscape, as opposed to the well-known centralized peers, which are often in the spotlight due to privacy concerns and a vision typically focused on monetization through user relationships. By exploiting open-source software, {DOSNs} allow users to create their own servers, or instances, thus favoring the proliferation of platforms that are independent yet interconnected with each other in a transparent way. Nonetheless, the resulting cooperation model, commonly known as the Fediverse, still represents a world to be fully discovered, since existing studies have mainly focused on a limited number of structural aspects of interest in {DOSNs}. In this work, we aim to ﬁll a lack of study on user relations and roles in {DOSNs}, by taking two main actions: understanding the impact of decentralization on how users relate to each other within their membership instance and/or across diﬀerent instances, and unveiling user roles that can explain two interrelated axes of social behavioral phenomena, namely information consumption and boundary spanning. To this purpose, we build our analysis on user networks from Mastodon, since it represents the most widely used {DOSN} platform.},
