\opening{Dear Editor,}

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "Predicting Pedestrian Trajectories at Different Densities: A Multi-Criteria Empirical Analysis" for consideration for publication in \emph{Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications}. This research paper presents an empirical analysis of traditional physics-based models and deep learning algorithms in predicting pedestrian trajectories. By comparing these prediction models across three different evaluation metrics, our study provides a comprehensive review of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. 

We believe this manuscript will be of particular interest to the readers of Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications as it explores the challenges of predicting  and simulating pedestrian trajectories. The findings from our study provide valuable insights for further research and development in this field, and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of pedestrian trajectory predictions under various densities.


\noindent We consider suitable the following reviewers:\def\sl{\vspace{-.5mm}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Jun Zhang (University of Science and Technology of China)\sl
    \item Giuseppe Vizzari (University of Milano-Bicoccay)\sl

\end{itemize}
and would not like excluding any referees from reviewing.
