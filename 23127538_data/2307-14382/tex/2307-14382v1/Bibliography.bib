ABSTRACT = {Driven by the recent technological advancements within the field of artificial intelligence research, deep learning has emerged as a promising representation learning technique across all of the machine learning classes, especially within the reinforcement learning arena. This new direction has given rise to the evolution of a new technological domain named deep reinforcement learning, which combines the representational learning power of deep learning with existing reinforcement learning methods. Undoubtedly, the inception of deep reinforcement learning has played a vital role in optimizing the performance of reinforcement learning-based intelligent agents with model-free based approaches. Although these methods could improve the performance of agents to a greater extent, they were mainly limited to systems that adopted reinforcement learning algorithms focused on learning a single task. At the same moment, the aforementioned approach was found to be relatively data-inefficient, particularly when reinforcement learning agents needed to interact with more complex and rich data environments. This is primarily due to the limited applicability of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to many scenarios across related tasks from the same environment. The objective of this paper is to survey the research challenges associated with multi-tasking within the deep reinforcement arena and present the state-of-the-art approaches by comparing and contrasting recent solutions, namely DISTRAL (DIStill &amp; TRAnsfer Learning), IMPALA(Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture) and PopArt that aim to address core challenges such as scalability, distraction dilemma, partial observability, catastrophic forgetting and negative knowledge transfer.},

ABSTRACT = {Driven by progress in deep learning, the machine learning community is now able to tackle increasingly more complex problems—ranging from multi-modal reasoning to dexterous robotic manipulation—all of which typically involve solving nontrivial combinations of tasks. Thus, designing adaptive models and algorithms that can efficiently learn, master, and combine multiple tasks is the next frontier. AMTL workshop aims to bring together machine learning researchers from areas ranging from theory to applications and systems, to explore and discuss:

* advantages, disadvantages, and applicability of different approaches to learning in multitask settings,
* formal or intuitive connections between methods developed for different problems that help better understand the landscape of multitask learning techniques and inspire technique transfer between research lines,
* fundamental challenges and open questions that the community needs to tackle for the field to move forward.},

ABSTRACT={Recently, multi-task learning (MTL) has been extensively studied for various face processing tasks, including face detection, landmark localization, pose estimation, and gender recognition. This approach endeavors to train a better model by exploiting the synergy among the related tasks. However, the raw face dataset used for training often contains sensitive and private information, which can be maliciously recovered by carefully analyzing the model and outputs. To address this problem, we propose a novel privacy-preserving multi-task learning approach that utilizes the differential private stochastic gradient descent algorithm to optimize the end-to-end multi-task model and weighs the loss functions of multiple tasks to improve learning efficiency and prediction accuracy. Specifically, calibrated noise is added to the gradient of loss functions to preserve the privacy of the training data during model training. Furthermore, we exploit the homoscedastic uncertainty to balance different learning tasks. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach yields differential privacy guarantees without decreasing the accuracy of HyperFace under a desirable privacy budget.}

In addition to improper grammatical structures, it contains spelling inconsistencies and numerous informal abbreviations. We propose a novel multi-task approach by employing a more general secondary task of Named Entity (NE) segmentation together with the primary task of fine-grained NE categorization. The multi-task neural network architecture learns higher order feature representations from word and character sequences along with basic Part-of-Speech tags and gazetteer information. This neural network acts as a feature extractor to feed a Conditional Random Fields classifier. We were able to obtain the first position in the 3rd Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (WNUT-2017) with a 41.86{\%} entity F1-score and a 40.24{\%} surface F1-score.",

We also show that pairwise MTL can inform us what tasks can benefit others or what tasks can be benefited if they are learned jointly. In particular, we identify tasks that can always benefit others as well as tasks that can always be harmed by others. Interestingly, one of our MTL approaches yields embeddings of the tasks that reveal the natural clustering of semantic and syntactic tasks.

ABSTRACT = {The automatic analysis of endoscopic images to assist endoscopists in accurately identifying the types and locations of esophageal lesions remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task deep learning model for automatic diagnosis, which does not simply replace the role of endoscopists in decision making, because endoscopists are expected to correct the false results predicted by the diagnosis system if more supporting information is provided. In order to help endoscopists improve the diagnosis accuracy in identifying the types of lesions, an image retrieval module is added in the classification task to provide an additional confidence level of the predicted types of esophageal lesions. In addition, a mutual attention module is added in the segmentation task to improve its performance in determining the locations of esophageal lesions. The proposed model is evaluated and compared with other deep learning models using a dataset of 1003 endoscopic images, including 290 esophageal cancer, 473 esophagitis, and 240 normal. The experimental results show the promising performance of our model with a high accuracy of 96.76% for the classification and a Dice coefficient of 82.47% for the segmentation. Consequently, the proposed multi-task deep learning model can be an effective tool to help endoscopists in judging esophageal lesions.},

These methods first specifically identify a set of users that are closely related to the user under consideration (i.e., active user), and then learn multiple rating prediction models simultaneously, one for the active user and one for each of the related users. Such learning for multiple models (tasks) in parallel is implemented by representing all learning instances (users and items) using a coupled user-item representation, and within error-insensitive Support Vector Regression ($\epsilon$-SVR) framework applying multi-task kernel tricks. A comprehensive set of experiments shows that multi-task learning approaches lead to significant performance improvement over conventional alternatives.}

 abstract = {Meinshausen and Buhlmann [Ann. Statist. 34 (2006) 1436-1462] showed that, for neighborhood selection in Gaussian graphical models, under a neighborhood stability condition, the LASSO is consistent, even when the number of variables is of greater order than the sample size. Zhao and Yu [(2006) J. Machine Learning Research 7 2541-2567] formalized the neighborhood stability condition in the context of linear regression as a strong irrepresentable condition. That paper showed that under this condition, the LASSO selects exactly the set of nonzero regression coefficients, provided that these coefficients are bounded away from zero at a certain rate. In this paper, the regression coefficients outside an ideal model are assumed to be small, but not necessarily zero. Under a sparse Riesz condition on the correlation of design variables, we prove that the LASSO selects a model of the correct order of dimensionality, controls the bias of the selected model at a level determined by the contributions of small regression coefficients and threshold bias, and selects all coefficients of greater order than the bias of the selected model. Moreover, as a consequence of this rate consistency of the LASSO in model selection, it is proved that the sum of error squares for the mean response and the $\ell _{\alpha}\text{-loss}$ for the regression coefficients converge at the best possible rates under the given conditions. An interesting aspect of our results is that the logarithm of the number of variables can be of the same order as the sample size for certain random dependent designs.},

    abstract = { This survey provides an overview of higher-order tensor decompositions, their applications, and available software. A tensor is a multidimensional or N-way array. Decompositions of higher-order tensors (i.e., N-way arrays with \$N \geq 3\$) have applications in psycho-metrics, chemometrics, signal processing, numerical linear algebra, computer vision, numerical analysis, data mining, neuroscience, graph analysis, and elsewhere. Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox, Tensor Toolbox, and Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for working with tensors. }

Many supervised multi-task learning methods have been proposed, while unsupervised multi-task learning is still a rarely studied problem. In this paper, we propose to learn a kernel for multi-task clustering. Our goal is to learn a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, in which the geometric structure of the data in each task is preserved, while the data distributions of any two tasks are as close as possible. This is formulated as a unified kernel learning framework, under which we study two types of kernel learning: nonparametric kernel learning and spectral kernel design. Both types of kernel learning can be solved by linear programming. Experiments on several cross-domain text data sets demonstrate that kernel k-means on the learned kernel can achieve better clustering results than traditional single-task clustering methods. It also outperforms the newly proposed multi-task clustering method. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Gu, Quanquan and Li, Zhenhui and Han, Jiawei}, year={2011}, month={Aug.}, pages={368-373} }

  abstract = 	 {We provide stronger and more general primal-dual convergence results for Frank-Wolfe-type algorithms (a.k.a. conditional gradient) for constrained convex optimization, enabled by a simple framework of duality gap certificates. Our analysis also holds if the linear subproblems are only solved approximately (as well as if the gradients are inexact), and is proven to be worst-case optimal in the sparsity of the obtained solutions.    On the application side, this allows us to unify a large variety of existing sparse greedy methods, in particular for optimization over convex hulls of an atomic set, even if those sets can only be approximated, including sparse (or structured sparse) vectors or matrices, low-rank matrices, permutation matrices, or max-norm bounded matrices.    We present a new general framework for convex optimization over matrix factorizations, where every Frank-Wolfe iteration will consist of a low-rank update, and discuss the broad application areas of this approach.}

abstract = {One of the most important issues in multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) is finding Pareto optimal points on the Pareto frontier. This topic is one of the oldest challenges in science and engineering. Many important problems in engineering need to solve a non-convex multi-objective optimization problem (NMOP) in order to achieve the proper results. Gradient based methods, such as Normal Boundary Intersection (NBI), for solving a MOP require solving at least one optimization problem for each solution point. This method can be computationally expensive with an increase in the number of variables and/or constraints of the optimization problem. Nevertheless, the NBI method is a technique motivated by geometrical intuition to provide a better parameterization of the Pareto set than that provided by other techniques. This parameterization is better in the sense that the points obtained by using the NBI method produce a more even coverage of the Pareto curve and this coverage does not miss the interesting middle part of the Pareto curve.This useful property, provides an incentive to create a new method. The first step in this study is using a modified convex hull of individual minimum (mCHIM) in each iteration. The second step is introducing an efficient scalarization problem in order to find the Pareto points on the Pareto front. It can be shown that the corresponding solutions of the MOP have uniform spread and also weak Pareto optimal points. It is notable that the NBI and proposed methods are independent of the relative scale of different objective functions. However, it is quite possible that obtaining a solution of the NBI method not be Pareto optimal (not even locally). Actually, this method aims at getting boundary points rather than Pareto optimal points that will lead to these points which may or may not be a Pareto optimal point. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated with various test problems in convex and non-convex MOP cases. After that, a few test instances of the CEC 2009 (Zhang et al. 2008) using the proposed method are studied. Also, the relationship between the optimal solutions of the scalarized problem and the Pareto solutions of the multi-objective optimization problem is presented by several theorems.}

  abstract = 	 {Multi-objective optimization (MOO) and multi-task learning (MTL) have gained much popularity with prevalent use cases such as production model development of regression / classification / ranking models with MOO, and training deep learning models with MTL. Despite the long history of research in MOO, its application to machine learning requires development of solution strategy, and algorithms have recently been developed to solve specific problems such as discovery of any Pareto optimal (PO) solution, and that with a particular form of preference. In this paper, we develop a novel and generic framework to discover a PO solution with multiple forms of preferences. It allows us to formulate a generic MOO / MTL problem to express a preference, which is solved to achieve both alignment with the preference and PO, at the same time. Specifically, we apply the framework to solve the weighted Chebyshev problem and an extension of that. The former is known as a method to discover the Pareto front, the latter helps to find a model that outperforms an existing model with only one run. Experimental results demonstrate not only the method achieves competitive performance with existing methods, but also it allows us to achieve the performance from different forms of preferences.}

A major assumption for this paradigm is that all those tasks are indeed related so that the joint training is appropriate and beneficial. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-task learning of shared feature representations among tasks, while simultaneously determining "with whom" each task should share. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer programming and provide an alternating minimization technique to solve the optimization problem of jointly identifying grouping structures and parameters. The algorithm mono-tonically decreases the objective function and converges to a local optimum. Compared to the standard MTL paradigm where all tasks are in a single group, our algorithm improves its performance with statistical significance for three out of the four datasets we have studied. We also demonstrate its advantage over other task grouping techniques investigated in literature.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on International Conference on Machine Learning}, pages = {521–528}, numpages = {8}, location = {Bellevue, Washington, USA}, series = {ICML'11} }

Since deep features eventually transition from general to specific along deep networks, a fundamental problem of multi-task learning is how to exploit the task relatedness underlying parameter tensors and improve feature transferability in the multiple task-specific layers. This paper presents Multilinear Relationship Networks (MRN) that discover the task relationships based on novel tensor normal priors over parameter tensors of multiple task-specific layers in deep convolutional networks. By jointly learning transferable features and multilinear relationships of tasks and features, MRN is able to alleviate the dilemma of negative-transfer in the feature layers and under-transfer in the classifier layer. Experiments show that MRN yields state-of-the-art results on three multi-task learning datasets.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems}, pages = {1593–1602}, numpages = {10}, location = {Long Beach, California, USA}, series = {NIPS'17} }

ABSTRACT = {Morphological and functional changes in retinal vessels are indicators of a variety of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, stroke, and hypertension. However, without a large number of high-quality annotations, existing deep learning-based medical image segmentation approaches may degrade their performance dramatically on the retinal vessel segmentation task. To reduce the demand of high-quality annotations and make full use of massive unlabeled data, we propose a self-supervised multi-task strategy to extract curvilinear vessel features for the retinal vessel segmentation task. Specifically, we use a dense network to extract more vessel features across different layers/slices, which is elaborately designed for hardware to train and test efficiently. Then, we combine three general pre-training tasks (i.e., intensity transformation, random pixel filling, in-painting and out-painting) in an aggregated way to learn rich hierarchical representations of curvilinear retinal vessel structures. Furthermore, a vector classification task module is introduced as another pre-training task to obtain more spatial features. Finally, to make the segmentation network pay more attention to curvilinear structures, a novel dynamic loss is proposed to learn robust vessel details from unlabeled fundus images. These four pre-training tasks greatly reduce the reliance on labeled data. Moreover, our network can learn the retinal vessel features effectively in the pre-training process, which leads to better performance in the target multi-modal segmentation task. Experimental results show that our method provides a promising direction for the retinal vessel segmentation task. Compared with other state-of-the-art supervised deep learning-based methods applied, our method requires less labeled data and achieves comparable segmentation accuracy. For instance, we match the accuracy of the traditional supervised learning methods on DRIVE and Vampire datasets without needing any labeled ground truth image. With elaborately training, we gain the 0.96 accuracy on DRIVE dataset.},

This task aims at comparing two types of semantic descriptions and including two sub-tasks: the definition modeling and reverse dictionary track. Our team focuses on the reverse dictionary track and adopts the multi-task self-supervised pre-training for multilingual reverse dictionaries. Specifically, the randomly initialized mDeBERTa-base model is used to perform multi-task pre-training on the multilingual training datasets. The pre-training step is divided into two stages, namely the MLM pre-training stage and the contrastive pre-training stage. The experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved good performance in the reverse dictionary track, where we rank the 1-st in the Sgns targets of the EN and RU languages.

abstract="While self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been widely used to pre-train deep models, few efforts [11] have been done to improve representation learning of X-ray image analysis with SSL pre-trained models. In this work, we study a novel self-supervised pre-training pipeline, namely Multi-task Self-super-vised Continual Learning (MUSCLE), for multiple medical imaging tasks, such as classification and segmentation, using X-ray images collected from multiple body parts, including heads, lungs, and bones. Specifically, MUSCLE aggregates X-rays collected from multiple body parts for MoCo-based representation learning, and adopts a well-designed continual learning (CL) procedure to further pre-train the backbone subject various X-ray analysis tasks jointly. Certain strategies for image pre-processing, learning schedules, and regularization have been used to solve data heterogeneity, over-fitting, and catastrophic forgetting problems for multi-task/dataset learning in MUSCLE. We evaluate MUSCLE using 9 real-world X-ray datasets with various tasks, including pneumonia classification, skeletal abnormality classification, lung segmentation, and tuberculosis (TB) detection. Comparisons against other pre-trained models [7] confirm the proof-of-concept that self-supervised multi-task/dataset continual pre-training could boost the performance of X-ray image analysis.",

Specifically, we demonstrate that models with transformer structures are more appropriate for MTL than convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and we propose a novel transformer-based architecture named MTFormer for MTL. In the framework, multiple tasks share the same transformer encoder and transformer decoder, and lightweight branches are introduced to harvest task-specific outputs, which increases the MTL performance and reduces the time-space complexity. Furthermore, information from different task domains can benefit each other, and we conduct cross-task reasoning. We propose a cross-task attention mechanism for further boosting the MTL results. The cross-task attention mechanism brings little parameters and computations while introducing extra performance improvements. Besides, we design a self-supervised cross-task contrastive learning algorithm for further boosting the MTL performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on two multi-task learning datasets, on which MTFormer achieves state-of-the-art results with limited network parameters and computations. It also demonstrates significant superiorities for few-shot learning and zero-shot learning.}, booktitle = {Computer Vision – ECCV 2022: 17th European Conference, Tel Aviv, Israel, October 23–27, 2022, Proceedings, Part XXVII}, pages = {304–321}, numpages = {18}, keywords = {Transformer, Cross-task reasoning, Multi-task learning}, location = {Tel Aviv, Israel} }
