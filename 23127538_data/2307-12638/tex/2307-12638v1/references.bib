Rev. 109 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.109.1492] 1492–505 ; Abrahams et al 1979 Phys. Rev. Lett. 42 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.42.673] 673–6 ). In ‘ The question of classical localization: a theory of white paint? ’ Anderson suggested the possibility to observe light localization in TiO 2 samples (Anderson 1985 Phil. Mag. B 52 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13642818508240619] 505–9 ). We recently claimed the observation of localization effects measuring photon time of flight (ToF) distributions (Störzer et al 2006 Phys. Rev. Lett. 96 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.063904] 063904 ) and evaluating transmission profiles (TPs) (Sperling et al 2013 Nat. Photonics 7 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphoton.2012.313] 48–52 ) in such TiO 2 samples. Here we present a careful study of the long time tail of ToF distributions and the long time behavior of the TP width for very thin samples and different turbidities that questions the localization interpretation. We further show new data that allow an alternative consistent explanation of these previous data by a fluorescence process. An adapted diffusion model including an appropriate exponential fluorescence decay accounts for the shape of the ToF distributions and the TP width. These observations question whether the strong localization regime can be reached with visible light scattering in polydisperse TiO 2 samples, since the disorder parameter can hardly be increased any further in such a ‘white paint’ material.},

  abstract = {Disordered dielectric materials with structural correlations show unconventional optical behavior: They can be transparent to long-wavelength radiation, while at the same time have isotropic band gaps in another frequency range. This phenomenon raises fundamental questions concerning photon transport through disordered media. While optical transparency in these materials is robust against recurrent multiple scattering, little is known about other transport regimes like diffusive multiple scattering or Anderson localization. Here, we investigate band gaps, and we report Anderson localization in 2D disordered dielectric structures using numerical simulations of the density of states and optical transport statistics. The disordered structures are designed with different levels of positional correlation encoded by the degree of stealthiness χ. To establish a unified view, we propose a correlation-frequency (χ–ν) transport phase diagram. Our results show that, depending only on χ, a dielectric material can transition from localization behavior to a band gap crossing an intermediate regime dominated by tunneling between weakly coupled states.},

The question about its existence in open three-dimensional materials has eluded an experimental and full theoretical verification for decades. Here we study numerically electromagnetic vector wave transmittance through realistic digital representations of hyperuniform dielectric networks, a new class of highly correlated but disordered photonic band gap materials. We identify the evanescent decay of the transmitted power in the gap and diffusive transport far from the gap. Near the gap, we find that transport sets off diffusive but, with increasing slab thickness, crosses over gradually to a faster decay, signaling localization. We show that we can describe the transition to localization at the mobility edge using the self-consistent theory of localization based on the concept of a position-dependent diffusion coefficient.},

Here, we extend the reach of fractal concepts in photonics by experimentally demonstrating multifractality of light in arrays of dielectric nanoparticles that are based on fundamental structures of algebraic number theory. Specifically, we engineered novel deterministic photonic platforms based on the aperiodic distributions of primes and irreducible elements in complex quadratic and quaternions rings. Our findings stimulate fundamental questions on the nature of transport and localization of wave excitations in deterministic media with multi-scale fluctuations beyond what is possible in traditional fractal systems. Moreover, our approach establishes structure-property relationships that can readily be transferred to planar semiconductor electronics and to artificial atomic lattices, enabling the exploration of novel quantum phases and many-body effects.},

However, deviations from periodicity may result in higher complexity and give rise to a number of surprising effects. One such deviation can be found in the field of optics in the realization of photonic quasicrystals, a class of structures made from building blocks that are arranged using well-designed patterns but lack translational symmetry. Nevertheless, these structures, which lie between periodic and disordered structures, still show sharp diffraction patterns that confirm the existence of wave interference resulting from their long-range order. In this Review, we discuss the beautiful physics unravelled in photonic quasicrystals of one, two and three dimensions, and describe how they can influence optical transmission and reflectivity, photoluminescence, light transport, plasmonics and laser action.},

General engineering trends for optimized Vogel structures with varying numbers of particles are obtained for each material. The optimization strategy demonstrated in this work enables rapid prototyping of large-scale photonic-plasmonic coupled devices composed of a large number of small resonant nanoparticles, and can be utilized for the optimal design of plasmon-enhanced optical sensors, photodetectors, solar cells, and enhanced-efficiency light sources, and nonlinear optical components.},

This model suffices to unveil the fundamental mathematical structure of their complex Fraunhofer diffraction patterns and enables the engineering of optical beams carrying multiple values of orbital angular momentum (OAM). By performing analytical Fourier-Hankel decomposition of spiral arrays and far field patterns, we rigorously demonstrate the ability to encode specific numerical sequences onto the OAM values of diffracted optical beams. In particular, we show that these OAM values are determined by the rational approximations (i.e., the convergents) of the continued fraction expansions of the irrational angles utilized to generate Vogel spirals. These findings open novel and exciting opportunities for the manipulation of complex OAM spectra using dielectric and plasmonic aperiodic spiral arrays for a number of emerging engineering applications in singular optics, secure communication, optical cryptography, and optical sensing.},

The unique structural characteristics of the golden-angle spiral lead to distinctive features of the band edge modes that are absent in both photonic crystals and quasicrystals.},

abstract = {Abstract This review focuses on the optical properties and device applications of deterministic aperiodic media generated by mathematical rules with spectral features that interpolate in a tunable fashion between periodic crystals and disordered random media. These structures are called Deterministic Aperiodic Nano Structures (DANS) and can be implemented in different materials (linear and nonlinear) and physical systems as diverse as dielectric multilayers, optical gratings, photonic waveguides and nanoparticle arrays. Among their distinctive optical properties are the formation of multi-fractal bandgaps and characteristic optical resonances, called critical modes, with unusual localization, scaling and transport properties. The goal of the paper is to provide a detailed review of the conceptual foundation and the physical mechanisms governing the complex optical response of DANS in relation to the engineering of novel devices and functionalities. The discussion will mostly focus on passive and active planar structures with enhanced light-matter coupling for photonics and plasmonics technologies.},

abstract = {Light scattering phenomena in periodic systems have been investigated for decades in optics and photonics. Their classical description relies on Bragg scattering, which gives rise to constructive interference at specific wavelengths along well defined propagation directions, depending on illumination conditions, structural periodicity, and the refractive index of the surrounding medium. In this paper, by engineering multifrequency colorimetric responses in deterministic aperiodic arrays of nanoparticles, we demonstrate significantly enhanced sensitivity to the presence of a single protein monolayer. These structures, which can be readily fabricated by conventional Electron Beam Lithography, sustain highly complex structural resonances that enable a unique optical sensing approach beyond the traditional Bragg scattering with periodic structures. By combining conventional dark-field scattering micro-spectroscopy and simple image correlation analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that deterministic aperiodic surfaces with engineered structural color are capable of detecting, in the visible spectral range, protein layers with thickness of a few tens of Angstroms.}}

A set of DA and periodic arrays of cylindrical and triangular Au nanoparticles with diameters ranging between 50--110 nm and inter-particle separations between 25--100 nm were fabricated by e-beam lithography on quartz substrates. Using a molecular monolayer of pMA (p-mercaptoaniline) as a Raman reporter, we show that higher values of SERS enhancement factors can be achieved in DA structures compared to their periodic counterparts, and discuss the specific scaling rules of DA arrays with different morphologies. Electromagnetic field calculations based on the semi-analytical generalized Mie theory (GMT) fully support our findings and demonstrate the importance of morphology-dependent diffractive coupling (long-range interactions) for the engineering of the SERS response of DA arrays. Finally, we discuss optimization strategies based on the control of particles sizes and shapes, and we demonstrate that spatially-averaged SERS enhancement factors of the order of ~ 107 can be reproducibly obtained using DA arrays of Au nano-triangles. The ability to rigorously design lithographically fabricated DA arrays of metal nanoparticles enables the optimization and control of highly localized plasmonic fields for a variety of chip-scale devices, such as more reproducible SERS substrates, label-free bio-sensors and non-linear elements for nano-plasmonics.},

abstract = {We present and compare three generically applicable signal processing methods for periodic orbit quantization via harmonic inversion of semiclassical recurrence functions. In a first step of each method, a band-limited decimated periodic orbit signal is obtained by analytical frequency windowing of the periodic orbit sum. In a second step, the frequencies and amplitudes of the decimated signal are determined by either decimated linear predictor, decimated Padé approximant, or decimated signal diagonalization. These techniques, which would have been numerically unstable without the windowing, provide numerically more accurate semiclassical spectra than does the filter diagonalization method.}

  abstract = {Understanding the nature and formation of band gaps associated with the propagation of electromagnetic, electronic, or elastic waves in disordered materials as a function of system size presents fundamental and technological challenges. In particular, a basic question is whether band gaps in disordered systems exist in the thermodynamic limit. To explore this issue, we use a two-stage ensemble approach to study the formation of complete photonic band gaps (PBGs) for a sequence of increasingly large systems spanning a broad range of two-dimensional photonic network solids with varying degrees of local and global order, including hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform types. We discover that the gap in the density of states exhibits exponential tails and the apparent PBGs rapidly close as the system size increases for nearly all disordered networks considered. The only exceptions are sufficiently stealthy hyperuniform cases for which the band gaps remain open and the band tails exhibit a desirable power-law scaling reminiscent of the PBG behavior of photonic crystals in the thermodynamic limit.},

We find that at low stealthiness, where correlations are weak, band gaps of different system realizations appear over a wide frequency range, are narrow, and generally do not overlap. Interestingly, above a critical value of stealthiness $\chi$≳0.35, the bandgaps become large and overlap significantly from realization to realization, while a second gap appears. These observations extend our understanding of photonic bandgaps in disordered systems and provide information on the robustness of gaps in practical applications.},
