  "abstract": "We carry out dynamical microwave transport experiments in aperiodic Vogel spiral arrays of cylinders with high dielectric permittivity. We experimentally disclose the electromagnetic modal structure of these structures in real space showing that they simultaneously support long-lived modes with Gaussian, exponential, and power law spatial decay. This unique modal structure, which cannot be found in traditional periodic or disordered photonic materials, is shown to be at the origin of strong localization in Vogel spirals that survives even in three dimensions. Altogether our results unveil the manifestations of the rich, unprecedented, spatial structure of electromagnetic modes supported by aperiodic photonic systems in wave transport and localization.",
