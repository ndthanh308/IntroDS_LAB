  "abstract": "We study the production of the dimuonium (also known as true muonium) in two and three photon fusion processes in nucleus--nucleus collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies. A new formalism is introduced for the production process and valuable new information is extracted which will be helpful in proposals of future experiments. We explore the phase space constraints, the reaction mechanisms, and how the dimounium decay observables might be jeopardized by other physical processes. We show that the energies available at the large hadron collider at CERN might lead to the first identification of the dimounium in a terrestrial laboratory.",
