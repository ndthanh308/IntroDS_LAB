  "abstract": "We present the notion of continuous controlled K-g-fusion frame in Hilbert space which is the generalization of discrete controlled K-g-fusion frame. We discuss some characterizations of continuous controlled K-g-fusion frame. Relationship between continuous controlled K-g-fusion frame and quotient operator is being studied. Finally, stability of continuous controlled g-fusion frame has been described.",
