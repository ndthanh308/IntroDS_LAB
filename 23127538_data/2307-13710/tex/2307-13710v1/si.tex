% The use of this template is recommended for all ACS journals, and most other journals. 
% If the target journal has its own template, you may use that instead. 
% Otherwise, make life easier for everyone and just stick to this one.
% The main exception is when you are writing for an extremely high impact journal, in which case I may give you different instructions.

\documentclass[manuscript=article]{achemso}
% \documentclass[combined.tex]{subfiles}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\usepackage{float}


% This makes sure that the references have titles. Which is a requirement in many journals and also useful for me to know if you have cited the proper literature.
\setkeys{acs}{usetitle=true}

% The following are the minimum packages you need. You can add others as needed, e.g., longtable.
% The rule is that you keep external packages to a minimum. Do not import esoteric packages, which may cause problems with the journals. 
\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage[version=3]{mhchem}


% If you have a supplementary information, uncomment the lines below. It will allow you to automatically cross-reference the SI.
