A computationally efficient method is presented to generate databases of atomic configurations that contain optimal information on the small-displacement regime of the potential energy surface of bulk crystalline matter. Utilising non-diagonal supercell (Lloyd-Williams and Monserrat 2015               Phys. Rev.               B               92               184301), an automatic process is suggested for               ab initio               data generation. MLIPs were fitted for Al, W, Mg and Si, which very closely reproduce the               ab initio               phonon and elastic properties. The protocol can be easily adapted to other materials and can be inserted in the workflow of any flavour of MLIP generation.},

While most contemporary symmetry-aware models use invariant convolutions and only act on scalars, NequIP employs E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful representation of atomic environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a challenging and diverse set of molecules and materials while exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets. The high data efficiency of the method allows for the construction of accurate potentials using high-order quantum chemical level of theory as reference and enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations over long time scales.},

Deep learning has recently garnered considerable interest in materials predictive tasks with low model errors when dealing with large materials data. However, deep learning models suffer in the small data regime that is common in materials science. Here we develop the AtomSets framework, which utilizes universal compositional and structural descriptors extracted from pre-trained graph network deep learning models with standard multi-layer perceptrons to achieve consistently high model accuracy for both small compositional data ({$<$}400) and large structural data ({$>$}130,000). The AtomSets models show lower errors than the graph network models at small data limits and other non-deep-learning models at large data limits. They also transfer better in a simulated materials discovery process where the targeted materials have property values out of the training data limits. The models require minimal domain knowledge inputs and are free from feature engineering. The presented AtomSets model framework can potentially accelerate machine learning-assisted materials design and discovery with less data restriction.},

  abstract = {The simulation of large-scale systems with complex electron interactions remains one of the greatest challenges for the atomistic modeling of materials. Although classical force-fields often fail to describe the coupling between electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more accurate \textbackslash textit\{ab-initio\} molecular dynamics suffers from computational complexity that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are essential to study many technologically relevant phenomena, such as reactions, ion migrations, phase transformations, and degradation. In this work, we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph neural Network (CHGNet) as a novel machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP), using a graph-neural-network-based force-field to model a universal potential energy surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over 10 years of density functional theory static and relaxation trajectories of \$\textbackslash sim 1.5\$ million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in Li\$\_x\$MnO\$\_2\$, the finite temperature phase diagram for Li\$\_x\$FePO\$\_4\$ and Li diffusion in garnet conductors. We critically analyze the significance of including charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry, and we provide new insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of freedom that can not be observed by previous MLIPs.},

  abstract = {Effectively predicting molecular interactions has the potential to accelerate molecular dynamics by multiple orders of magnitude and thus revolutionize chemical simulations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently shown great successes for this task, overtaking classical methods based on fixed molecular kernels. However, they still appear very limited from a theoretical perspective, since regular GNNs cannot distinguish certain types of graphs. In this work we close this gap between theory and practice. We show that GNNs with directed edge embeddings and two-hop message passing are indeed universal approximators for predictions that are invariant to translation, and equivariant to permutation and rotation. We then leverage these insights and multiple structural improvements to propose the geometric message passing neural network (GemNet). We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed changes in multiple ablation studies. GemNet outperforms previous models on the COLL, MD17, and OC20 datasets by 34\%, 41\%, and 20\%, respectively, and performs especially well on the most challenging molecules. Our implementation is available online.},

Herein, we establish new strategies of tailoring CCCs via a seamless combination of (1) non-equimolar compositional designs and (2) controlling microstructures and interfaces. Using oxide solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries as an exemplar, we validate these new strategies via discovering a new class of compositionally complex perovskite oxides (CCPOs) to show the possibility of improving ionic conductivities beyond the limit of conventional doping. As an example (amongst the 28 CCPOs examined), we demonstrate that the ionic conductivity can be improved by \&gt;60\% in (Li0.375Sr0.4375)(Ta0.375Nb0.375Zr0.125Hf0.125)O3-{$\delta$}, in comparison with the state-of-art (Li0.375Sr0.4375)(Ta0.75Zr0.25)O3-{$\delta$} (LSTZ) baseline, via maintaining comparable electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the ionic conductivity can be improved by another \&gt;70\% via grain boundary (GB) engineering, achieving \&gt;270\% of the LSTZ baseline. This work suggests transformative new strategies for designing and tailoring HECs and CCCs, thereby opening a new window for discovering materials for energy storage and many other applications.},

Active learning (AL) is a powerful tool to iteratively generate diverse data sets. In this approach, the ML model provides an uncertainty estimate along with its prediction for each new atomic configuration. If the uncertainty estimate passes a certain threshold, then the configuration is included in the data set. Here we develop a strategy to more rapidly discover configurations that meaningfully augment the training data set. The approach, uncertainty-driven dynamics for active learning (UDD-AL), modifies the potential energy surface used in molecular dynamics simulations to favor regions of configuration space for which there is large model uncertainty. The performance of UDD-AL is demonstrated for two AL tasks: sampling the conformational space of glycine and sampling the promotion of proton transfer in acetylacetone.

In the well-studied perovskite oxide solid electrolyte, Li                                3                 x                              La                                2/3-                 x                              TiO               3               (LLTO), the ionic conductivity of grain boundaries is about three orders of magnitude lower than that of the bulk. In contrast, the related Li               0.375               Sr               0.4375               Ta               0.75               Zr               0.25               O               3               (LSTZ0.75) perovskite exhibits low grain boundary resistance for reasons yet unknown. Here, we use aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy, along with an active learning moment tensor potential, to reveal the atomic scale structure and composition of LSTZ0.75 grain boundaries. Vibrational electron energy loss spectroscopy is applied for the first time to reveal atomically resolved vibrations at grain boundaries of LSTZ0.75 and to characterize the otherwise unmeasurable Li distribution therein. We find that Li depletion, which is a major reason for the low grain boundary ionic conductivity of LLTO, is absent for the grain boundaries of LSTZ0.75. Instead, the low grain boundary resistivity of LSTZ0.75 is attributed to the formation of a nanoscale defective cubic perovskite interfacial structure that contained abundant vacancies. Our study provides new insights into the atomic scale mechanisms of low grain boundary resistivity.},

Crystalline compounds can be identified by their characteristic diffraction patterns using X-rays, neutrons, and or electrons. An estimated 20,000 X-ray diffractometers and a comparable number of electron microscopes are used daily in materials research and development laboratories for this purpose. Access to crystal structure data is a critical step in solving research and applications problems in materials researches, and these data are of interest to analysts in areas such as materials design, property prediction and compound identification.NIST Crystallographic Data Center, in collaboration with partners all over the world, evaluates and disseminates chemical, physical and crystallographic information published on these materials. NIST Standard Reference Database 3: NIST Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (NIST ICSD) is a comprehensive collection of crystal structure data of nonorganic compounds (including inorganics, ceramics, minerals, pure elements, metals, and intermetallic systems) containing over 210,000 entries and covering the literature from 1913.NIST ICSD includes entries that fall into the following categories: full structure data from experimental refinement or derived from their iso-structural structure types, theoretically predicted structures from computer simulations, as well as partially characterized structures.The NIST ICSD web application provides materials researchers with a user-friendly interface to search the database based on bibliographic information, chemistry, unit cell, space group, experimental settings, mineral name/group and other derived data from expert evaluation. In addition, it also provides users with functions to easily create and examine results from various crystallographic computations, such as reduced cell, bond distance/angle, calculated powder diffraction data, and structure standardization.},

Here we elucidate the complex interplay between segregation, short-range order, and strengthening in the NbMoTaW MPEA through atomistic simulations with a highly accurate machine learning interatomic potential. In the single crystal MPEA, we find greatly reduced anisotropy in the critically resolved shear stress between screw and edge dislocations compared to the elemental metals. In the polycrystalline MPEA, we demonstrate that thermodynamically driven Nb segregation to the grain boundaries (GBs) and W enrichment within the grains intensifies the observed short-range order (SRO). The increased GB stability due to Nb enrichment reduces the von Mises strain, resulting in higher strength than a random solid solution MPEA. These results highlight the need to simultaneously tune GB composition and bulk SRO to tailor the mechanical properties of MPEAs.},

However, ML-based potentials struggle to achieve transferability, i.e., provide consistent accuracy across configurations that differ from those used during training. In order to realize the promise of ML-based potentials, systematic and scalable approaches to generate diverse training sets need to be developed. This work creates a diverse training set for tungsten in an automated manner using an entropy optimization approach. Subsequently, multiple polynomial and neural network potentials are trained on the entropy-optimized dataset. A corresponding set of potentials are trained on an expert-curated dataset for tungsten for comparison. The models trained to the entropy-optimized data exhibited superior transferability compared to the expert-curated models. Furthermore, the models trained to the expert-curated set exhibited a significant decrease in performance when evaluated on out-of-sample configurations.},

We apply this scheme to a Hafnium dioxide (HfO               2               ) dataset generated from a ``melt-quench'' ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) protocol. Our results show that the active learning scheme, with no prior knowledge of the dataset, is able to extract a configuration that reaches the required energy fit tolerance. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed using this active learned GAP model on 6144 atom systems of amorphous and liquid state elucidate the structural properties of HfO               2               with near ab initio precision and quench rates (i.e., 1.0\,K/ps) not accessible via AIMD. The melt and amorphous X-ray structural factors generated from our simulation are in good agreement with experiment. In addition, the calculated diffusion constants are in good agreement with previous ab initio studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Machine learned force fields typically require manual construction of training sets consisting of thousands of first principles calculations, which can result in low training efficiency and unpredictable errors when applied to structures not represented in the training set of the model. This severely limits the practical application of these models in systems with dynamics governed by important rare events, such as chemical reactions and diffusion. We present an adaptive Bayesian inference method for automating the training of interpretable, low-dimensional, and multi-element interatomic force fields using structures drawn on the fly from molecular dynamics simulations. Within an active learning framework, the internal uncertainty of a Gaussian process regression model is used to decide whether to accept the model prediction or to perform a first principles calculation to augment the training set of the model. The method is applied to a range of single- and multi-element systems and shown to achieve a favorable balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, while requiring a minimal amount of ab initio training data. We provide a fully open-source implementation of our method, as well as a procedure to map trained models to computationally efficient tabulated force fields.},

  abstract = {Data-driven interatomic potentials have emerged as a powerful class of surrogate models for \{\textbackslash it ab initio\} potential energy surfaces that are able to reliably predict macroscopic properties with experimental accuracy. In generating accurate and transferable potentials the most time-consuming and arguably most important task is generating the training set, which still requires significant expert user input. To accelerate this process, this work presents \textbackslash text\{\textbackslash it hyperactive learning\} (HAL), a framework for formulating an accelerated sampling algorithm specifically for the task of training database generation. The key idea is to start from a physically motivated sampler (e.g., molecular dynamics) and add a biasing term that drives the system towards high uncertainty and thus to unseen training configurations. Building on this framework, general protocols for building training databases for alloys and polymers leveraging the HAL framework will be presented. For alloys, ACE potentials for AlSi10 are created by fitting to a minimal HAL-generated database containing 88 configurations (32 atoms each) with fast evaluation times of \&lt;100 microsecond/atom/cpu-core. These potentials are demonstrated to predict the melting temperature with excellent accuracy. For polymers, a HAL database is built using ACE, able to determine the density of a long polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer formed of 200 monomer units with experimental accuracy by only fitting to small isolated PEG polymers with sizes ranging from 2 to 32.},

  abstract = {Sequences have become first class citizens in supervised learning thanks to the resurgence of recurrent neural networks. Many complex tasks that require mapping from or to a sequence of observations can now be formulated with the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) framework which employs the chain rule to efficiently represent the joint probability of sequences. In many cases, however, variable sized inputs and/or outputs might not be naturally expressed as sequences. For instance, it is not clear how to input a set of numbers into a model where the task is to sort them; similarly, we do not know how to organize outputs when they correspond to random variables and the task is to model their unknown joint probability. In this paper, we first show using various examples that the order in which we organize input and/or output data matters significantly when learning an underlying model. We then discuss an extension of the seq2seq framework that goes beyond sequences and handles input sets in a principled way. In addition, we propose a loss which, by searching over possible orders during training, deals with the lack of structure of output sets. We show empirical evidence of our claims regarding ordering, and on the modifications to the seq2seq framework on benchmark language modeling and parsing tasks, as well as two artificial tasks -- sorting numbers and estimating the joint probability of unknown graphical models.},

While first principles simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) provide insight into the Li               +               transport mechanism, historically, there has been a gap in the temperature ranges studied in simulations and experiments. Here, we used a neural network potential trained on density functional theory (DFT) simulations, to run up to 40-nanosecond long MD simulations at DFT-like accuracy to characterize the ion conduction mechanisms across a range of temperatures that includes previous simulations and experimental studies. We have confirmed a Li               +               sublattice phase transition in LGPS around 400 K, below which the               ab               -plane diffusivity                                                                                                                             D                                            a                       b                                          {${_\ast}$}                                                                                   is drastically reduced. Concomitant with the sublattice phase transition near 400 K, there is less cation-cation (cross) correlation, as characterized by Haven ratios closer to 1, and the vibrations in the system are more harmonic at lower temperature. Intuitively, at high temperature, the collection of vibrational modes may be sufficient to drive concerted ion hops. However, near room temperature, the vibrational modes available may be insufficient to overcome electrostatic repulsion, thus resulting in less correlated ion motion and comparatively slower ion conduction. Such phenomena of a sublattice phase transition, below which concerted hopping plays a less significant role, may be extended to other highly concentrated solid electrolytes such as LLZO and LATP.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are designed for high elevated-temperature strength, with both edge and screw dislocations playing an important role for plastic deformation. However, they can also display a significant energetic driving force for chemical short-range ordering (SRO). Here, we investigate mechanisms underlying the mobilities of screw and edge dislocations in the body-centered cubic MoNbTaW RHEA over a wide temperature range using extensive molecular dynamics simulations based on a highly-accurate machine-learning interatomic potential. Further, we specifically evaluate how these mechanisms are affected by the presence of SRO. The mobility of edge dislocations is found to be enhanced by the presence of SRO, whereas the rate of double-kink nucleation in the motion of screw dislocations is reduced, although this influence of SRO appears to be attenuated at increasing temperature. Independent of the presence of SRO, a cross-slip locking mechanism is observed for the motion of screws, which provides for extra strengthening for refractory high-entropy alloy system.},
