  "abstract": "In this paper we apply fluid-lattice gas global isomorphism approach to liquid-vapor equilibrium of Yukawa attractive fluid in the two dimensions. The construction of tangent to the binodal of the fluid in the low-temperature region is performed based on the Zeno-element. The dependence of Zeno-element and Boyle parameters on interaction parameters is also studied. It is shown that the asymptotic behavior of the Zeno-element parameters can serve as a marker for liquid phase instability in this case. We also provide the relation between critical temperatures of bulk (3D) and monolayer (2D) fluid.",
