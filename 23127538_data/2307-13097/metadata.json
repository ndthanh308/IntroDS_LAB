  "abstract": "We investigate geometric properties of a class of trace functions expressed in terms of the deformed logarithmic and exponential functions. These trace functions and their properties may be of independent interest. We use them in particular to extend earlier results of Epstein, Hiai, Carlen and Lieb.",
