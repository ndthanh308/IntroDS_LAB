  "abstract": "The method is based on the preliminary transformation of the traditionally used matrices or adjacency lists in the graph theory into refined projections free from redundant information, and their subsequent use in constructing shortest paths. Unlike adjacency matrices and lists based on enumerating binary adjacency relations, the refined projection is based on enumerating more complex relations: simple paths from a given graph vertex that are shortest. The preliminary acquisition of such projections reduces the algorithmic complexity of applications using them and improves their volumetric and real-time characteristics to linear ones for a pair of vertices. The class of graphs considered is extended to mixed graphs.",
