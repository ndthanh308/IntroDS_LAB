  "abstract": "We prove an asymptotic formula for the eighth moment of Dirichlet $L$-functions averaged over primitive characters $χ$ modulo $q$, over all moduli $q\\leq Q$ and with a short average on the critical line. Previously the same result was shown conditionally on the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis by the first two authors.",
