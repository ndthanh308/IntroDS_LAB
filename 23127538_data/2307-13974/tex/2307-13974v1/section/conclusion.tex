\section{Conclusion}


In this report, we propose Tracking Anything in High Quality (HQTrack).
HQTrack mainly consists of a video multi-object segmenter (VMOS) and a mask refiner (MR).
VMOS is responsible for propagating multiple targets in video frames, and MR is a large-scale pre-trained segmentation model in charge of refining the segmentation masks.
HQTrack demonstrates powerful object tracking and segmentation capabilities.
Finally, HQTrack achieves the 2nd place in the Visual Object Tracking and Segmentation (VOTS2023) challenge.
