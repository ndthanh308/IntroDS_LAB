  "abstract": "The aim of the work is to construct new polynomial systems, which are solutions to certain functional equations which generalize the second-order differential equations satisfied by the so called classical orthogonal polynomial families of Jacobi, Laguerre, Hermite and Bessel. These functional equations can be chosen to be of different type: fractional differential equations, q-difference equations, etc, which converge to their respective differential equations of the aforesaid classical orthogonal polynomials. In addition to this, there exists a confluence of both the families of polynomials constructed and the functional equations who approach to the classical families of polynomials and second-order differential equations, respectively",
