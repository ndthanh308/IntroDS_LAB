  "abstract": "A \\emph{Hessenberg Schubert variety} is an irreducible component of the intersection of a Schubert variety and a Hessenberg variety, defined as the closure of a Schubert cell inside the Hessenberg variety. We consider the smoothness of Hessenberg Schubert varieties of regular semisimple Hessenberg varieties of type $A$ in this paper.\n  We consider the smoothness of the intersection of a Schubert variety and a Hessenberg variety to ensure the smoothness of the corresponding Hessenberg Schubert variety. Specifically, we analyze the structure of the GKM graphs of the intersection of a Schubert variety indexed by some special permutations and a Hessenberg variety. The regularity of the GKM graph is completely characterized in terms of pattern avoidance, which is a necessary (and also sufficient conjecturally) condition for the intersection to be smooth. We then extend the pattern avoidance result to all permutations, which is believed to be a sufficient condition for the corresponding Hessenberg Schubert variety to be smooth.",

  "comment": "We realized that a $T$-stable curve in $\\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ between $u$ and $v$ in $Ω_{w,h}^T$ may not be contained in $Ω_{w,h}$; it is only contained in the intersection of $\\mathrm{Hess}(S,h)$ with $Ω_{w}$. So we fixed the parts that rely on this in each section. We have also revised some notations and terms",
