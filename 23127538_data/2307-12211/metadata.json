  "abstract": "Transition metal clusters have a broad spectrum of potential applications in electronic and magnetic devices owing to their unique properties. Protective shells such as fullerene C$_{80}$ can be introduced to improve their stability. In this study, we optimized five core shell structures, C$_{80}$+M$_{13}$ (V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Co), and calculated their electromagnetic properties using density functional theory.We determined that there is electron transfer between C$_{80}$ and the transition metal clusters near the Fermi surface, and that the d orbitals contribute most to the magnetism of the structure. C$_{80}$+Ni$_{13}$ was antiferromagnetic. The magnetic properties of the clusters were significantly altered, revealing antiferromagnetism. The results establish a theoretical starting point for tuning the electronic and magnetic properties of 13-atom clusters embedded in fullerene cages.",
