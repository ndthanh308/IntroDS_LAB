  "abstract": "Resonance ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is a non-destructive technique used to assess materials' elastic and anelastic properties. It involves measuring the frequencies of free vibrations in a carefully prepared sample to extract material properties. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of eigenfrequencies. Our primary focus is on analyzing the asymptotic behavior of eigenfrequencies, aiming to understand their rate of growth and convergence. We also make observations regarding the impact of elastic constants on eigenfrequencies.",
