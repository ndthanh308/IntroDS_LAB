	url = {},
	abstract = {A 3D flexible bin packing problem (3D-FBPP) arises from the process of warehouse packing in e-commerce. An online customer's order usually contains several items and needs to be packed as a whole before shipping. In particular, 5\% of tens of millions of packages are using plastic wrapping as outer packaging every day, which brings pressure on the plastic surface minimization to save traditional logistics costs. Because of the huge practical significance, we focus on the issue of packing cuboid-shaped items orthogonally into a least-surface-area bin. The existing heuristic methods for classic 3D bin packing don't work well for this particular NP-hard problem and designing a good problem-specific heuristic is non-trivial. In this paper, rather than designing heuristics, we propose a novel multi-task framework based on Selected Learning to learn a heuristic-like policy that generates the sequence and orientations of items to be packed simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments on a large scale real-world transaction order dataset and online AB tests, we show: 1) our selected learning method trades off the imbalance and correlation among the tasks and significantly outperforms the single task Pointer Network and the multi-task network without selected learning; 2) our method obtains an average 5.47\% cost reduction than the well-designed greedy algorithm which is previously used in our online production system.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new type of 3D bin packing problem (BPP) is proposed, in which a number of cuboid-shaped items must be put into a bin one by one orthogonally. The objective is to find a way to place these items that can minimize the surface area of the bin. This problem is based on the fact that there is no fixed-sized bin in many real business scenarios and the cost of a bin is proportional to its surface area. Our research shows that this problem is NP-hard. Based on previous research on 3D BPP, the surface area is determined by the sequence, spatial locations and orientations of items. Among these factors, the sequence of items plays a key role in minimizing the surface area. Inspired by recent achievements of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques, especially Pointer Network, on combinatorial optimization problems such as TSP, a DRL-based method is applied to optimize the sequence of items to be packed into the bin. Numerical results show that the method proposed in this paper achieve about 5\% improvement than heuristic method.},

	abstract = {Loading the containers on the ship from a yard, is an impor- tant part of port operations. Finding the optimal sequence for the loading of containers, is known to be computationally hard and is an example of combinatorial optimization, which leads to the application of simple heuristics in practice. In this paper, we propose an approach which uses a mix of Evolutionary Strategies and Reinforcement Learning (RL) tech- niques to find an approximation of the optimal solution. The RL based agent uses the Policy Gradient method, an evolutionary reward strategy and a Pool of good (not-optimal) solutions to find the approximation. We find that the RL agent learns near-optimal solutions that outperforms the heuristic solutions. We also observe that the RL agent assisted with a pool generalizes better for unseen problems than an RL agent without a pool. We present our results on synthetic data as well as on subsets of real-world problems taken from container terminal. The results validate that our approach does comparatively better than the heuristics solutions available, and adapts to unseen problems better.},

In this approach, we train a single model that finds near-optimal solutions for problem instances sampled from a given distribution, only by observing the reward signals and following feasibility rules. Our model represents a parameterized stochastic policy, and by applying a policy gradient algorithm to optimize its parameters, the trained model produces the solution as a sequence of consecutive actions in real time, without the need to re-train for every new problem instance. On capacitated VRP, our approach outperforms classical heuristics and Google's OR-Tools on medium-sized instances in solution quality with comparable computation time (after training). We demonstrate how our approach can handle problems with split delivery and explore the effect of such deliveries on the solution quality. Our proposed framework can be applied to other variants of the VRP such as the stochastic VRP, and has the potential to be applied more generally to combinatorial optimization problems.},

	abstract = {In standard reinforcement learning (RL), a learning agent seeks to optimize the overall reward. However, many key aspects of a desired behavior are more naturally expressed as constraints. For instance, the designer may want to limit the use of unsafe actions, increase the diversity of trajectories to enable exploration, or approximate expert trajectories when rewards are sparse. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic scheme that can handle a wide class of constraints in RL tasks: specifically, any constraints that require expected values of some vector measurements (such as the use of an action) to lie in a convex set. This captures previously studied constraints (such as safety and proximity to an expert), but also enables new classes of constraints (such as diversity). Our approach comes with rigorous theoretical guarantees and only relies on the ability to approximately solve standard RL tasks. As a result, it can be easily adapted to work with any model-free or model-based RL. In our experiments, we show that it matches previous algorithms that enforce safety via constraints, but can also enforce new properties that these algorithms do not incorporate, such as diversity.},

	abstract = {For many applications of reinforcement learning it can be more convenient to specify both a reward function and constraints, rather than trying to design behavior through the reward function. For example, systems that physically interact with or around humans should satisfy safety constraints. Recent advances in policy search algorithms (Mnih et al., 2016, Schulman et al., 2015, Lillicrap et al., 2016, Levine et al., 2016) have enabled new capabilities in high-dimensional control, but do not consider the constrained setting. We propose Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO), the first general-purpose policy search algorithm for constrained reinforcement learning with guarantees for near-constraint satisfaction at each iteration. Our method allows us to train neural network policies for high-dimensional control while making guarantees about policy behavior all throughout training. Our guarantees are based on a new theoretical result, which is of independent interest: we prove a bound relating the expected returns of two policies to an average divergence between them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated robot locomotion tasks where the agent must satisfy constraints motivated by safety.},

The deep neural network is used to characterize the input instance for constructing a feasible solution incrementally. Recently, an attention model is proposed to solve routing problems. In this model, the state of an instance is represented by node features that are fixed over time. However, the fact is, the state of an instance is changed according to the decision that the model made at different construction steps, and the node features should be updated correspondingly. Therefore, this paper presents a dynamic attention model with dynamic encoder-decoder architecture, which enables the model to explore node features dynamically and exploit hidden structure information effectively at different construction steps. This paper focuses on a challenging NP-hard problem, vehicle routing problem. The experiments indicate that our model outperforms the previous methods and also shows a good generalization performance.},

	abstract = {The continued growth of the volume of global containerized transport necessitates that most of the major ports in the world improve port productivity by investing in more interconnected terminals. The development of the multiterminal system escalates the complexity of the container transport process and increases the demand for container exchange between different terminals within a port, known as interterminal transport (ITT). Trucks are still the primary modes of freight transportation to transport containers among most terminals. A trucking company needs to consider proper truck routing planning because, based on several studies, it played an essential role in coordinating ITT flows. Furthermore, optimal truck routing in the context of ITT significantly affects port productivity and efficiency. The study of deep reinforcement learning in truck routing optimization is still limited. In this study, we propose deep reinforcement learning to provide truck routes of a given container transport order by considering several significant factors such as order origin, destination, time window, and due date. To assess its performance, we compared between the proposed method and two approaches that are used to solve truck routing problems. The experiment results showed that the proposed method obtains considerably better results compared to the other algorithms.},

Our solution employs a novel data-driven three-layer search algorithm (DTSA), which we designed to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional meta-heuristic approaches, through learning from data and from simulation. A detailed experimental evaluation on real data shows our algorithm is versatile in solving this practical complex constrained multi-objective optimization problem, and our framework may be of general interest. DTSA performs much better than the state-of-the-art algorithms both in efficiency and optimization performance. Our algorithm has been deployed in the UAT (User Acceptance Test) environment; conservative estimates suggest that the full usage of our algorithm would save millions of dollars in logistics costs per year, besides savings due to automation and more efficient routing.},

	abstract = {Efficient container loading has the potential to considerably reduce logistics and transportation costs. The container loading problem is computationally complex and, despite extensive academic effort, there remains room for algorithm improvement. Real-world problems are not always addressed satisfactorily primarily due to the large number of complex constraints and objectives. The problem addressed by this work is an unsolved multiple container loading problem introduced by Renault on the occasion of the 2014/2015 ESICUP challenge, organized by the EURO Special Interest Group on Cutting and Packing (ESICUP). Renault’s problem requires a large number of different items to be packed into containers of different types and sizes. Items must be grouped into stacks and respect the ‘this side up’ constraint. The primary objective is to minimize the volume of shipped containers. The smallest volume container may be left behind for the next shipment and is excluded from the main objective. Nevertheless, only a limited percentage of each product may be packed into this container. Additionally, a set of secondary objectives is considered. This work presents a decomposition approach embedded in a multi-phase heuristic for the problem. Feasible solutions are generated quickly, and subsequently improved by local search and post-processing procedures. Experiments revealed that the approach generates optimal solutions for two instances, in addition to good quality solutions for those remaining from the Renault set. The algorithmic contribution is, however, not restricted to the Renault instances. Experiments on less constrained container loading instances from the literature demonstrate the approach’s general applicability and competitiveness.},

But there are two ways to implement FIFO in this context: at the hearing level or at the case level. Our model indicates that the former policy, prioritizing the oldest hearing, is optimal when the case completion hazard rate function decreases, and the latter policy, prioritizing the oldest case, is optimal when the case completion hazard rate function increases. This result convinced six judges of the Roman Labor Court of Appeals—a court that exhibits increasing hazard rates—to switch from hearing-level FIFO to case-level FIFO. Tracking these judges for eight years, we estimate that our intervention decreased the average case duration by 12\% and the probability of a decision being appealed to the Italian supreme court by 3.8\%, relative to a 44-judge control sample.},

	abstract = {Big data have enabled decision makers to tailor decisions at the individual level in a variety of domains, such as personalized medicine and online advertising. Doing so involves learning a model of decision rewards conditional on individual-specific covariates. In many practical settings, these covariates are high dimensional; however, typically only a small subset of the observed features are predictive of a decision’s success. We formulate this problem as a K-armed contextual bandit with high-dimensional covariates and present a new efficient bandit algorithm based on the LASSO estimator. We prove that our algorithm’s cumulative expected regret scales at most polylogarithmically in the covariate dimension d; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first such bound for a contextual bandit. The key step in our analysis is proving a new tail inequality that guarantees the convergence of the LASSO estimator despite the non-i.i.d. data induced by the bandit policy. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical relevance of our algorithm by evaluating it on a simplified version of a medication dosing problem. A patient’s optimal medication dosage depends on the patient’s genetic profile and medical records; incorrect initial dosage may result in adverse consequences, such as stroke or bleeding. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing bandit methods and physicians in correctly dosing a majority of patients.},

We observe that packing workers at the warehouses of Alibaba Group deviate from algorithmic prescriptions for 5.8\% of packages, and these deviations increase packing time and reduce operational efficiency. We posit two mechanisms and demonstrate that they result in two types of deviations: (1) information deviations stem from workers having more information and in turn better solutions than the algorithm; and (2) complexity deviations result from workers' aversion, inability or discretion to precisely implement algorithmic prescriptions.We propose a new "human-centric bin packing algorithm" that anticipates and incorporates human deviations to reduce deviations and improve performance. It predicts when workers are more likely to switch to larger boxes using machine learning techniques and then pro-actively adjusts the algorithmic prescriptions of those ``targeted packages.'' We conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment with the Alibaba Group. Orders were randomly assigned to either the new algorithm (treatment group) or Alibaba's original algorithm (control group). Our field experiment results show that our new algorithm lowers the rate of switching to larger boxes from 29.5\% to 23.8\% for targeted packages and reduces the average packing time of targeted packages by 4.5\%. This idea of incorporating human deviations to improve optimization algorithms could also be generalized to other processes in logistics and operations.},

Our model represents a parameterized stochastic policy, and by applying a policy gradient algorithm to optimize its parameters, the trained model produces the solution as a sequence of consecutive actions in real time, without the need to re-train for every new problem instance. On capacitated VRP, our approach outperforms classical heuristics and Google's OR-Tools on medium-sized instances in solution quality with comparable computation time (after training). We demonstrate how our approach can handle problems with split delivery and explore the effect of such deliveries on the solution quality.

The deep neural network is used to characterize the input instance for constructing a feasible solution incrementally. Recently, an attention model is proposed to solve routing problems. In this model, the state of an instance is represented by node features that are fixed over time. However, the fact is, the state of an instance is changed according to the decision that the model made at different construction steps, and the node features should be updated correspondingly. Therefore, this paper presents a dynamic attention model with dynamic encoder-decoder architecture, which enables the model to explore node features dynamically and exploit hidden structure information effectively at different construction steps. This paper focuses on a challenging NP-hard problem, vehicle routing problem. The experiments indicate that our model outperforms the previous methods and also shows a good generalization performance.},

Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a ‘good’ explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

	abstract = {We introduce and solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pick-ups and Deliveries and Two-Dimensional Loading Constraints (2L-SPD). The 2L-SPD model covers cases where customers raise delivery and pick-up requests for transporting non-stackable rectangular items. 2L-SPD belongs to the class of composite routing-packing optimization problems. However, it is the first such problem to consider bi-directional material flows dictated in practice by reverse logistics policies. The aspect of simultaneously satisfying deliveries and pick-ups has a major impact on the underlying loading constraints: feasible loading patterns must be identified for every arc traveled in the routing plan. This implies that 2L-SPD generalizes previous routing problem variants with two-dimensional loading constraints which call for one feasible loading per route. From a managerial perspective, the simultaneous service of deliveries and pick-ups may bring substantial cost-savings, but the generalized loading constraints are very hard to tackle in reasonable computational times. To this end, we propose an optimization framework which employs memorization techniques designed for the 2L-SPD model, to accelerate the solution methodology. To assess the performance of our routing and packing algorithmic components, we have solved the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pick-ups and Deliveries (VRPSPD) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Two-Dimensional Constraints (2L-CVRP). Computational results are also reported on newly constructed 2L-SPD benchmark problems. Apart from the basic 2L-SPD version, we introduce the 2L-SPD with LIFO constraints which prohibit item rearrangements along the routes. Computational experiments are conducted to understand the impact of the LIFO constraints on the routing plans obtained.},

In the 3L-PDP, each request is given as a set of 3D rectangular items (boxes) and the vehicle capacity is replaced by a 3D loading space. We investigate which constraints will ensure that no reloading effort will occur, i.e. that no box is moved after loading and before unloading. A spectrum of 3L-PDP variants is introduced with different characteristics in terms of reloading effort. We propose a hybrid algorithm for solving the 3L-PDP consisting of a routing and a packing procedure. The routing procedure modifies a well-known large neighborhood search for the 1D-PDP.

First, we overview the recent developments in the literature on all vehicle types in which loading constraints play a key role (trucks, airplanes, ships, and automated guided vehicles), using a state-of-the-art classification scheme to identify the loading constraints considered in each article. Second, we identify research gaps and opportunities for future research.},

Apparently, 3L-CVRP is a combination of capacitated vehicle routing and three-dimensional bin packing problem and thus of high complexity. Different from most of previous works, we propose an innovative approach, called improved least waste heuristic for solving the loading subproblem, which is iteratively invoked by a simple tabu search algorithm for the routing. The good performance in terms of the solution quality and computational efficiency of our approach is shown through the numerical experiments on the benchmark instances from literature.},

	abstract = {This study introduces a new practical variant of the combined routing and loading problem called the capacitated vehicle routing problem minimizing fuel consumption under three-dimensional loading constraints (3L-FCVRP). It presents a meta-heuristic algorithm for solving the problem. The aim is to design routes for a fleet of homogeneous vehicles that will serve all customers, whose demands are formed by a set of three-dimensional, rectangular, weighted items. Unlike the well-studied capacitated vehicle routing problem with 3D loading constraints (3L-CVRP), the objective of the 3L-FCVRP is to minimize total fuel consumption rather than travel distance. The fuel consumption rate is assumed to be proportionate to the total weight of the vehicle. A route is feasible only if a feasible loading plan to load the demanded items into the vehicle exists and the loading plan must satisfy a set of practical constraints. To solve this problem, the evolutionary local search (ELS) framework incorporating the recombination method is used to explore the solution space, and a new heuristic based on open space is used to examine the feasibility of the solutions. In addition, two special data structures, Trie and Fibonacci heap, are adopted to speed up the procedure. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we first test the ELS on the 3L-CVRP, which can be seen as a special case of the 3L-FCVRP. The results demonstrate that on average ELS outperforms all of the existing approaches and improves the best-known solutions for most instances. Then, we generate data for 3L-FCVRP and report the detailed results of the ELS for future comparisons.},

This problem is known as 3L-CVRP (Three-dimensional Loading Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem). The proposed methodology consists of two phases. The first phase uses an optimization procedure based on cuts to obtain solutions for the well-known Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The second phase validates the results of the first phase of a GRASP algorithm (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure). In particular, the GRASP approach evaluates the packing constraints for each performed route of the CVRP. The proposed hybrid algorithm uses a relaxation of the classical model of two sub-indices for the vehicle routing problem. Specifically different types of cuts are added: subtour elimination, capacity-cut constraints, and packing-cut constrains. The proposed algorithm is compared with the most efficient approaches for the 3L-CVRP on the set of benchmark instances considered in the literature. The computational results indicate that the proposed approach is able to obtain good solutions, improving some of the best-known solutions from the literature.},

Our model indicates that the former policy, prioritizing the oldest hearing, is optimal when the case completion hazard rate function decreases, and the latter policy, prioritizing the oldest case, is optimal when the case completion hazard rate function increases. This result convinced six judges of the Roman Labor Court of Appeals—a  that exhibits increasing hazard rates—to switch from hearing-level FIFO to case-level FIFO. Tracking these judges for eight years, we estimate that our intervention decreased the  case  by 12\% and the probability of  being appealed to the Italian  by 3.8\%, relative to a 44-judge  sample.},

In the VRPCB each customer is either a linehaul or a backhaul customer and in each route all linehaul customers must be visited before any backhaul customer. In the 3L-VRPCB, each customer demand is given as a set of 3D rectangular items (boxes) and the vehicle capacity is replaced by a 3D loading space. Moreover, some packing constraints, e.g. concerning stacking of boxes, are also integrated. A set of routes of minimum total length has to be determined such that each customer is visited once. For each route two packing plans have to be provided that stow all boxes of all visited linehaul and backhaul customers, respectively, taking into account the additional packing constraints. We propose two hybrid algorithms for solving the 3L-VRPCB, each of them consisting of a routing and a packing procedure. The routing procedures follow different metaheuristic strategies (large vs. variable neighborhood search) and in both algorithms a tree search heuristic is responsible for packing boxes. Extensive computational experiments were carried out using 95 3L-VRPCB benchmark instances that were derived from well-known VRPCB instances. Good results are also achieved for the capacitated vehicle routing problem with 3D loading constraints as a special case of the 3L-VRPCB.},

The departure time from depot becomes an important decision to reduce the route duration. We provide an alternative arc-based mixed-integer programming model with explicit arc time zone index. For larger scale instances, we extend the segment-based evaluation method to speed up the feasibility check of a given vehicle route. It is thereafter incorporated to implement an efficient hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search with tabu search (ALNS-TS) algorithm, to explore both feasible and infeasible solution spaces. The ALNS-TS exploits the strength of diversification in ALNS through adaptive control of neighborhood size, as well as the strength of intensification in TS by limiting the maximum number of steps allowed without improvement. Related parameters are tuned using an automatic configuration tool to determine the best set of configurations. The computational results demonstrate its excellent performance on the benchmark instances proposed by Dabia et al. (2013), obtaining optimal solutions for all instances with 25 customers and improving best-known solutions for 36 instances with 50 and 100 customers. Computational experiments are also conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm on an extra set of large scale instances and on the simplified VRPTW instances.},

In the 3L-SDVRP splitting deliveries of customers is basically possible, i.e. a customer can be visited in two or more tours. We examine essential problem features and introduce two problem variants. In the first variant, called 3L-SDVRP with forced splitting, a delivery is only split if the demand of a customer cannot be transported by a single vehicle. In the second variant, termed 3L-SDVRP with optional splitting, splitting customer deliveries can be done any number of times. We propose a hybrid algorithm consisting of a local search algorithm for routing and a genetic algorithm and several construction heuristics for packing. Numerical experiments are conducted using three sets of instances with both industrial and academic origins. One of them was provided by an automotive logistics company in Shanghai; in this case some customers per instance have a total freight volume larger than the loading space of a vehicle. The results prove that splitting deliveries can be beneficial not only in the one-dimensional case but also when goods are modeled as three-dimensional items.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel vehicle routing problem with time window and pallet loading constraints; this problem accounts for the actual needs of businesses in the logistics industry such as the delivery of consumer goods and agricultural products. To solve this new VRP, we propose a hybrid approach by combining Tabu search and the artificial bee colony algorithm. A new benchmark data set is generated to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm because the proposed VRP has never been reported in the literature. Experiments are performed for a data set of Solomon's 56 vehicle routing problem with time windows.

Although there are reported works on solving approaches for the relaxed 3L-CVRP that consider product rotation to optimize load capacity, rotation on the three axes has not been thoroughly studied. In this aspect, the present work explicitly explores the three-axes rotation and its impact on load capacity optimization. In order to improve the relaxed 3L-CVRP problem, a two-phase solution was developed. The first phase consists of finding the solution for the CVRP problem, using a demand previously obtained with a heuristic developed to convert the 3L-CVRP demand into CVRP demand. The second phase is to obtain the loading of the vehicle using a heuristic developed to load the items using rules to obtain the rotation of the items. The proposed approach was able to improve the load assignment in 48.1\% of well-known 3L-CVRP instances when compared to similar approaches on the relaxed 3L-CVRP. The outcomes of this research can be applied to transportation problems where package rotation on the z-axis is an option, and there are not fragile items to load in the vehicles.},

	abstract = {We develop a data-driven decision model to improve process quality in manufacturing. A challenge for traditional methods in quality management is to handle high-dimensional and nonlinear manufacturing data. We address this challenge by adapting explainable artiﬁcial intelligence to the context of quality management. Speciﬁcally, we propose the use of nonlinear modeling with SHAP values to infer how a set of production parameters and the process quality of a manufacturing system are related. Thereby, we contribute a measure of process importance based on which manufacturers can prioritize processes for quality improvement. Grounded in quality management theory, our decision model selects improvement actions that target the sources of quality variation. The decision model is validated in a real-world application at a leading manufacturer of high-power semiconductors. Seeking to improve production yield, we apply our decision model to select improvement actions for a transistor chip product. We then conduct a ﬁeld experiment to conﬁrm the eﬀectiveness of the improvement actions. Compared to the average yield in our sample, the experiment returns a reduction in yield loss by 21.7\%. Furthermore, we report on results from a post-experimental roll-out of the decision model, which also resulted in signiﬁcant yield improvements. We demonstrate the operational value of explainable artiﬁcial intelligence by showing that critical drivers of process quality can go undiscovered by the use of traditional methods.},

	abstract = {Freight transport is of major importance for the European economy and is growing thanks to increasing global trade. About three quarters of inland freight transport in the European Union is on roads. It has the potential to go through a dramatic change over the next decades thanks to the recent development of technologies such as wireless communication, cloud computing, sensor devices, and vehicle electronics. They enable a new integrated goods transport system based on optimized logistics, real-time traffic information, vehicular communications, collaborative driving, and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we discuss challenges in creating a more efficient and sustainable goods road transportation system and how some of them can be tackled with a networked control approach. In particular, we discuss a method to improve the efficiency of the transportation system by minimizing the number of empty transports needed to fulfill the assignments on a given road network. Assignments with overlapping route segments might lead to further improvements, as the formation of vehicle platoons yields reduced fuel consumption. For realistic scenarios, it is shown that such collaboration opportunities arise already with relatively few vehicles. The fuel-efficient formation and control of platoons is also discussed. Some of the presented methods have been tested on real vehicles in traffic. The paper shows experimental results on automatic formation of vehicle platoons on a Swedish highway. The influence of traffic density on the merge maneuver is illustrated. The results indicate that platoon coordination could be improved by support from appropriate traffic monitoring technologies.},

	abstract = {In horizontal collaborations, carriers form coalitions in order to perform parts of their logistics operations jointly. By exchanging transportation requests among each other, they can operate more efficiently and in a more sustainable way. Collaborative vehicle routing has been extensively discussed in the literature. We identify three major streams of research: (i) centralized collaborative planning, (ii) decentralized planning without auctions, and (ii) auction-based decentralized planning. For each of them we give a structured overview on the state of knowledge and discuss future research directions.},
