  abstract = {In this article, we describe some recent results on the hybridization methods for the analysis of nonlinear systems. The main idea of our hybridization approach is to apply the hybrid systems methodology as a systematic approximation method. More concretely, we partition the state space of a complex system into regions that only intersect on their boundaries, and then approximate its dynamics in each region by a simpler one. Then, the resulting hybrid system, which we call a hybridization, is used to yield approximate analysis results for the original system. We also prove important properties of the hybridization, and propose two effective hybridization construction methods, which allow approximating the original nonlinear system with a good convergence rate.}

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with reachable set computation for non-linear systems using hybridization. The essence of hybridization is to approximate a non-linear vector field by a simpler (such as affine) vector field. This is done by partitioning the state space into small regions within each of which a simpler vector field is defined. This approach relies on the availability of methods for function approximation and for handling the resulting dynamical systems. Concerning function approximation using interpolation, the accuracy depends on the shapes and sizes of the regions which can compromise as well the speed of reachability computation since it may generate spurious classes of trajectories. In this paper we study the relationship between the region geometry and reachable set accuracy and propose a method for constructing hybridization regions using tighter interpolation error bounds. In addition, our construction exploits the dynamics of the system to adapt the orientation of the regions, in order to achieve better time-efficiency. We also present some experimental results on a high-dimensional biological system, to demonstrate the performance improvement.},

By using stability analysis we show that one of these equilibrium points is a saddle point from which there are two separatrices which divide the phase plane into two regions. In one region all phase paths approach a limit cycle and in the other all phase paths approach a stable equilibrium point. A consequence of this is that a short depolarizing current pulse will change an initially silent model neuron into one that fires repetitively. Addition of a third equation limits this firing to either an isolated burst or a depolarizing afterpotential. When steady depolarizing current was applied to this model it resulted in periodic bursting. The equations, which were initially developed to explain isolated triggered bursts, therefore provide one of the simplest models of the more general phenomenon of oscillatory burst discharge.},

Affine dynamics are handled by on-the-fly overapproximation and partitioning of the state space based on user-provided constraints and the dynamics of the system. PHAVer features exact arithmetic in a robust implementation that, based on the Parma Polyhedra Library, supports arbitrarily large numbers. To force termination and manage the complexity of the polyhedral computations, we propose methods to conservatively limit the number of bits and constraints of polyhedra.

A flowpipe sampling attributes to each time point a polyhedral enclosure of the set of states reachable at that time point, and is capable of representing a nonconvex enclosure of a nonconvex flowpipe. The use of flowpipe samplings allows us to represent and approximate the nonconvex flowpipe efficiently. In particular, we can measure the error incurred by the initial approximation and by further processing such as simplification and convexification. A flowpipe sampling can be efficiently translated into a set of convex polyhedra in a way that minimizes the number of convex sets for a given error bound. When applying flowpipe approximation for the reachability of hybrid systems, a reduction in the number of convex sets spawned by each image computation can lead to drastic performance improvements.},

When interacting with the physical world, modeled by continuous or hybrid systems, exact relationships are restrictive and not robust. In this paper, we develop the first framework of system approximation that applies to both discrete and continuous systems by developing notions of approximate language inclusion, approximate simulation, and approximate bisimulation relations. We define a hierarchy of approximation pseudo-metrics between two systems that quantify the quality of the approximation, and capture the established exact relationships as zero sections. Our approximation framework is compositional for a synchronous composition operator. Algorithms are developed for computing the proposed pseudo-metrics, both exactly and approximately. The exact algorithms require the generalization of the fixed point algorithms for computing simulation and bisimulation relations, or dually, the solution of a static game whose cost is the so-called branching distance between the systems. Approximations for the pseudo-metrics can be obtained by considering Lyapunov-like functions called simulation and bisimulation functions. We illustrate our approximation framework in reducing the complexity of safety verification problems for both deterministic and nondeterministic continuous systems.},

Many verification tasks for such programs can be expressed as reachability problems for hybrid automata. By improving on previous decidability and undecidability results, we identify a boundary between decidability and undecidability for the reachability problem of hybrid automata. On the positive side, we give an (optimal) PSPACE reachability algorithm for the case of initialized rectangular automata, where all analog variables follow independent trajectories within piecewise-linear envelopes and are reinitialized whenever the envelope changes. Our algorithm is based on the construction of a timed automaton that contains all reachability information about a given initialized rectangular automaton. The translation has practical significance for verification, because it guarantees the termination of symbolic procedures for the reachability analysis of initialized rectangular automata. The translation also preserves the{$\omega$}-languages of initialized rectangular automata with bounded nondeterminism. On the negative side, we show that several slight generalizations of initialized rectangular automata lead to an undecidable reachability problem. In particular, we prove that the reachability problem is undecidable for timed automata augmented with a single stopwatch.},

The analysis of systems described by nonlinear differential equations is known to be particularly challenging.

This reduces the analysis of a system with nonlinear dynamics to the one with piecewise affine dynamics, which have powerful analysis methods. In this paper, we present improvements to the hybridization approach based on a dynamics scaling model transformation. The transformation aims to reduce the sizes of the linearization domains, and therefore reduces overapproximation error.

The UReLU neural network is a single hidden layer neural network, and the structure is relatively simple. The initialization of the neural network employs the decoupling method, which provides a good initialization and some insight into the nonlinear system.

In this article, we aim to construct the deep AHH (DAHH) model to extend and generalize the networking of AHH model for high-dimensional problems. The network structure of DAHH is determined through a forward growth, in which the activity ratio is introduced to select effective neurons and no connecting weights are involved between the layers. Then, all neurons in the DAHH network can be flexibly connected to the output in a skip-layer format, and only the corresponding weights are the parameters to optimize. With such a network framework, the backpropagation algorithm can be implemented in DAHH to efficiently tackle large-scale problems and the gradient vanishing problem is not encountered in the training of DAHH. In fact, the optimization problem of DAHH can maintain convexity with convex loss in the output layer, which brings natural advantages in optimization. Different from the existing neural networks, DAHH is easier to interpret, where neurons are connected sparsely and analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition can be applied, facilitating to revealing the interactions between variables. A theoretical analysis toward universal approximation ability and explicit domain partitions are also derived. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed DAHH.},

It is proved that for every EHH neural network, there is an equivalent adaptive hinging hyperplanes (AHH) tree, the model of which was proposed based on the hinging hyperplanes (HH) model and finds good applications in system identification. Analog to the proof for the AHH model, the universal approximation ability of the EHH neural network is provided.

Such approaches have been successfully developed and implemented for the synthesis of controllers over non-probabilistic control systems. In this paper, we extend the technique to probabilistic control systems modelled by controlled stochastic differential equations. We show that for every stochastic control system satisfying a probabilistic variant of incremental input-to-state stability, and for every given precision {$\epsilon$} {$>$} 0, a finite-state transition system can be constructed, which is {$\epsilon$}-approximately bisimilar to the original stochastic control system. Moreover, we provide results relating stochastic control systems to their corresponding finite-state transition systems in terms of probabilistic bisimulation relations known in the literature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the construction by synthesizing controllers for stochastic control systems over rich specifications expressed in linear temporal logic. Our technique enables automated, correct-by-construction, controller synthesis for stochastic control systems, which are common mathematical models employed in many safety critical systems subject to structured uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Sketching is a software synthesis approach where the programmer develops a partial implementation - a sketch - and a separate specification of the desired functionality. The synthesizer then completes the sketch to behave like the specification. The correctness of the synthesized implementation is guaranteed by the compiler, which allows, among other benefits, rapid development of highly tuned implementations without the fear of introducing bugs.We develop SKETCH, a language for finite programs with linguistic support for sketching. Finite programs include many highperformance kernels, including cryptocodes. In contrast to prior synthesizers, which had to be equipped with domain-specific rules, SKETCH completes sketches by means of a combinatorial search based on generalized boolean satisfiability. Consequently, our combinatorial synthesizer is complete for the class of finite programs: it is guaranteed to complete any sketch in theory, and in practice has scaled to realistic programming problems.Freed from domain rules, we can now write sketches as simpleto-understand partial programs, which are regular programs in which difficult code fragments are replaced with holes to be filled by the synthesizer. Holes may stand for index expressions, lookup tables, or bitmasks, but the programmer can easily define new kinds of holes using a single versatile synthesis operator.We have used SKETCH to synthesize an efficient implementation of the AES cipher standard. The synthesizer produces the most complex part of the implementation and runs in about an hour.},

We present a technique for discovering Lyapunov functions and barrier certificates for nonlinear and hybrid dynamical systems using a search-based approach. Our approach uses concrete executions, such as those obtained through simulation, to formulate a series of linear programming (LP) optimization problems; the solution to each LP creates a candidate Lyapunov function. Intermediate candidates are iteratively improved using a global optimizer guided by the Lie derivative of the candidate Lyapunov function. The analysis is refined using counterexamples from a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver. When no counterexamples are found, the soundness of the analysis is verified using an arithmetic solver. The technique can be applied to a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems, including hybrid systems and systems with polynomial and even transcendental dynamics. We present several examples illustrating the efficacy of the technique, including two automotive powertrain control examples.},

  abstract = {Control systems are usually modeled by differential equations describing how physical phenomena can be influenced by certain control parameters or inputs. Although these models are very powerful when dealing with physical phenomena, they are less suitable to describe software and hardware interfacing the physical world. For this reason there is a growing interest in describing control systems through symbolic models that are abstract descriptions of the continuous dynamics, where each ``symbol'' corresponds to an ``aggregate'' of states in the continuous model. Since these symbolic models are of the same nature of the models used in computer science to describe software and hardware, they provide a unified language to study problems of control in which software and hardware interact with the physical world. Furthermore the use of symbolic models enables one to leverage techniques from supervisory control and algorithms from game theory for controller synthesis purposes. In this paper we show that every incrementally globally asymptotically stable nonlinear control system is approximately equivalent (bisimilar) to a symbolic model. The approximation error is a design parameter in the construction of the symbolic model and can be rendered as small as desired. Furthermore if the state space of the control system is bounded the obtained symbolic model is finite. For digital control systems, and under the stronger assumption of incremental input\textendash to\textendash state stability, symbolic models can be constructed through a suitable quantization of the inputs.},

  abstract = {Elementary hybrid systems (EHSs) are those hybrid systems (HSs) containing elementary functions such as exp, ln, sin, cos, etc. EHSs are very common in practice, especially in safety-critical domains. Due to the non-polynomial expressions which lead to undecidable arithmetic, verification of EHSs is very hard. Existing approaches based on partition of the state space or overapproximation of reachable sets suffer from state space explosion or inflation of numerical errors. In this paper, we propose a symbolic abstraction approach that reduces EHSs to polynomial hybrid systems (PHSs), by replacing all non-polynomial terms with newly introduced variables. Thus the verification of EHSs is reduced to the one of PHSs, enabling us to apply all the well-established verification techniques and tools for PHSs to EHSs. In this way, it is possible to avoid the limitations of many existing methods. We illustrate the abstraction approach and its application in safety verification of EHSs by several real world examples.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we focus on finding positive invari-ants and Lyapunov functions to establish reachability and stability properties, respectively, of polynomial ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In general, the search for such functions is a hard problem. As a result, numerous techniques have been developed to search for polynomial differential variants that yield positive invariants and polynomial Lyapunov functions that prove stability, for systems defined by polynomial differential equations. However, the systematic search for non-polynomial functions is considered a much harder problem, and has received much less attention. In this paper, we combine ideas from computer algebra with the Sum-Of-Squares (SOS) relaxation for polynomial positive semi-definiteness to find non polynomial differential variants and Lyapunov functions for polynomial ODEs. Using the well-known concept of Darboux polynomials, we show how Darboux polynomials can, in many instances, naturally lead to specific forms of Lyapunov functions that involve rational function, logarithmic and exponential terms. We demonstrate the value of our approach by deriving non-polynomial Lyapunov functions for numerical examples drawn from the literature.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has had a far reaching impact in robotics. Specifically, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been highly effective in synthesizing neural-network controllers for a wide range of tasks. However, despite this empirical success, these controllers still lack theoretical guarantees on their performance, such as Lyapunov stability (i.e., all trajectories of the closed-loop system are guaranteed to converge to a goal state under the control policy). This is in stark contrast to traditional model-based controller design, where principled approaches (like LQR) can synthesize stable controllers with provable guarantees. To address this gap, we propose a generic method to synthesize a Lyapunov-stable neural-network controller, together with a neural-network Lyapunov function to simultaneously certify its stability. Our approach formulates the Lyapunov condition verification as a mixed-integer linear program (MIP). Our MIP verifier either certifies the Lyapunov condition, or generates counter examples that can help improve the candidate controller and the Lyapunov function. We also present an optimization program to compute an inner approximation of the region of attraction for the closed-loop system. We apply our approach to robots including an inverted pendulum, a 2D and a 3D quadrotor, and showcase that our neural-network controller outperforms a baseline LQR controller.

  abstract = {This paper introduces robustness verification for semantic segmentation neural networks (in short, semantic segmentation networks [SSNs]), building on and extending recent approaches for robustness verification of image classification neural networks. Despite recent progress in developing verification methods for specifications such as local adversarial robustness in deep neural networks (DNNs) in terms of scalability, precision, and applicability to different network architectures, layers, and activation functions, robustness verification of semantic segmentation has not yet been considered. We address this limitation by developing and applying new robustness analysis methods for several segmentation neural network architectures, specifically by addressing reachability analysis of up-sampling layers, such as transposed convolution and dilated convolution. We consider several definitions of robustness for segmentation, such as the percentage of pixels in the output that can be proven robust under different adversarial perturbations, and a robust variant of intersection-over-union (IoU), the typical performance evaluation measure for segmentation tasks. Our approach is based on a new relaxed reachability method, allowing users to select the percentage of a number of linear programming problems (LPs) to solve when constructing the reachable set, through a relaxation factor percentage. The approach is implemented within NNV, then applied and evaluated on segmentation datasets, such as a multi-digit variant of MNIST known as M2NIST. Thorough experiments show that by using transposed convolution for up-sampling and average-pooling for down-sampling, combined with minimizing the number of ReLU layers in the SSNs, we can obtain SSNs with not only high accuracy (IoU), but also that are more robust to adversarial attacks and amenable to verification. Additionally, using our new relaxed reachability method, we can significantly reduce the verification time for neural networks whose ReLU layers dominate the total analysis time, even in classification tasks.},

The learning framework uses a demonstrator that implements a black-box, untrusted strategy presumed to solve the problem of interest, a learner that poses finitely many queries to the demonstrator to infer a candidate function, and a verifier that checks whether the current candidate is a valid control Lyapunov-like function. The overall learning framework is iterative, eliminating a set of candidates on each iteration using the counterexamples discovered by the verifier and the demonstrations over these counterexamples. We prove its convergence using ellipsoidal approximation techniques from convex optimization. We also implement this scheme using nonlinear MPC controllers to serve as demonstrators for a set of state and trajectory stabilization problems for nonlinear dynamical systems. We show how the verifier can be constructed efficiently using convex relaxations of the verification problem for polynomial systems to semi-definite programming problem instances. Our approach is able to synthesize relatively simple polynomial control Lyapunov-like functions, and in that process replace the MPC using a guaranteed and computationally less expensive controller.},

First, we introduce a class of control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for switched systems along with a switching strategy that yields a closed loop system with a guaranteed minimum dwell time in each switching mode. However, the challenge lies in automatically synthesizing appropriate CLFs. Assuming a given fixed form for the CLF with unknown coefficients, we derive quantified nonlinear constraints whose feasible solutions (if any) correspond to CLFs for the original system. However, solving quantified nonlinear constraints pose a challenge to most LMI/BMI-based relaxations. Therefore, we investigate a general approach called Counter-Example Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS), that has been widely used in the emerging area of automatic program synthesis. We show how a LMI-based relaxation can be formulated within the CEGIS framework for synthesizing CLFs. We also evaluate our approach on a number of interesting benchmarks, and compare the performance of the new approach with our previous work that uses off-the-shelf nonlinear constraint solvers instead of the LMI relaxation. The results shows synthesizing CLFs by using LMI solvers inside a CEGIS framework can be a computational feasible approach to synthesizing CLFs.},

The Lyapunov functions we synthesize are parameterized by feedforward neural networks with leaky ReLU activation units. To train these neural networks, we design a loss function that measures the maximal violation of the Lyapunov conditions in the state space. We show that this maximal violation can be computed by solving a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Compared to previous learning-based approaches, our learning approach is able to certify with high precision that the learned neural network satisfies the Lyapunov conditions not only for sampled states, but over the entire state space. Moreover, compared to previous optimization-based approaches that require a pre-specified partition of the state space when synthesizing piecewise Lyapunov functions, our method can automatically search for both the partition and the Lyapunov function simultaneously. We demonstrate our algorithm on both continuous and discrete-time systems, including some for which known strategies for partitioning of the Lyapunov function would require introducing higher order Lyapunov functions.},

  abstract = {We propose a sampling-based approach to learn Lyapunov functions for a class of discrete-time autonomous hybrid systems that admit a mixed-integer representation. Such systems include autonomous piecewise affine systems, closed-loop dynamics of linear systems with model predictive controllers, piecewise affine/linear complementarity/mixed-logical dynamical systems in feedback with a ReLU neural network controller, etc. The proposed method comprises an alternation between a learner and a verifier to search for a Lyapunov function from a family of parameterized Lyapunov function candidates. In each iteration, the learner uses a collection of state samples to select a Lyapunov function candidate through a convex program in the parameter space. The verifier then solves a nonconvex mixed-integer quadratic program in the state space to either validate the proposed Lyapunov function candidate or reject it with a counterexample, i.e., a state where the Lyapunov condition fails. This counterexample is then added to the sample set of the learner to refine the set of Lyapunov function candidates in the next iteration. By designing the learner and the verifier according to the analytic center cutting-plane method from convex optimization, we show that when the set of Lyapunov functions is full-dimensional in the parameter space, our method finds a Lyapunov function in a finite number of steps. We demonstrate our stability analysis method on closed-loop MPC dynamical systems and a ReLU neural network controlled PWA system.},

abstract = {Reachability analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems is a challenging and computationally expensive task. Computing the reachable states for linear systems, in contrast, can often be done efficiently in high dimensions. In this paper, we explore verification methods that leverage a connection between these two classes of systems based on the concept of the Koopman operator. The Koopman operator links the behaviors of a nonlinear system to a linear system embedded in a higher dimensional space, with an additional set of so-called observable variables. Although the new dynamical system has linear differential equations, the set of initial states is defined with nonlinear constraints. For this reason, existing approaches for linear systems reachability cannot be used directly. We propose the first reachability algorithm that deals with this unexplored type of reachability problem. Our evaluation examines several optimizations, and shows the proposed workflow is a promising avenue for verifying behaviors of nonlinear systems.}

The proposed tool differs from existing ones because it relies on a sound theoretical basis for the semantics of operators in continuous space and time, making available exact and approximate, but error-bounded operations on geometric points and sets.

  abstract = {The expressive power of neural networks is important for understanding deep learning. Most existing works consider this problem from the view of the depth of a network. In this paper, we study how width affects the expressiveness of neural networks. Classical results state that depth-bounded (e.g. depth-2) networks with suitable activation functions are universal approximators. We show a universal approximation theorem for width-bounded ReLU networks: width-(n + 4) ReLU networks, where n is the input dimension, are universal approximators. Moreover, except for a measure zero set, all functions cannot be approximated by width-n ReLU networks, which exhibits a phase transition. Several recent works demonstrate the benefits of depth by proving the depth-efficiency of neural networks. That is, there are classes of deep networks which cannot be realized by any shallow network whose size is no more than an exponential bound. Here we pose the dual question on the width-efficiency of ReLU networks: Are there wide networks that cannot be realized by narrow networks whose size is not substantially larger? We show that there exist classes of wide networks which cannot be realized by any narrow network whose depth is no more than a polynomial bound. On the other hand, we demonstrate by extensive experiments that narrow networks whose size exceed the polynomial bound by a constant factor can approximate wide and shallow network with high accuracy. Our results provide more comprehensive evidence that depth may be more effective than width for the expressiveness of ReLU networks.}

The two contributions to this total risk are the approximation error and the estimation error. Approximation error refers to the distance between the target function and the closest neural network function of a given architecture and estimation error refers to the distance between this ideal network function and an estimated network function. Withn {$\sim$} Cf(N/(d logN))1/2 nodes, the order of the bound on the mean integrated squared error is optimized to beO(Cf((d/N) logN)1/2). The bound demonstrates surprisingly favorable properties of network estimation compared to traditional series and nonparametric curve estimation techniques in the case thatd is moderately large. Similar bounds are obtained when the number of nodesn is not preselected as a function ofCf(which is generally not knowna priori), but rather the number of nodes is optimized from the observed data by the use of a complexity regularization or minimum description length criterion. The analysis involves Fourier techniques for the approximation error, metric entropy considerations for the estimation error, and a calculation of the index of resolvability of minimum complexity estimation of the family of networks.},

In this paper, we consider a general class of neural ODEs with varying architectures and layers, and introduce a novel reachability framework that allows for the formal analysis of their behavior. The methods developed for the reachability analysis of neural ODEs are implemented in a new tool called NNVODE. Specifically, our work extends an existing neural network verification tool to support neural ODEs. We demonstrate the capabilities and efficacy of our methods through the analysis of a set of benchmarks that include neural ODEs used for classification, and in control and dynamical systems, including an evaluation of the efficacy and capabilities of our approach with respect to existing software tools within the continuous-time systems reachability literature, when it is possible to do so.},
