  "abstract": "Generative language models produce highly abstractive outputs by design, in contrast to extractive responses in search engines. Given this characteristic of LLMs and the resulting implications for content Licensing & Attribution, we propose the the so-called Extractive-Abstractive axis for benchmarking generative models and highlight the need for developing corresponding metrics, datasets and annotation guidelines. We limit our discussion to the text modality.",
