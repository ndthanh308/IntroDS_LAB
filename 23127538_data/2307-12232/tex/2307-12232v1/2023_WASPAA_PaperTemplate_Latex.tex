\begin{abstract}
  In order to help authors prepare their manuscripts for
  submission to WASPAA 2023 and generate IEEE Xplore-compatible
  PDFs, we compile a list of guidelines and put together two
  templates for users of both \LaTeX\ and Microsoft Word, which
  can be downloaded from the workshop website at \cite{waspaaweb}.
  These guidelines and templates are modified from those for
  ICASSP and past WASPAA workshops, so an experienced author who
  has published something in these conferences/workshops will
  find it easy to follow the guidelines and use the templates.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The guidelines given below, including complete descriptions of
the fonts, spacing, and related information for producing your
proceedings manuscripts, are critical to produce the WASPAA 2023
proceedings with a more uniform look and IEEE Xplore-compatible PDFs.

\section{Formatting your paper}
\label{sec:format}

All manuscripts must be submitted electronically as PDF files.
All manuscripts must be formatted for white US letter paper
(8.5 $\times$ 11 inches). Please do {\bf not} use A4-size papers.
All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts,
must be kept within a print area of 7.0 inches (178 mm) wide
by 8.9 inches (226 mm) high. Do not write or print anything outside
the print area. The top margin must be 1 inch (25 mm), except for
the title page, and the left margin must be 0.75 inch (19 mm).
All {\it text} must be in a two-column format. Columns are to be
3.29 inches (83.5 mm) wide, with a 0.31 inch (8 mm) space between
them. Text must be fully justified.

\section{PDF EXPRESS}
\label{sec:PDF_express}

Accepted papers must pass IEEE PDF Express $^{\text{TM}}$ format
verification prior to publication.  Format verification details will be
announced with paper acceptance notification.

\section{COPYRIGHT FORMS}
\label{sec:copyright}

You must submit a fully completed, signed IEEE
copyright release form after your manuscript is
selected for presentation on the workshop.
We {\bf must} have this form before your paper can be
published in the proceedings. The copyright form is
available as a Word file, a PDF file, and an HTML file
at \cite{ieeecopyright}.
%\url{http://www.ieee.org/web/publications/rights/copyrightmain.html}.
Copyright form submission details will be announced with paper acceptance notification.

\section{NUMBER OF PAGES}
\label{sec:pagelimit}

You are allowed a total of 5 pages for your document. Up to 4 pages may
contain technical content, figures, and references, while the 5th page
may contain only references. This is the max-imum number of pages that
will be accepted, including all figures, tables, and references. Any
documents that exceed the 5-page limit will be rejected. Any documents
with a 5th page containing anything other than references will be rejected.


\section{PAGE TITLE SECTION}
\label{sec:pagestyle}

The paper title (on the first page) should begin 0.98 inches
(25 mm) from the top edge of the page, centered, completely
capitalized, and in Times 14-point, boldface type.
The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear below the title
in capital and lower case letters.  Papers with multiple authors
and affiliations may require two or more lines for this information.

\section{TYPE-STYLE AND FONTS}
\label{sec:typestyle}

To achieve the best rendering both in the proceedings and
from the CD-ROM, we strongly encourage you to use Times-Roman
font. In addition, this will give the proceedings a more uniform
look. Use a font that is no smaller than nine point type
throughout the paper, including figure captions.

In nine point type font, capital letters are 2 mm high.
{\bf If you use the smallest point size, there should be
no more than 3.2 lines/cm (8 lines/inch) vertically.}
This is a minimum spacing; 2.75 lines/cm (7 lines/inch)
will make the paper much more readable. Larger type sizes
require correspondingly larger vertical spacing. Please do
not double-space your paper. True-Type 1 fonts are preferred.

The first paragraph in each section should not be indented,
but all the following paragraphs within the section should
be indented as these paragraphs demonstrate.

\section{MAJOR HEADINGS}
\label{sec:majhead}

Major headings, for example, ``1. Introduction'', should
appear in all capital letters, bold face if possible,
centered in the column, with one blank line before,
and one blank line after. Use a period (``.'') after
the heading number, not a colon.

\subsection{Subheadings}
\label{ssec:subhead}

Subheadings should appear in lower case (initial word
capitalized) in boldface. They should start at the left
margin on a separate line.

\subsubsection{Sub-subheadings}
\label{sssec:subsubhead}

Sub-subheadings, as in this paragraph, are discouraged.
However, if you must use them, they should appear in
lower case (initial word capitalized) and start at the
left margin on a separate line, with paragraph
text beginning on the following line. They should be
in italics.


\section{Page Numbering, Header, and Footer}
\label{sec:page}

Please do {\bf not} paginate your paper. Page numbers,
session numbers, and conference identification will be
inserted when the paper is included in the proceedings.
In addition, please do {\bf not} change and remove
the header and footer.

\section{ILLUSTRATIONS, GRAPHS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS}
\label{sec:illust}

Illustrations must appear within the designated margins.
They may span the two columns. If possible, position
illustrations at the top of columns, rather than in
the middle or at the bottom. Caption and number every
illustration. All halftone illustrations must be clear
black and white prints. Colors may be used, but they
should be selected so as to be readable when printed
on a black-only printer.

Since there are many ways, often incompatible, of
including images (e.g., with experimental results)
in a \LaTeX\ document, an example of how to do
this is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:results}.

% Below is an example of how to insert images.

\section{Equations}
\label{sec:equations}

Equations should be placed on separate lines and consecutively
numbered with equation numbers in parentheses flush with the
right margin, as illustrated in (\ref{eqn:wave_equation})
that gives the homogeneous acoustic wave equation in
Cartesian coordinates \cite{eWilliams1999},
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:wave_equation}
    \Delta^2p(x,y,z,t)-
    \displaystyle\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2p(x,y,z,t)}{\partial t^2}=0,
\end{equation}
where $p(x,y,z,t)$ is an infinitesimal variation of acoustic
pressure from its equilibrium value at position $(x,y,z)$ and
time $t$, and where $c$ denotes the speed of sound.

Symbols in your equation should be defined before the equation
appears or immediately following.  Use (1), not Eq. (1) or
equation (1), except at the beginning of a sentence:
``Equation (1) is ...''



\section{FOOTNOTES}
\label{sec:foot}

Use footnotes sparingly (or not at all!) and place them at
the bottom of the column on the page on which they are
referenced. Use Times 9-point type, single-spaced. To
help your readers, avoid using footnotes altogether and
include necessary peripheral observations in the text
(within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).


\section{REFERENCES}
\label{sec:ref}

List and number all bibliographical references at the end
of the paper. The references should be numbered in order
of appearance in the document. When referring to them in
the text, type the corresponding reference number in
square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence
\cite{cJones2003}, \cite{aSmith2000}. For \LaTeX\ users,
the use of the Bib\TeX\ style file IEEEtran.bst is
recommended, which is included in the \LaTeX\ paper
kit available from the workshop website \cite{waspaaweb}.

\section{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}
\label{sec:ack}

The preferred spelling of the word acknowledgment in
America is without an ``e'' after the ``g.'' Try to avoid
the stilted expression, ``One of us (R. B. G.) thanks ...''
Instead, try ``R.B.G.\ thanks ...''  Put sponsor
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
