Torch is a machine learning library providing a series of the state-of-the-art algorithms such as Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Mixture Models, Hidden Markov Models and many others. Torchvision provides additional functionalities to manipulate and process images with standard image processing algorithms. Hence, the resulting images can be used directly with the Torch machine learning algorithms as Torchvision is fully integrated with Torch.

abstract = {The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge is a benchmark in visual object category recognition and detection, providing the vision and machine learning communities with a standard dataset of images and annotation, and standard evaluation procedures. Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection.This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension.},

abstract = {For many KDD applications, such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce, finding the rare instances or the outliers, can be more interesting than finding the common patterns. Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

abstract = {Outlier detection is an important topic in machine learning and has been used in a wide range of applications. In this paper, we approach outlier detection as a binary-classification issue by sampling potential outliers from a uniform reference distribution. However, due to the sparsity of data in high-dimensional space, a limited number of potential outliers may fail to provide sufficient information to assist the classifier in describing a boundary that can separate outliers from normal data effectively. To address this, we propose a novel Single-Objective Generative Adversarial Active Learning (SO-GAAL) method for outlier detection, which can directly generate informative potential outliers based on the mini-max game between a generator and a discriminator. Moreover, to prevent the generator from falling into the mode collapsing problem, the stop node of training should be determined when SO-GAAL is able to provide sufficient information. But without any prior information, it is extremely difficult for SO-GAAL. Therefore, we expand the network structure of SO-GAAL from a single generator to multiple generators with different objectives (MO-GAAL), which can generate a reasonable reference distribution for the whole dataset. We empirically compare the proposed approach with several state-of-the-art outlier detection methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that MO-GAAL outperforms its competitors in the majority of cases, especially for datasets with various cluster types or high irrelevant variable ratio. The experiment codes are available at: https://github.com/leibinghe/GAAL-based-outlier-detection.},

abstract="In traditional supervised learning, one uses ''labeled'' data to build a model. However, labeling the training data for real-world applications is difficult, expensive, or time consuming, as it requires the effort of human annotators sometimes with specific domain experience and training. There are implicit costs associated with obtaining these labels from domain experts, such as limited time and financial resources. This is especially true for applications that involve learning with large number of class labels and sometimes with similarities among them. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) addresses this inherent bottleneck by allowing the model to integrate part or all of the available unlabeled data in its supervised learning. The goal is to maximize the learning performance of the model through such newly-labeled examples while minimizing the work required of human annotators. Exploiting unlabeled data to help improve the learning performance has become a hot topic during the last decade and it is divided into four main directions: SSL with graphs, SSL with generative models, semi-supervised support vector machines and SSL by disagreement (SSL with committees). This survey article provides an overview to research advances in this branch of machine learning.",
