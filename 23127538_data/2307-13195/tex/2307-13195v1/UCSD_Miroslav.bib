  abstract = {This paper develops an output feedback control law in order to damp out traffic oscillations in the congested regime of the linearized two-class Aw-Rascle (AR) traffic model. The macroscopic secondorder two-class AR traffic model consists of four hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the dynamics of densities and velocities on freeway. Each vehicle class is characterized by its own vehicle size and driver’s behavior. The considered equilibrium profiles of the model represent evenly distributed traffic with constant densities and velocities of both classes along the investigated track section. After linearizing the model equations around those equilibrium profiles, it is observed that in the congested traffic one of the four characteristic speeds is negative, whereas the remaining three are positive. Backstepping control design is employed to stabilize the 4 × 4 heterodirectional hyperbolic PDEs. The control input actuates the traffic flow at outlet of the investigated track section and is realized by a ramp metering. The output feedback controller is obtained by designing an anticollocated observer and combining it with a full state feedback result. Overall, the output feedback control law achieves the damping of stop-and-go waves in finite time by measuring the velocities and densities of both vehicle classes at the inlet of the investigated track section. The performance of the developed controller is verified by simulation of the linearized model and quantified by performance indices for the fuel consumption, comfort and total travel time.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a wave of research activities in systems science toward the study of population systems. The driving force behind this shift was geared by numerous emerging and ever-changing technologies in life and physical sciences and engineering, from neuroscience, biology, and quantum physics to robotics, where many control-enabled applications involve manipulating a large ensemble of structurally identical dynamic units, or agents. Analyzing fundamental properties of ensemble control systems in turn plays a foundational and critical role in enabling and, further, advancing these applications, and the analysis is largely beyond the capability of classical control techniques. In this paper, we consider an ensemble of time-invariant linear systems evolving on an infinite-dimensional space of continuous functions. We exploit the notion of separating points and techniques of polynomial approximation to develop necessary and sufficient ensemble controllability conditions. In particular, we introduce an extended notion of controllability matrix, called Ensemble Controllability Gramian. This means enables the characterization of ensemble controllability through evaluating controllability of each individual system in the ensemble. As a result, the work provides a unified framework with a systematic procedure for analyzing control systems defined on an infinite-dimensional space by a finite-dimensional approach.},
