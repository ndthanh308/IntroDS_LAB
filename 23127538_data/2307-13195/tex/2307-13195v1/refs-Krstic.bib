abstract={It is widely known that neural networks (NNs) are universal approximators of continuous functions. However, a less known but powerful result is that a NN with a single hidden layer can accurately approximate any nonlinear continuous operator. This universal approximation theorem of operators is suggestive of the structure and potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) in learning continuous operators or complex systems from streams of scattered data. Here, we thus extend this theorem to DNNs. We design a new network with small generalization error, the deep operator network (DeepONet), which consists of a DNN for encoding the discrete input function space (branch net) and another DNN for encoding the domain of the output functions (trunk net). We demonstrate that DeepONet can learn various explicit operators, such as integrals and fractional Laplacians, as well as implicit operators that represent deterministic and stochastic differential equations. We study different formulations of the input function space and its effect on the generalization error for 16 different diverse applications.},

abstract = {Enabling the rapid emulation of parametric differential equations with physics-informed deep operator networks. Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a central role in the mathematical analysis and modeling of complex dynamic processes across all corners of science and engineering. Their solution often requires laborious analytical or computational tools, associated with a cost that is markedly amplified when different scenarios need to be investigated, for example, corresponding to different initial or boundary conditions, different inputs, etc. In this work, we introduce physics-informed DeepONets, a deep learning framework for learning the solution operator of arbitrary PDEs, even in the absence of any paired input-output training data. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in rapidly predicting the solution of various types of parametric PDEs up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to conventional PDE solvers, setting a previously unexplored paradigm for modeling and simulation of nonlinear and nonequilibrium processes in science and engineering.}}

    abstract = "{DeepONets have recently been proposed as a framework for learning nonlinear operators mapping between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. We analyze DeepONets and prove estimates on the resulting approximation and generalization errors. In particular, we extend the universal approximation property of DeepONets to include measurable mappings in non-compact spaces. By a decomposition of the error into encoding, approximation and reconstruction errors, we prove both lower and upper bounds on the total error, relating it to the spectral decay properties of the covariance operators, associated with the underlying measures. We derive almost optimal error bounds with very general affine reconstructors and with random sensor locations as well as bounds on the generalization error, using covering number arguments. We illustrate our general framework with four prototypical examples of nonlinear operators, namely those arising in a nonlinear forced ordinary differential equation, an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) with variable coefficients and nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs. While the approximation of arbitrary Lipschitz operators by DeepONets to accuracy \\$\\epsilon \\$ is argued to suffer from a ‘curse of dimensionality’ (requiring a neural networks of exponential size in \\$1/\\epsilon \\$), in contrast, for all the above concrete examples of interest, we rigorously prove that DeepONets can break this curse of dimensionality (achieving accuracy \\$\\epsilon \\$ with neural networks of size that can grow algebraically in \\$1/\\epsilon \\$).Thus, we demonstrate the efficient approximation of a potentially large class of operators with this machine learning framework.}",

abstract={Extreme events in society and nature, such as pandemic spikes, rogue waves or structural failures, can have catastrophic consequences. Characterizing extremes is difficult, as they occur rarely, arise from seemingly benign conditions, and belong to complex and often unknown infinite-dimensional systems. Such challenges render attempts at characterizing them moot. We address each of these difficulties by combining output-weighted training schemes in Bayesian experimental design (BED) with an ensemble of deep neural operators. This model-agnostic framework pairs a BED scheme that actively selects data for quantifying extreme events with an ensemble of deep neural operators that approximate infinite-dimensional nonlinear operators. We show that not only does this framework outperform Gaussian processes, but that (1) shallow ensembles of just two members perform best; (2) extremes are uncovered regardless of the state of the initial data (that is, with or without extremes); (3) our method eliminates `double-descent' phenomena; (4) the use of batches of suboptimal acquisition samples compared to step-by-step global optima does not hinder BED performance; and (5) Monte Carlo acquisition outperforms standard optimizers in high dimensions. Together, these conclusions form a scalable artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted experimental infrastructure that can efficiently infer and pinpoint critical situations across many domains, from physical to societal systems.},

When learning a dynamical system, one needs to stabilize the unknown dynamics in order to avoid system blow-ups. We propose an algorithm that certifies fast stabilization of the underlying system by effectively exploring the environment with an improved exploration strategy. We show that the proposed algorithm attains $\Tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret after $T$ time steps of agent-environment interaction. We also show that the regret of the proposed algorithm has only a polynomial dependence in the problem dimensions, which gives an exponential improvement over the prior methods. Our improved exploration method is simple, yet efficient, and it combines a sophisticated exploration policy in RL with an isotropic exploration strategy to achieve fast stabilization and improved regret. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other popular methods in several adaptive control tasks. }}

abstract = {Controller design faces a trade-off between robustness and performance, and the reliability of linear controllers has caused many practitioners to focus on the former. However, there is renewed interest in improving system performance to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty, and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the true dynamics.}

abstract = {We propose a sampling-based approach to learn Lyapunov functions for a class of discrete-time autonomous hybrid systems that admit a mixed-integer representation. Such systems include autonomous piecewise affine systems, closed-loop dynamics of linear systems with model predictive controllers, piecewise affine/linear complementarity/mixed-logical dynamical systems in feedback with a ReLU neural network controller, etc. The proposed method comprises an alternation between a learner and a verifier to search for a Lyapunov function from a family of parameterized Lyapunov function candidates. In each iteration, the learner uses a collection of state samples to select a Lyapunov function candidate through a convex program in the parameter space. The verifier then solves a nonconvex mixed-integer quadratic program in the state space to either validate the proposed Lyapunov function candidate or reject it with a counterexample, i.e., a state where the Lyapunov condition fails. This counterexample is then added to the sample set of the learner to refine the set of Lyapunov function candidates in the next iteration. By designing the learner and the verifier according to the analytic center cutting-plane method from convex optimization, we show that when the set of Lyapunov functions is full-dimensional in the parameter space, our method finds a Lyapunov function in a finite number of steps. We demonstrate our stability analysis method on closed-loop MPC dynamical systems and a ReLU neural network controlled PWA system.},

abstract = {Most cyber–physical systems (CPS) encounter a large volume of data which is added to the system gradually in real time and not altogether in advance. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that yields optimal control strategies for such CPS at the intersection of control theory and learning. In the proposed framework, we use the actual CPS, i.e., the “true” system that we seek to optimally control online, in parallel with a model of the CPS that is available. We then institute an information state for the system which does not depend on the control strategy. An important consequence of this independence is that for any given choice of a control strategy and a realization of the system’s variables until time t, the information states at future times do not depend on the choice of the control strategy at time t but only on the realization of the decision at time t, and thus they are related to the concept of separation between estimation of the state and control. Namely, the future information states are separated from the choice of the current control strategy. Such control strategies are called separated control strategies. Hence, we can derive offline the optimal control strategy of the system with respect to the information state, which might not be precisely known due to model uncertainties or complexity of the system, and then use standard learning approaches to learn the information state online while data are added gradually to the system in real time. We show that after the information state becomes known, the separated control strategy of the CPS model derived offline is optimal for the actual system. We illustrate the proposed framework in a dynamic system consisting of two subsystems with a delayed sharing information structure.}

By means of policy iteration (PI) for CTLP systems, both on-policy and off-policy adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithms are derived, such that the solution of the optimal control problem can be found without the exact knowledge of the system dynamics. Starting with initial stabilizing controllers, the proposed PI-based ADP algorithms converge to the optimal solutions under mild conditions. Application to the adaptive optimal control of the lossy Mathieu equation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed learning-based adaptive optimal control algorithm.}

Identifying governing equations from data is a critical step in the modeling and control of complex dynamical systems. Here, we investigate the data-driven identification of nonlinear dynamical systems with inputs and forcing using regression methods, including sparse regression. Specifically, we generalize the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) algorithm to include external inputs and feedback control. This method is demonstrated on examples including the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model and the Lorenz system with forcing and control. We also connect the present algorithm with the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and Koopman operator theory to provide a broader context.}

  abstract = 	 {We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.}

  abstract = {This paper develops an output feedback control law in order to damp out traffic oscillations in the congested regime of the linearized two-class Aw-Rascle (AR) traffic model. The macroscopic secondorder two-class AR traffic model consists of four hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the dynamics of densities and velocities on freeway. Each vehicle class is characterized by its own vehicle size and driver’s behavior. The considered equilibrium profiles of the model represent evenly distributed traffic with constant densities and velocities of both classes along the investigated track section. After linearizing the model equations around those equilibrium profiles, it is observed that in the congested traffic one of the four characteristic speeds is negative, whereas the remaining three are positive. Backstepping control design is employed to stabilize the 4 × 4 heterodirectional hyperbolic PDEs. The control input actuates the traffic flow at outlet of the investigated track section and is realized by a ramp metering. The output feedback controller is obtained by designing an anticollocated observer and combining it with a full state feedback result. Overall, the output feedback control law achieves the damping of stop-and-go waves in finite time by measuring the velocities and densities of both vehicle classes at the inlet of the investigated track section. The performance of the developed controller is verified by simulation of the linearized model and quantified by performance indices for the fuel consumption, comfort and total travel time.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a wave of research activities in systems science toward the study of population systems. The driving force behind this shift was geared by numerous emerging and ever-changing technologies in life and physical sciences and engineering, from neuroscience, biology, and quantum physics to robotics, where many control-enabled applications involve manipulating a large ensemble of structurally identical dynamic units, or agents. Analyzing fundamental properties of ensemble control systems in turn plays a foundational and critical role in enabling and, further, advancing these applications, and the analysis is largely beyond the capability of classical control techniques. In this paper, we consider an ensemble of time-invariant linear systems evolving on an infinite-dimensional space of continuous functions. We exploit the notion of separating points and techniques of polynomial approximation to develop necessary and sufficient ensemble controllability conditions. In particular, we introduce an extended notion of controllability matrix, called Ensemble Controllability Gramian. This means enables the characterization of ensemble controllability through evaluating controllability of each individual system in the ensemble. As a result, the work provides a unified framework with a systematic procedure for analyzing control systems defined on an infinite-dimensional space by a finite-dimensional approach.},
