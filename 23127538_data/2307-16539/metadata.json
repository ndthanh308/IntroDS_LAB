  "abstract": "In this paper, continuous binary operations of a topological space are studied and a criterion of their invertibility is proved. The classification problem of groups of invertible continuous binary operations of locally compact and locally connected spaces is solved. A theorem on the binary distributive representation of a topological group is also proved.",
