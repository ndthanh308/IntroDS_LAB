We have introduced an interactive framework for pixel-level editing for neural radiance fields supporting instant preview. Specifically, we exploit teacher-student distillation method to provide editing guidance, and design a two-stage training strategy to achieve instant network convergence to obtain coarse results as a preview. Unlike previous works, our method does not require any explicit proxy (such as mesh), improving interactivity and user friendliness. Our method also supports preserving shading effects on the edited surface. One limitation is that our method do not support complex view-dependent lighting effects such as specular reflections, and can not change the scene illumination, which can be improved by introducing intrinsic decomposition. Besides, our method does not handle the reconstruction failures (such as floating artifacts) of the original NeRF network.
