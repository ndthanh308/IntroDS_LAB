title = {Electron Halo and Strahl Formation in the Solar Wind by Resonant Interaction with Whistler Waves},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Observations of solar wind electron distribution functions (VDFs) reveal considerable deviations from a simple Maxwellian VDF. A thermal core and a suprathermal halo and antisunward, magnetic field-aligned beam, or "strahl," can be distinguished. At higher energies above 2 keV, a superhalo can even be observed. A kinetic description of electrons in the solar corona and wind, including resonant interaction between electrons and whistler waves, can reproduce an enhancement of suprathermal electron fluxes compared to the core flux. The whistler waves are assumed to be generated below the solar coronal base and propagate through the corona into interplanetary space. However, the resonance condition with these whistlers can only be fulfilled by electrons that move sunward. For antisunward-moving electrons, such a model lacks an efficient diffusion mechanism. The mirror force due to the opening magnetic field geometry of a solar coronal hole and in the solar wind focuses the electrons into a very narrow beam. This expectation of an extremely narrow beam is contradicted by observations of a "strahl" that has a finite width, and of an quasi-isotropic superhalo component. Thus, a diffusion mechanism for antisunward-moving electrons must exist in interplanetary space. In this paper, antisunward-propagating whistler waves are introduced into the kinetic model in order to provide this diffusion. Their wave power is estimated as a small fraction of the total wave power that is measured in interplanetary space. The kinetic results show that the whistler waves are capable of influencing the solar wind electron VDFs significantly, leading to the formation of both the halo and strahl populations and a more isotropic distribution at higher energies, in good agreement with solar wind observations.}

We demonstrate that the suprathermal electrons propagating from the Sun along the Parker-spiral magnetic field lines are progressively focused into a narrow strahl at heliospheric distances r ≲ 1 au, while at r ≳ 1 au the width of the strahl saturates due to Coulomb collisions and becomes independent of the distance. Our theory of the strahl broadening does not contain free parameters and it agrees with Wind observations of the strahl width at 1 au to within \\$15\\hbox\\{--\\}20\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$, for widths that are resolvable by the instrument. This indicates that Coulomb scattering, rather than anomalous turbulent diffusion, plays a dominant role in strahl formation in these observations. We further propose that the halo electron population at energies \\$K \\lesssim 200\\, \\, \\{\\rm eV\\}\\$ may be composed of electrons that ran away from the Sun as an electron strahl, but later ended up on magnetic field lines leading them back to the Sun. The halo electrons are therefore not produced locally; rather, they are the fast electrons trapped by magnetic field lines on global heliospheric scales. Through the effects of magnetic defocusing and Coulomb pitch-angle scattering, a narrow source distribution at large heliocentric distances appears nearly isotropic at distances ∼1 au. At larger energies \\$K \\gtrsim 200\\, \\, \\{\\rm eV\\}\\$, however, our theory indicates that the scattering provided by Coulomb collisions alone is not sufficient to isotropize a narrow sunward-propagating electron beam.}",

    abstract = "{The velocity particle distributions measured in situ in space plasmas deviate from Maxwellian (thermal) equilibrium, showing enhanced suprathermal tails that are well described by the standard Kappa-distribution (SKD). Despite its successful application, the SKD is frequently disputed due to a series of unphysical implications such as diverging velocity moments, preventing a macroscopic description of the plasma. The regularized Kappa-distribution (RKD) has been introduced to overcome these limitations, but the dispersion properties of RKD-plasmas have not yet been explored. In the present paper, we compute the wavenumber dispersion of the frequency and damping or growth rates for the electromagnetic modes in plasmas characterized by the RKD. This task is accomplished by using the grid-based kinetic dispersion solver LEOPARD (“Linear Electromagnetic Oscillations in Plasmas with Arbitrary Rotationally symmetric Distributions”) developed for arbitrary gyrotropic distributions [P. Astfalk and F. Jenko, J. Geophys. Res. 122, 89 (2017)]. By reproducing previous results obtained for the SKD and Maxwellian, we validate the functionality of the code. Furthermore, we apply the isotropic and anisotropic RKDs to investigate stable electromagnetic electron-cyclotron (EMEC) and ion-cyclotron (EMIC) modes, as well as temperature-anisotropy-driven instabilities, for both T⊥/T∥\\&gt;1 (EMEC and EMIC instabilities) and T⊥/T∥\\&lt;1 cases (proton and electron firehose instabilities), where ∥ and ⊥ denote directions parallel and perpendicular to the local time-averaged magnetic field. Provided that the cutoff parameter α is small enough, the results show that the RKDs reproduce the dispersion curves of the SKD plasmas at both qualitative and quantitative levels. For higher values, however, a physically significant deviation occurs.}",

    abstract = "{The heat flux instability is an electromagnetic mode excited by a relative drift between the protons and two-component core–halo electrons. The most prominent application may be in association with the solar wind where drifting electron velocity distributions are observed. The heat flux instability is somewhat analogous to the electrostatic Buneman or ion-acoustic instability driven by the net drift between the protons and bulk electrons, except that the heat flux instability operates in magnetized plasmas and possesses transverse electromagnetic polarization. The heat flux instability is also distinct from the electrostatic counterpart in that it requires two electron species with relative drifts with each other. In the literature, the heat flux instability is often called the ‘whistler’ heat flux instability, but it is actually polarized in the opposite sense to the whistler wave. This paper elucidates all of these fundamental plasma physical properties associated with the heat flux instability starting from a simple model, and gradually building up more complexity towards a solar wind-like distribution functions. It is found that the essential properties of the instability are already present in the cold counter-streaming electron model, and that the instability is absent if the protons are ignored. These instability characteristics are highly reminiscent of the electron firehose instability driven by excessive parallel temperature anisotropy, propagating in parallel direction with respect to the ambient magnetic field, except that the free energy source for the heat flux instability resides in the effective parallel pressure provided by the counter-streaming electrons.}",

    abstract = "{In this work, we analyse the kinetic stability of a solar wind electron distribution composed of core and strahl subpopulations. The core is modelled by a drifting Maxwellian distribution, while the strahl is modelled by an analytic function recently derived in (Horaites et al. 2018) from the collisional kinetic equation. We perform a numerical linear stability analysis using the LEOPARD solver (Astfalk \\&amp; Jenko 2017), which allows for arbitrary gyrotropic distribution functions in a magnetized plasma. In contrast with previous reports, we do not find evidence for a whistler instability directly associated with the electron strahl. This may be related to the more realistic shape of the electron strahl distribution function adopted in our work, as compared to previous studies. We, however, find that for typical solar wind conditions, the core–strahl distribution is unstable to the kinetic Alfvén and magnetosonic modes. The maximum growth rates for these instabilities occur at wavenumbers kdi ≲ 1 (where di is the ion inertial length), at moderately oblique angles of propagation, thus providing a potential source of kinetic-scale turbulence. We therefore suggest that if the whistler modes are invoked to explain anomalous scattering of strahl particles, these modes may appear as a result of nonlinear mode coupling and turbulent cascade originating at scales kdi ≲ 1.}",

	abstract = {The Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons experiment on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission measures the three-dimensional electron velocity distribution function. We derive the parameters of the core, halo, and strahl populations utilizing a combination of fitting to model distributions and numerical integration for ∼100,000 electron distributions measured near the Sun on the first two PSP orbits, which reached heliocentric distances as small as ∼0.17 au. As expected, the electron core density and temperature increase with decreasing heliocentric distance, while the ratio of electron thermal pressure to magnetic pressure (βe) decreases. These quantities have radial scaling consistent with previous observations farther from the Sun, with superposed variations associated with different solar wind streams. The density in the strahl also increases; however, the density of the halo plateaus and even decreases at perihelion, leading to a large strahl/halo ratio near the Sun. As at greater heliocentric distances, the core has a sunward drift relative to the proton frame, which balances the current carried by the strahl, satisfying the zero-current condition necessary to maintain quasi-neutrality. Many characteristics of the electron distributions near perihelion have trends with solar wind flow speed, βe, and/or collisional age. Near the Sun, some trends not clearly seen at 1 au become apparent, including anticorrelations between wind speed and both electron temperature and heat flux. These trends help us understand the mechanisms that shape the solar wind electron distributions at an early stage of their evolution.}

    abstract = "{In situ observations reveal the existence of electron velocity distribution function in the solar wind, where the net distribution can be modelled by a combination of core, halo and strahl. These components often possess a relative drift and with respective temperature anisotropies. The relative drift between the core and halo components leads to heat flux (HF) instability, while temperature anisotropies drive electromagnetic electron-cyclotron (EMEC) instability. These instabilities have been separately studied in the literature, but for the first time, the present study combines both unstable modes in the presence of two free energy sources, namely, excessive parallel pressure and excessive perpendicular temperature. HF instability (which is a left-hand circularly polarized mode) is effectively similar to electron firehose instability, except that the free energy is provided by net relative drift among two component electrons in the background of protons. The HF instability is discussed here along with (the right-hand polarized) EMEC instability driven by temperature anisotropy. The unstable HF mode is conventionally termed the ‘whistler’ HF instability, but it is actually polarized in the opposite sense to the whistler wave. EMEC mode, on the other hand, reduces to the proper whistler wave in the absence of free energy source. The present combined analysis clarifies the polarization characteristics of these two modes in an unambiguous manner.}",

journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {Kappa distributions are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical poorly collisional plasmas, such as the solar wind, suggesting that microscopic and macroscopic properties of these non-equilibrium plasmas are highly conditioned by the wave–particle interactions. The present work addresses the evolution of anisotropic bi-Kappa (or bi-κ-)distributions of electrons triggering instabilities of electromagnetic electron-cyclotron (or whistler) modes. The new quasi-linear approach proposed here includes time variations of the κ parameter during the relaxation of temperature anisotropy. Numerical results show that κ may increase for short interval of times at the beginning, but then decreases toward a value lower than the initial one, while the plasma beta and temperature anisotropy indicate a systematic relaxation. Our results suggest that the electromagnetic turbulence plays an important role on the suprathermalization of the plasma, ultimately lowering the parameter κ. Even though the variation of κ is in general negative () this variation seems to depend of the initial conditions of anisotropic electrons, which can vary very much in the inner heliosphere.}

Numerical solutions of the full dispersion equation for propagation parallel or antiparallel to B are presented, and the linear properties of the whistler heat flux and electron beam firehose instabilities are exhibited and compared. Under a broad range of parameters the former mode has the lower beam speed threshold, and the larger maximum growth rate. In addition, it is demonstrated that, for a sufficiently large relative beam density, relative beam temperature, and plasma beta the whistler heat flux instability has a much lower beam speed threshold than the electrostatic electron beam instability. The application of these instabilities to first-order Fermi acceleration of electrons at space plasma shocks is discussed.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Finite heat flux often exists in space and astrophysical plasmas, which can be a free energy source for heat flux instability. The solar wind is a well-known example of such plasmas and a number of previous studies have investigated the characteristics of heat flux instability in the context of solar wind. In the literature there exists some uncertainties regarding the properties of heat flux instability. While some linear theories predict the association of the heat flux instability with right-hand polarized whistler waves, other studies argue for left-hand polarized unstable modes. The present study investigates the nonlinear development of initially unstable left-hand heat flux mode by means of particle-in-cell simulation. It is found that while the early phase is characterized by the left-hand polarization, in agreement with linear theory, as the wave amplitude becomes high and the instability enters the nonlinear phase, the dominant wave mode gradually switches over to the right-hand polarized waves. Such a behavior is related to the pitch angle scattering of the heat flux carrying electrons by nonlinear interaction with large-amplitude waves. The present study shows that the heat flux instability generally requires nonlinear treatment such that characterizing its behavior with linear theories may not always be adequate.}

After separating (beaming) strahl electrons from (isotropic) halo electrons according to their different behaviors in the angular distribution, we fit the observed energy spectrum of both strahl and halo electrons at ∼0.1–1.5 keV to a Kappa distribution function with an index κ and effective temperature Teff. We also calculate the number density n and average energy Eavg of strahl and halo electrons by integrating the electron measurements between ∼0.1 and 1.5 keV. We find a strong positive correlation between κ and Teff for both strahl and halo electrons, and a strong positive correlation between the strahl n and halo n, likely reflecting the nature of the generation of these suprathermal electrons. In both solar cycles, κ is larger at solar minimum than at solar maximum for both strahl and halo electrons. The halo κ is generally smaller than the strahl κ (except during the solar minimum of cycle 23). The strahl n is larger at solar maximum, but the halo n shows no difference between solar minimum and maximum. Both the strahl n and halo n have no clear association with the solar wind core population, but the density ratio between the strahl and halo roughly anti-correlates (correlates) with the solar wind density (velocity).}

We present a statistical analysis of magnetic field fluctuations in the whistler frequency range (above 16 Hz) based on about 801,500 magnetic field spectra measured over 3 yr aboard the Artemis spacecraft in the pristine solar wind. About 13,700 spectra (30 hr in total) with intense magnetic field fluctuations satisfy the interpretation in terms of quasi-parallel whistler waves. We provide estimates of the whistler wave occurrence probability, amplitudes, frequencies, and bandwidths. The occurrence probability of whistler waves is shown to strongly depend on the electron temperature anisotropy. The whistler wave amplitudes are in the range from about 0.01 to 0.1 nT and typically below 0.02 of the background magnetic field. The frequencies of the whistler waves are shown to be below an upper bound that is dependent on βe. The correlations established between the whistler wave properties and local macroscopic plasma parameters suggest that the observed whistler waves can be generated in local plasmas by the whistler heat flux instability. The whistler wave amplitudes are typically small, which questions the hypothesis that quasi-parallel whistler waves are capable to regulate the electron heat flux in the solar wind. We show that the observed whistler waves have sufficiently wide bandwidths and small amplitudes, so that effects of the whistler waves on electrons can be addressed in the frame of the quasi-linear theory.}
