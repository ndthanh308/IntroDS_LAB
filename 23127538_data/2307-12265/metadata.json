  "abstract": "Modal logics are widely used in multi-agent systems to reason about actions, abilities, norms, or epistemic states. Combined with description logic languages, they are also a powerful tool to formalise modal aspects of ontology-based reasoning over an object domain. However, the standard relational semantics for modalities is known to validate principles deemed problematic in agency, deontic, or epistemic applications. To overcome these difficulties, weaker systems of so-called non-normal modal logics, equipped with neighbourhood semantics that generalise the relational one, have been investigated both at the propositional and at the description logic level. We present here a family of non-normal modal description logics, obtained by extending ALC-based languages with non-normal modal operators. For formulas interpreted on neighbourhood models over varying domains, we provide a modular framework of terminating, correct, and complete tableau-based satisfiability checking algorithms in NExpTime. For a subset of these systems, we also consider a reduction to satisfiability on constant domain relational models. Moreover, we investigate the satisfiability problem in fragments obtained by disallowing the application of modal operators to description logic concepts, providing tight ExpTime complexity results.",
