\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose DFR-Net, a density-aware method for image dehazing that utilizes haze density differences to extract and refine density-related features. To achieve this, we generate a proposal image and explore density representation from it and the hazy input. We use two branches to extract and refine global and local density features, respectively, based on the density differences between the proposal image and the hazy input. In Global Branch, features of images with different densities are pushed away, while in Local Branch, hazy image features are gradually pulled closer to those of clear images. Our experimental results demonstrate that DFR-Net achieves high-performance image dehazing ability, and our ablation studies show that our designs enable fine awareness and refinement of density information.
