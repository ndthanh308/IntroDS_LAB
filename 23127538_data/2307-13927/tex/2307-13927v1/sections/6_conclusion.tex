\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduces various improvements for Swin Transformer applied to image dehazing, and the proposed DehazeFormer achieves superior performance on several datasets.
To summarize, we propose to use RescaleNorm and ReLU to replace the commonly used LayerNorm and GELU to avoid some negative effects that are not important for high-level vision tasks but critical for low-level vision tasks.
To improve the capability of MHSA, we propose a shifted window partitioning scheme based on reflection padding and a spatial information aggregation scheme using convolution in parallel with attention. 
We also propose some minor improvements that are applicable to other networks.
Finally, we collect a large-scale remote sensing image dehazing dataset to evaluate the network's capability to remove highly non-homogeneous haze, and DehazeFormer also achieves an impressive performance.
In the future, we plan to work on more lightweight and more straightforward architectures and extend the architecture to other low-level vision tasks. 
Besides, encoding feature maps on thumbnails and then decoding them on the original image may achieve real-time 4K image dehazing.
