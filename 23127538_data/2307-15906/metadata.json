  "abstract": "Since 2005, the global flagship of outreach activities in high-energy physics have been the International Particle Physics Masterclasses. We report on a survey performed among the participants from Slovakia and the Czech Republic, where we have studied the impact of Masterclasses on their further careers and their attitude towards science and especially particle physics. More than a half of our respondents does not work in science or research and development. However, most of them report positive shift in their attitude towards science. A positive nudge to physics career is indicated among those being open to such a possibility.",
