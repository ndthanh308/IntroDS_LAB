  "abstract": "We investigate the quench dynamics of interacting bosons on a two-leg ladder in presence of a uniform Abelian gauge field. The model hosts a variety of emergent quantum phases, and we focus on the superfluid biased-ladder phase breaking the $Z_{2}$ symmetry of two legs. We observe an asymmetric spreading of vortex current and particle density, i.e., the current behaves particle-like on the right and wave-like on the left, indicating spontaneous breaking of the spatial inversion symmetry. By decreasing the repulsion strength, it is found the particle-like current is more robust than the wave-like one. The evolution of entanglement entropy manifests logarithmic growth with time suggesting many-body localization matters.",
