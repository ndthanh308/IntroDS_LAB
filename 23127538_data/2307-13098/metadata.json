  "abstract": "Data centers are nowadays referred to as the digital world's cornerstone. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a method that solves the problem of distributing cryptographic keys between two entities, with the security rooted in the laws of quantum physics. This document provides an assessment of the need and opportunity for ushering QKD in data centers. Together with technical examples and inputs on how QKD has and could be integrated into data-center like environments, the document also discusses the creation of value through future-proof data security as well as the market potential that QKD brings on the table through e.g., crypto-agility. While primarily addressed to data center owners/operators, the document also offers a knowledge base to QKD vendors planning to diversify to the data center market segment.",
