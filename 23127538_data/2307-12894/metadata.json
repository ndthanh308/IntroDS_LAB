  "abstract": "Positronium (Ps) has emerged as a promising test particle within the QUPLAS collaboration for investigating the gravitational effect. In this work, we present a novel approach to generate a monoenergetic and highly coherent Ps beam by creating a negative Ps ion (Ps$^-$, consisting of two electrons and one positron). The necessary positron beam is formed by using a high flux electron LINAC. Subsequently, we utilize a Fabry-Perot IR laser cavity operating at a wavelength of 1560 nm to selectively remove the extra electron. An alternative pulsed laser operating at a 3600 nm wavelength was studied to reduce broadening due to recoil and excitation. Here, we provide a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the characteristics of the Ps beam, including its energy distribution and intensity profiles. The results obtained from this study will provide essential groundwork for future advancements in fundamental studies as Ps gravity measurements by using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.",
