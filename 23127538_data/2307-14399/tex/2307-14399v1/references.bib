A flux enhancement in the 4- to 5-micrometer wavelength window is a universal feature from jovian planets to brown dwarfs. Model results confirm the existence of methane and water in the spectrum of Gliese 229 B and indicate that its mass is 30 to 55 jovian masses. Although these calculations focus on Gliese 229 B, they are also meant to guide future searches for extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs.},

@article{mckay1989,
abstract = {We have developed a radiative-convective model of the thermal structure of Titan's atmosphere. The model computes the solar and infrared radiation in a series of spectral intervals with vertical resolution. Sources of opacity in the visible and near infrared include stratospheric haze particles, methane cloud particles, and gaseous methane; sources of opacity in the thermal infrared include the pressure-induced opacity of N2, CH4, and H2, the permitted transitions of C2H2 and C2H6, and particulate opacity. The haze properties are determined with a simple microphysics model. The model contains a minimum of free parameters and we try to determine these by fits to independent data sets. We find that gas and haze opacity alone, with the temperatures fixed by Voyager observations, produces a model that is within a few percent of radiative convective balance everywhere in the atmosphere. In a self-consistent computation of temperatures, we find that our model calculation for the surface temperature is, in general, colder than the observed value by 5-10°K. The presence or absence of methane condensation clouds only slightly alters the results. Good agreement can be obtained by adjusting the parameters in the model. The model parameters in these optimized cases are typically within 15{\} of the baseline values and within the limits allowed by observations. We conclude that the most important factors controlling Titan's thermal structure are absorption of sunlight by the stratospheric haze and the pressure-induced gas opacity in the infrared. Within the uncertainties of the model, these effects can explain the observed temperature profile. Condensation clouds play a minor role, if any. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {We present a method to calculate vertical profiles of particle size distributions in condensation clouds of giant planets and brown dwarfs. The method assumes a balance between turbulent diffusion and sedimentation in horizontally uniform cloud decks. Calculations for the Jovian ammonia cloud are compared with results from previous methods. An adjustable parameter describing the efficiency of sedimentation allows the new model to span the range of predictions made by previous models. Calculations for the Jovian ammonia cloud are consistent with observations. Example calculations are provided for water, silicate, and iron clouds on brown dwarfs and on a cool extrasolar giant planet. We find that precipitating cloud decks naturally account for the characteristic trends seen in the spectra of L- and T-type ultracool dwarfs.},
