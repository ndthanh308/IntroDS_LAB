  "abstract": "It is shown that if a link in 3-space bounds a proper oriented surface (without closed component) in the upper half 4-space, then the link bounds a proper oriented ribbon surface in the upper half 4-space which is a renewal embedding of the original surface. In particular, every slice knot is a ribbon knot, answering an old question by R. H. Fox affirmatively.",
