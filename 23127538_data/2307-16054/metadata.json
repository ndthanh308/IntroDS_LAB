  "abstract": "We adopt a top-down approach to agency aimed at developing a minimalist, scalable and naturalized account of it. After providing a general definition, we explore some possible extensions and refinements, domain of applicability, as well as a comparison with other recent accounts of agency, and possible objections to our proposal. With respect to what we classify as strong (such as Tononi's) and weak (such as Rovelli's) characterizations, our notion of agency situates itself in a middle position - our intent being precisely that of spelling out the advantages of this median account within a variety of contexts, such as the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the debate on the nature of physical laws and Bayesianism.",
