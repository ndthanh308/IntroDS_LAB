  "abstract": "We consider a gas of N weakly interacting bosons in the ground state. Such gases exhibit Bose-Einstein condensation. The binding energy is defined as the energy it takes to remove one particle from the gas. In this article, we prove an asymptotic expansion for the binding energy, and compute the first orders explicitly for the homogeneous gas. Our result addresses in particular a conjecture by Nam [Lett. Math. Phys., 108(1):141--159, 2018], and provides an asymptotic expansion of the ionization energy of bosonic atoms.",
