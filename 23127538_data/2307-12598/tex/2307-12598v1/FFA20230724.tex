\begin{abstract}
We investigate the effects of $p$-wave interactions on Efimov trimers in systems comprising two identical heavy fermions and a light particle, with mass ratios larger than $13.6$. Our focus lies on the borromean regime where the ground-state trimer exists in the absence of dimers. Using pair-wise Lennard-Jones potentials and concentrating on the $L^{\pi} = 1^{-}$ symmetry, we explore the critical value of the interspecies $s$-wave scattering length $a_{c}$ at which the borromean state appears in several two-component particle systems. We study the universal properties of $a_{c}$ and the influence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions on its value. Our findings show that, in the absence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions, $a_{c}$ is universally determined by the van der Waals radius and mass ratio. However, when attractive interactions between the two fermions are introduced, the formation of the borromean state becomes favored over the absence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the $p$-wave Efimov effects persist even when the fermion-fermion interaction is taken to the $p$-wave unitary limit.

\section{Introduction}
Universality and scaling symmetry in few-body systems have garnered considerable attention\;\cite{hwhammer2006,RevModPhys.89.035006,efimov_phisics}. Among the various phenomena, the Efimov effects, initially predicted by Efimov in 1970 \;\cite{Efimov1970}, have attracted broad interest in studies in atomic and nuclear physics\;\cite{hwhammer2006,RevModPhys.89.035006,efimov_phisics}. The most striking manifestation of the Efimov effect is the possibility of infinite three-body bound states when the two-body $s$-wave scattering length $a$ tends to infinity. These three-body bound states, called Efimov states, are not relevant to the details of the interaction potentials and follow the discrete symmetry scaling law \;$E_n=\lambda^2E_{n+1}$, where $\lambda=e^{\pi/ s_0}$ is the scaling constant and $s_0$ is a universal parameter\;\cite{efimov_phisics,D'Incao2006mass}.

The Efimov effect has been extensively studied in bosonic systems both theoretically and experimentally over the past decades\;\cite{Zaccanti2009Cs,Huang2014Cs,Gross2010Li7,Kunitski2015He,Pires2014cslia-,Ulmanis_Kuhnle2016csli,Johansen2017csli}. In principle, the three-body parameter could be defined in terms of any observable related to Efimov physics. One of the definitions is the value of $a_{-}^{(1)}$ at which the first Efimov resonance appears in the three-body recombination\;\cite{hwhammer2006,efimov_phisics}. Experiments with
alkali atoms have observed a universal value for the first Efimov resonance $a_{\scriptscriptstyle-}^{\scriptscriptstyle(1)}$, which is universally determined by the van der Waals (vdW) length $r_{\text{vdW}}$: $a_{\scriptscriptstyle-}^{\scriptscriptstyle (1)} = -9.1(2) r_{\text{vdW,HL}}\;[r_{\text{vdW,HL}} = (2 \mu_{\scriptscriptstyle 2b} C_{6})^{1/4}/2]$\;\cite{Wild2012Rb85,Roy2013K39,chinchen} in the homonuclear systems. This universality arises from a universal effective barrier in the three-body potentials that prevents the three particles from simultaneously approaching each other\;\cite{Sorensen2012,jiawangPRL2012,Huang2014Li6,Naidon2014PRL,Naidon2014PRLA}. For systems composed of two identical fermions(F) and one distinguishable particle(A), in the zero-range limit and negligible $p$-wave fermion-fermion interaction, the Efimov effect is predicted to be present in a $p$-wave channel when the mass ratio exceeds a critical value of 13.601\;\cite{hwhammer2006,Helfrich_2011}. Below this critical mass ratio, such systems can still support universal Kartavtsev-Malykh trimers (KM trimers)\;\cite{KartavtsevAtomicNuclei}and crossover trimers\;\cite{PhysRevA.86.062703} in the limit of the infinite and finite positive $s$-wave scattering length, respectively. The spectrum of these trimers, as functions of $s$-wave scattering length and mass ratio, has been extensively studied, considering the three-body boundary condition set by a momentum cutoff. However, it has been found that the three-body boundary condition significantly affects the trimer spectrum in addition to the $s$-wave scattering length in the zero-range limit. In a physical system with finite-range interactions, the critical value of interspecies scattering length $a_{c}$ at which the first $p$-wave Efimov state occurs, as well as its potential van der Waals universality similar to the $s$-wave Efimov effects, remains largely unknown.

Interactions between two fermions are always present, which are described at low energy by two parameters: the $p$-wave scattering volume and the $p$-wave effective range. It is natural to question whether the $p$-wave fermion-fermion interaction has an impact on the universal properties of F-F-A system? Recent studies by Yu-Hsin and Chris\;\cite{PhysRevA.107.033329} explored the Efimov physics at $p$-wave unitarity for three equal-mass fermions in multiple symmetries and found that the $p$-wave unitarity interaction will not produce a true Efimov effect, but one or two $p$-wave unitary channels emerge at unitarity. More recently, Pascal's\;\cite{1021468SciPostPhys} study shows that there will exist $p$-wave induced borromean trimers in F-F-A system for any mass ratio in the presence of the $p$-wave interaction between the two fermions. This raises the question of whether the $p$-wave Efimov effects can still persist in F-F-A systems when fermion-fermion interaction is present, and what the effect of $p$-wave interaction is on the Efimov three-body parameters.

To address these questions, we consider a system consisting of two heavy identical fermions of mass $M$ and one light particle with mass $m$, interacting via Lennard-Jones potentials that effectively mimic the finite range and repulsive core of realistic interactions. Each fermion interacts with another particle in the vicinity of an $s$-wave resonance, while the two identical fermions interact in the $p$-wave channel. We investigate the critical value of the interspecies $s$-wave scattering length $a_{c}$ at which the borromean state with $L^{\pi}=1^{-}$ symmetry appears for seven experimentally interested systems with mass ratios $M/m$ ranging from 6 to 30. The universal properties of $a_{c}$ and the influence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions on its value are studied within the adiabatic hyperspherical representation.

This paper is organized as follows:
In Sec. II, we present our calculation method and all necessary formulas for calculations.
In Sec. III, we discuss the results and emphasize the significant role of $p$-wave interactions in F-F-A systems.
Finally, we conclude and summarize our work in Sec. IV.
Throughout the paper, atomic units are employed unless stated otherwise.
\section{Theoretical formalism}
%This numerical study focuses on the FFA system with total angular momentum and parity  $J^\Pi=1^-$.
We consider the general problem of two identical fermions of mass M and one particle of mass m, all three interacting with each other through finite-range interaction. The two fermions are denoted as particles 1 and 2, and the third particle as 3. The distance between particles $i$ and $j$ are labeled as $r_{ij}$.
In the frame of hyperspherical coordinates, the three-body Schr$ \ddot{o}$dinger equation describing the relative motion of system can be expressed in terms of $R$ that describe the global size and hyperangles $ \Omega$ which include two hyperangles $ \theta $ and $\phi$ that describe the shape of the three-body system, and the three usual Euler angles $ \alpha,\beta,\gamma $ that describe the rigid-body rotations. After rescaled   by $\psi_{\upsilon'}(R;\Omega)=\Psi_{\upsilon'}(R;\Omega)R^{5/2}\sin\phi\cos\phi$,  the three-body equation for the relative motion can be written as:
\begin{equation}
\label{1}
\bigg[-\frac{1}{2\mu}\frac{d^2}{dR^2}+\bigg(\frac{\Lambda^2-\frac{1}{4}}{2\mu R^2}
+V(R;\theta,\phi)\bigg)\bigg]\psi_{\upsilon'}(R;\Omega) =E\psi_{\upsilon'}(R;\Omega)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda^2$ is the squared "grand angular momentum operator", whose expression is given in Ref\;\cite{CDLIN1995}.
$\mu=\sqrt{\frac{m_1 m_2 m_3 }{m_1+m_2+m_3}}$ is three-body reduce mass, where $1$, $2$ and $3$ refer to the fermion, fermion and the other atom respectively.
The total potential $V(R;\theta,\phi)$ in Eq.(\ref{1}) is defined as the pairwise sum of the two-body interactions with
\begin{equation}
\label{2}
V(R;\theta,\phi) = \upsilon(r_{12})+\upsilon(r_{23})+\upsilon(r_{31})\,
\end{equation}
and without
\begin{equation}
\label{222}
V(R;\theta,\phi) = \upsilon(r_{23})+\upsilon(r_{31})\,
\end{equation}
fermion-fermion $p$-wave interaction respectively.

The adiabatic Hamiltonian, containing all angular dependence and interactions, is defined as
\begin{equation}
H_{ad}(R,\Omega)=\left[\frac{\Lambda^2-1/4}{2\mu R^2}+V(R,\theta,\phi)\right].
\end{equation}
The adiabatic potentionals $U_v(R)$ and the corresponding channel functions $\Phi_\nu(R,\Omega)$ at the fixed $R$ are obtained by solving the following equation:
\begin{align}
H_{ad}(R,\Omega)\Phi_\nu(R,\Omega)=U_\nu\Phi_\nu(R,\Omega),
\end{align}
whose solution depend parametrically on $R$. The set of $\Phi_\nu(R,\Omega)$  is orthogonal
\begin{align}
\int\Phi_\mu(R,\Omega)^*\Phi_\nu(R,\Omega)=\delta_{\mu\nu},
\end{align}
and complete
\begin{equation}
\sum_\nu\Phi_\nu(R,\Omega)^*\Phi_\nu(R,\Omega')=\delta(\Omega-\Omega'),
\end{equation}
at each given $R$.
The wave function $\psi_{\upsilon'}$ can then be expanded with the complete, orthonormal adiabatic channel functions $ \Phi_\nu$ as
\begin{align}
\label{8}
 \psi_{\upsilon'}(R;\Omega)=\sum^\infty_{\nu=0}F_{\nu \upsilon'}(R)\Phi_\nu(R;\Omega)\,,
\end{align}
substituting it into Eq.(\ref{1}), a set of coupled ordinary differential equations is obtained:
\begin{align}
\label{28}
[-\frac{1}{2\mu}\frac{d^2}{dR^2}+U_\nu(R)- E]F_{\nu,\upsilon'}(R)
-\frac{1}{2\mu}\sum_{\mu}[2P_{\mu\nu}(R)\frac{d}{dR}+Q_{\mu\nu}(R)]F_{\mu \upsilon'}(R)=0\,,
\end{align}
In the above expression, E is the total energy and $W_{v}$ is the effective adiabatic potential in channel $\nu$:
\begin{align}
W_{\nu}(R)\equiv U_{\nu}(R)-\frac{1}{2\nu} Q_{\nu\nu}(R)\,.
\end{align}
The nonadiabatic coupling matrices $P_{\mu\nu}(R)$ and $Q_{\mu\nu}(R)$ are defined as
\begin{align}
\label{29}
P_{\mu\nu}(R)=\int d\Omega \Phi_{\mu}(R;\Omega)^{*}\frac{\partial}{\partial R}\Phi_{\nu}(R;\Omega)\,,
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\label{30}
Q_{\mu\nu}(R) = \int d\Omega \Phi_{\mu}(R;\Omega)^{*}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial R^{2}}\Phi_{\nu}(R;\Omega)\,.
\end{align}
The hyper-radial equation is solved by the slow variable discretization (SVD) method\;\cite{Tolstikhin_1996} combined with the finite-element method. The details can be find in the Ref.\;\cite{Wumengshan2016}.


\section{Results and discussion}
\subsection{two-body system}
To model the interactions between two atoms, we use the Lennard-Jones potential,
 \begin{equation}
\label{39}
\upsilon(r_{ij})= -\frac{C_{6,ij}}{r^6_{ij}}\bigg[1-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\gamma_{ij}}{r_{ij}})^6\bigg]\,,
\end{equation}
which has been widely used in the literature and is an excellent model potential for exploring van der Waals universality in Efimov physics\;\cite{yujunwangPRl2012,Ulmanis2016cslia+,PhysRevA.86.062511,jiawangPRL2012, PhysRevA.90.022106}. The Lennard-Jones potential has the van der Waals length and can avoid numerical difficulties in the short range.\;\cite{jiawangPRL2012}.
 The parameter $\gamma_{ij}$ in this model potential can be adjusted to give the desired scattering length and number of bound states.
The values of $C_6$ between two atoms adopted here are listed in Table \ref{t1}.
By adjusting the parameter $\gamma_{FF}$, we can study the influence of identical fermion interaction near or away from the $p$-wave resonance.

For low-energy $p$-wave scattering of a short-range potential, the variation of the phase shift $\delta_1(k)$ with energy $E=k^2/(2\mu)$ can be expressed in terms of only two parameters $V_p$ and $r_p$
 \begin{equation}
\label{399}
k^3 \delta_1(k)\rightarrow -\frac{1}{V_p}+\frac{1}{2}r_pk^2+\textsl{O}(k^4)\,,
\end{equation}
where $\delta_1$ is the $p$-wave phase shift, $V_p$ is the $p$-wave scattering volume, and $r_p$ is the $p$-wave effective range\;\cite{doi:10.1119/1.1473644}. The units of the $p$-wave scattering volume and effective range
are (length)$^3$ and 1/(length), respectively.

% The necessary mass ratios for the $p$-wave Efimov effects could be realized for heteronuclear mixtures with $6^$LiC$87^$Sr, $6/7^$LiC$137^$Ba, $6/7$LiC$167$Er, or $6/7$LiC$171/173$Yb. The $^{40}$K-$^{6}$Li and $7^$LiC$87$Sr mixtures will not show Efimov effects when neglect $p$-wave fermion-fermion interaction. They are suitable examples to study the effects of $p$-wave ferimon-ferimon interaction on the Borremon region. The mass, van der Waals dispersion coefficients for these systems are shown in the table\ref{t1}




%As the mass ratio between the particles is varied, we find various scattering resonances that can be attributed to the appearance of universal trimers and Efimov trimers at the collisions threshold.

\subsection{Without Fermion-Fermion interaction}
In this section, we focus on the regime where the interaction between the fermions can be neglected. In this situation, the Efimov effect only comes into play for a mass ratio $M/m \geq 13.6$.
To investigate the universality of the critical value of the F-A $s$-wave scattering length $a_{c}$ for the appearance of the borromean state with symmetry $L^{\pi} = 1^{-}$, we plot the the lowest adiabatic potentials $W(R)$ for $^{87}$Sr\,-$^{87}$Sr\,-$^{6}$Li at $a_{SrLi}\rightarrow\infty$. These potentials were obtained at different $s$-wave poles of Sr-Li potential, as shown in Figure\;\ref{fig1}. The effective adiabatic potentials $W(R)$ obtained for varying numbers of $^{87}$Sr-$^{6}$Li two-body bound states converge to a single universal curve, displaying three-body parameter universality, similar to the $s$-wave Efimov effects case. Moreover, these effective potentials exhibit the usual Efimov behavior for $R>10\, r_{\text{vdw,SrLi}}$ with $s_{0}=0.399$. Additionally, they show a repulsive wall at about $R= 3 r_{\text{vdw,SrLi}}$ after scaling by $r_{\text{vdw,SrLi}}$, independent of the number of two-body bound states.

To further investigate the universality of the critical value $a_{c}$, we perform calculations for various mass ratios and determine the values of $a_{c}$ required to observe the borromean state with $L^\pi=1^{-}$ symmetry without $p$-wave fermion-fermion interaction. As expected, we have not found a three-body borromean state in the $^{87}$Sr\,-$^{87}$Sr\,-$^{7}$Li and $^{40}$K\,-$^{40}$K\,-$^{6}$Li systems, whose mass ratios are less than the critical value of $13.6$. For the other five F-F-A systems, we present the critical scattering length values as a function of mass ratios in Fig.\;\ref{fig2}. As the mass ratio $M/m$ increases, the absolute value of $a_{c}$ tends to become smaller. The $^{167}$Er\,-$^{167}$Er\,-$^{6}$Li and $^{171}$Yb\,-$^{171}$Yb\,-$^{6}$Li systems, which have similar mass ratios and $r_{\text{vdw,FA}}$ values, are found to have the same critical scattering length.
Figure \ref{fig3} shows the effective potential curves for these systems with $a_{FA}$ fixed at the critical value $a_{c}$. It is shown that the effective potential well tends to become deeper as the mass ratio decreases.
This is a manifestation of the fact that a more attractive interaction is needed to form a trimer as the mass ratio approaches the critical mass ratio of $13.6$ at which Efimov effects appear.

\subsection{With Fermion-Fermion interaction}
In this section, we consider the model case where the $p$-wave interaction exists between two fermions. We aim to study the influence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions on the critical scattering length value $a_{c}$ where the $p$-wave borromean state appears. The $p$-wave attraction between the two fermions is described by the L-J model potential. Similar to the study of F-A interaction, we have adjusted the parameter $\gamma$ to produce the desired scattering volumes $v_p$. For the $^{87}$Sr\,-$^{87}$Sr\,-$^{7}$Li and $^{40}$K\,-$^{40}$K\,-$^{6}$Li systems without fermion-fermion interaction, there isn't any $p$-wave bound state on the negative scattering length side even when the scattering length $a_{\scriptscriptstyle\textsl{FA}}$ is tuned to negative infinite limit. Figure\;\ref{fig4} compares the effective adiabatic potential curves of the $^{87}$Sr\,-$^{87}$Sr\,-$^{7}$Li system for the $L^{\pi} = 1^{-}$ symmetry with and without the fermion-fermion $p$-wave interaction. The $^{87}$Sr and $^{7}$Li atoms' interaction is fixed at $a_{\scriptscriptstyle\textsl{FA}}\rightarrow\infty$. The solid curves represent the potential curves neglecting the $^{87}$Sr\,-$^{87}$Sr $p$-wave interaction, while the dashed lines are the ones with $^{87}$Sr\,-$^{87}$Sr interaction fixed at $v_p =-1.5\, r_{\text{vdw,SrSr}}^{3}$. As can be seen, the effective potential well significantly deepens even with weak fermion-fermion interaction.

Now consider the situation where the F-A interaction fixed at the $s$-wave unitary. As the fermion-fermion $p$-wave scattering volume $V_{p}$ is varied, our calculations show that the $p$-wave borromean state will be created at $v_p =-1.13\, r_{\text{vdw,SrSr}}^{3}$ for $^{87}$Sr\,-$^{87}$Sr\,-$^{7}$Li system. For the $^{40}$K\,-$^{40}$K\,-$^{6}$Li system, the $p$-wave borromean bound state occurs at $v_p =-2.6\, r_{\text{vdw,KK}}^{3}$. Figure \ref{fig4} indicates that this type of borromean state arises due to attractive interactions between two fermions and may be model-dependent for such small scattering volumes. We plot the adiabatic potentials $W(R)$ for $^{87}$Sr\,-$^{87}$Sr\,-$^{7}$Li with various $p$-wave poles of the $^{87}$Sr-$^{87}$Sr interaction to investigate further. Figure \ref{fig5} shows the results, where the $^{87}$Sr\,-$^{7}$Li interaction is set at the $s$-wave unitary limit, and the fermion-fermion interaction is $v_p =-1.5\, r_{\text{vdw,SrSr}}^{3}$ at different $p$-wave poles. The effective adiabatic potentials obtained for different numbers of $^{87}$Sr-$^{87}$Sr two-body $p$-wave bound states do not converge to a single universal curve, indicating that the trimer state depends on the details of the $^{87}$Sr-$^{87}$Sr short-range interaction.

Then we explore how the strength of $p$-wave interaction affects the position of the borromean trimer. By fixing the $p$-wave scattering volumes at specific values, we determine the critical scattering length $a_{c}$ of fermion-atom required for the appearance of the borromean state. Figure \;\ref{fig6} displays the results of our calculations. It is evident that stronger fermion-fermion interactions favor the formation of the borromean state, leading to smaller absolute values of $a_{c}$. Notably, this trend is observed in small mass ratio systems such as $^{40}$K-$^{40}$K-$^{6}$Li and $^{87}$Sr-$^{87}$Sr-$^{7}$Li, where $a_{c}$ is strongly dependent on the $p$-wave scattering volume $V_{\scriptscriptstyle{P}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{1/3}}$. In contrast, for large mass ratio systems like $^{171}$Yb-$^{171}$Yb-$^{6}$Li and $^{167}$Er-$^{167}$Er-$^{6}$Li, the $p$-wave interaction plays a less significant role in determining $a_{c}$. This observation aligns with the insensitivity of the Efimov scaling factor to heavy-heavy interactions in systems consisting of two heavy identical bosons and a light atom\;\cite{hwhammer2006}.

To further explore the impact of $p$-wave interactions in F-F-A systems, we focus on the case where the interaction between the two fermions is taken to the $p$-wave unitary limit for the $L^{\pi}=1^{-}$ symmetry. We initially examine the $^{87}$Sr-$^{87}$Sr-$^{7}$Li system, which does not support Efimov states in the absence of $p$-wave interaction between $^{87}$Sr atoms. Figure\;\ref{fig7}(a) presents the adiabatic potential curves $2\mu R^2 W(R)$ for this system with different strength of $p$-wave unitary interaction. Figure\;\ref{fig7}(b) includes the curves for a finite $^{87}$Sr-$^{87}$Sr $p$-wave interaction with $V_{\scriptscriptstyle{P}} = -1.5 r_{\text{vdw,SrSr}}^{3}$. The interaction between $^{87}$Sr and $^{7}$Li is fixed at the $s$-wave unitary limit, and the two $^{87}$Sr atoms interact at the first $p$-wave pole. It is evident that the $p$-wave unitary interaction gives rise to additional potential curves that do not exist in the purely $s$-wave case or in the case with finite $^{87}$Sr-$^{87}$Sr $p$-wave interaction. This phenomenon has been observed in two-component fermions of the same mass\;\cite{PhysRevA.105.013308}.  Notably, the lowest adiabatic potential curve's asymptotic behavior remains unchanged as the $p$-wave interaction is tuned to infinity, while the potential well becomes significantly stronger. The coefficient of $1/(2\mu R^2)$ in the lowest adiabatic potential curve approaches 0 at long range.

Figure\;\ref{fig8} displays the $2\mu R^2 W(R)$ and $W(R)$ curves for the $^{171}$Yb-$^{171}$Yb-$^{6}$Li system in $L^{\pi}=1^{-}$ symmetry, including the Efimov curve for comparison. The lowest potential curve (solid line) supports $p$-wave Efimov states when the heavy-light atom interaction approaches the $s$-wave unitary limit in the absence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interaction. This curve approaches the universal Efimov constant: -($s_{0}^2 + 1/4$) with $s_{0} = 1.628$ throughout the range from $R = 100\, r_{\text{vdw,YbYb}}$ to at least $R=300\, r_{\text{vdw,YbYb}}$ as shown in Fig.\;\ref{fig8}(a). The system exhibits additional potential curves arising from the fermion-fermion $p$-wave unitary interaction, similar to the non-Efimovian $^{87}$Sr-$^{87}$Sr-$^{7}$Li system. An interesting finding is that the extent to which the lowest adiabatic potential curve approaches the Efimov curve can be modified by the presence of fermion-fermion $p$-wave interaction, depending on its strength. Figure\;\ref{fig8}(b) illustrates the differences in the lowest adiabatic potentials for varying strengths of $p$-wave interaction, clearly showing more pronounced deviations in the potential well region with the addition of $p$-wave interaction. This means that the fermion-fermion $p$-wave interaction will affect the critical scattering length at which the $p$-wave borromean state occurs. To further explore the effects of this interaction, we present the critical scattering values with resonant fermion-fermion $p$-wave interaction in Figure\;\ref{fig9}. These values fall within the range of $\left[-3.30\, r_{\text{vdW,FF}}, -2.24\, r_{\text{vdW,FF}}\right]$ after being scaled by the characteristic length scale $r_{\text{vdw,FF}}$.

\section{Conclusions}
To summarize, we examined the impact of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions on Efimov physics in three-particle systems comprised of two heavy fermions with identical masses $M$ and a lighter particle with mass $m$, where the mass ratios were greater than 13.6.
Our analysis employed a single-channel Lennard-Jones interaction featuring long-range two-body van der Waals potentials. We focused primarily on the borromean regime, where the ground-state trimer with $L^{\pi}=1^{-}$ symmetry exists in the absence of dimers. The critical value of the interspecies $s$-wave scattering length $a_{c}$ at which the borromean state appears for several two-component particle systems is studied. We find that with negligible $p$-wave fermion-fermion interaction, $a_{c}$ is universally determined by the van der Waals radius and mass ratio $M/m$. Evidence for the universality of the critical value has emerged from our tests of different $s$-wave poles of two-body Lennard-Jones potentials. Our calculations demonstrated the influence of $p$-wave fermion-fermion interactions on the value of the critical interspecifies scattering length. The formation of the borromean state is promoted in the presence of attractive interactions between the two fermions. We also demonstrated that $p$-wave Efimov effects persist even at the $p$-wave unitary limit of the fermion-fermion interaction.
