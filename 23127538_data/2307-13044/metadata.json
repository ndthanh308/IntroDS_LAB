  "abstract": "We propose an interpretation for the meets and joins in the lattice of experimental propositions of a physical theory, answering a question of Birkhoff and von Neumann in [1]. When the lattice is atomistic, it is isomorphic to the lattice of definably closed sets of a finitary relational structure in First Order Logic. In terms of mapping experimental propositions to subsets of the atomic phase space, the meet corresponds to set intersection, while the join is the definable closure of set union. The relational structure is defined by the action of the lattice automorphism group on the atomic layer. Examining this correspondence between physical theories and infinite group actions, we show that the automorphism group must belong to a family of permutation groups known as geometric Jordan groups. We then use the classification theorem for Jordan groups to argue that the combined requirements of probability and atomicism leave uncountably infinite Steiner 2-systems (of which projective spaces are standard examples) as the sole class of options for generating the lattice of particle Quantum Mechanics.",
