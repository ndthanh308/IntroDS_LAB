\section*{Limitations}\label{sec:limitations}
In this study, we have investigated the effectiveness of \model as a simple yet effective mechanism for improving recommendation through large language models. While effective, \model does have its limitations. First, there is extra computational cost associated with \model framework. The primary computational load comes from the augmentation phase including the augmented output text length. Our findings indicate that selecting important words for inclusion, rather than incorporating all response words, can lead to improved recommendation performance, as evidenced in Table~\ref{tab:mask_keyword}. Our future work will explore the balance between the number of words generated and the resulting performance enhancements. Second, similar to many LLM-based studies, \model faces challenges in promptly incorporating the latest knowledge. We plan to investigate methods in future work for LLMs to autonomously gather and summarize current knowledge from external sources, thereby improving text augmentation effectiveness.
