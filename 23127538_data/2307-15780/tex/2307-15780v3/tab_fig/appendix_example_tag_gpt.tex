        \textbf{Description}: This unique Tex-Mex recipe was created by a distant relative who was stationed at the Alamo almost 160 years ago. Family stories say that he was searching for quality tomatoes when Santa Ana launched an attack on the now-iconic Texas landmark. Fortunately, our ancestor had hidden this recipe in his coon-skin cap's lining, ensuring that both he and his avocado dip survived to see another day. Years later, as he lay dying from a chihuahua bite infection, he gazed deeply into his son's eyes and, with his final breath, whispered the memorable words, ``Remember... the... guacamole.''
