  "abstract": "We give criteria for a graph of groups to have finite stature with respect to its collection of vertex groups, in the sense of Huang-Wise. We apply it to the triangle Artin groups that were previously shown to split as a graph of groups. This allows us to deduce residual finiteness, and expands the list of Artin groups known to be residually finite.",
