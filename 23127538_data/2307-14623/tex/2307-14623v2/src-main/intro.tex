\section{Introduction}
Phase-change phenomena, such as boiling, involve complex multiphysics processes and dynamics that are not fully understood. The interplay between bubble dynamics and heat transfer performance during boiling presents significant challenges in accurately predicting and modeling these heat and mass transfer processes. Machine learning (ML) offers the potential to revolutionize this field, enabling data-driven discovery to unravel new physical insights, develop accurate surrogate and predictive models, optimize the design of heat transfer systems, and facilitate adaptive real-time monitoring and control. %\fix{new better citations}

The applications of ML in this domain are diverse and impactful. Consider the context of high-performance computing in data centers, where efficient cooling is critical. Boiling-based cooling techniques, such as two-phase liquid cooling, offer enhanced heat dissipation capabilities, ensuring reliable and optimal operation of power-intensive electronic components such as GPUs. Moreover, boiling phenomena play a crucial role in complex processes like nuclear fuel reprocessing, where precise modeling and prediction of boiling dynamics contribute to the safe and efficient management of nuclear waste. In the realm of water desalination, boiling processes are integral, playing a vital role in thermal desalination methods that provide clean drinking water in water-scarce regions . These advancements in pivotal areas such as thermal management, energy efficiency, and heat transfer applications, driven by ML techniques have far-reaching implications, empowering us to design more sustainable energy systems, enhance environmental preservation efforts, and advance engineering capabilities across various domains. %\fix{new better citations}

To train data-driven ML algorithms effectively, we need large, diverse, and accurately labeled datasets. However, obtaining high-fidelity datasets that encompass a wide range of phase-change phenomena and operating conditions is a significant challenge. Boiling processes are highly sensitive to factors like surface properties, pressure, orientation, and working fluid composition \cite{attinger2014surface}. Additionally, the chaotic nature of vapor interactions and occlusions makes quantifying boiling processes inherently difficult. Specialized experimental setups, involving instrumentation, sensors, and high-speed visualization techniques, come with substantial costs, further limiting the availability of extensive and accurate large-scale experimental data \cite{suh2021deep}. As a result, only a few well-funded research laboratories have access to precise ground truth data, and even then, this data often lacks fidelity and fails to capture detailed microscale dynamics, such as local bubble-induced turbulence and its impact on overall heat transfer. This scarcity of high-fidelity datasets poses challenges in designing accurate ML models for multiphase and phase change processes. While scientific ML (SciML) approaches can incorporate physical knowledge and constraints into the training process to reduce some of this data burden \cite{raissi2020hidden}, the validation and quantification of uncertainty still rely on the availability of ground truth data. Therefore, there is an urgent need for open, diverse, and large-scale datasets to develop robust models and advance research in multiphysics problems such as phase change phenomena.

Simulations have played a key role as the third pillar of science in overcoming the inherent challenges faced by experimental studies in various scientific domains. High-fidelity multiscale data from simulations complement and enhance experimental measurements. In the field of phase change, simulations have successfully modeled transport equations for momentum, energy, and phase transition enabling accurate measurements of velocity, pressure, and temperature fields around bubbles \cite{SATO2018876, kunkelmann2009cfd}. As a result, simulations serve as powerful tools for understanding and quantifying boiling. However, SciML researchers often setup their own simulations to generate ground truth solutions for training and testing their models, rather than relying on shared benchmark datasets. This is even common among major papers: \cite{raissi2020hidden, li2021fourier, lulu2021, kovachki2023neural}. While this approach is reasonable for studying specific, simple partial differential equations (PDEs), real-world applications of PDE solvers and simulations often involve large-scale systems with complex multiphase physics and a combination of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions \cite{StraussPDE}. These real-world problems require substantial domain expertise, engineering time, and computational resources. Performing such simulations independently is impractical or even infeasible for many ML researchers. This difficulty in dataset generation has led to a drought of SciML research to study ``real-world" physics problems.  Previous efforts to build benchmark datasets have primarily focused on single- and multiphysics problems with single-phase dynamics \cite{PDEBench2022, simphys2021, chung2022blastnet, bonnet2022airfrans}.

As a response to the aforementioned challenges, we introduce the BubbleML Dataset \footnote{Through Zenodo, a permanent DOI for the dataset \href{https://zenodo.org/record/8039786}{10.5281/zenodo.8039786}}, an extensive and innovative collection of data generated through Flash-X simulations \cite{DUBEY2022}. This dataset encompasses a wide range of boiling phenomena, including nucleate boiling of single bubbles, merging bubbles, flow boiling in different configurations, and subcooled boiling. Figure \ref{fig:dataset-variables} provides a visual glimpse into the diverse range of physical phenomena and variables covered by the dataset. To further enhance its applicability, the dataset covers various gravity conditions ranging from earth gravity to gravity at the International Space Station, different heater temperatures and also different inlet velocities. In total, we present around \update{80} simulations, each capturing a specific combination of parameters and conditions. In summary, the key contributions are as follows:

\textbf{Multiphase and Multiphysics Dataset.} A comprehensive dataset encompassing a wide range of two-phase (liquid-vapor) phase change phenomena in boiling, with a focus on bubble and flow dynamics. This dataset will will be of great interest to the scientific machine learning and thermal science communities.

\textbf{Real-world Validation.} Validation against experimental data to ensure the datasets accuracy and reliability. This validation process enhances the dataset's fidelity and establishes a strong connection between simulation and real-world phenomena.

\textbf{Diverse Downstream Tasks.} BubbleML is designed to facilitate diverse downstream tasks. To demonstrate the dataset's potential, we provide two benchmark scenarios: optical flow for learning bubble dynamics and scientific machine learning using operator networks to learn temperature dynamics and estimate heatflux.
