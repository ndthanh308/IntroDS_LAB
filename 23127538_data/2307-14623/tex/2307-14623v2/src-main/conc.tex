\section{Conclusions and Limitations}
This paper presents the BubbleML dataset, which fills a critical gap in ML research for multiphase multiphysics systems. By employing physics-driven simulations, the dataset offers precise ground truth information for a variety of boiling scenarios, encompassing a wide range of parameters and providing a comprehensive and diverse collection of data. BubbleML is validated against experimental observations and trends, establishing its reliability and relevance in multiphysics phase change research. The two BubbleML benchmarks demonstrate applications in improving the accuracy of optical flow estimation and SciML modeling encountered in multiphase systems. \update{Importantly, BubbleML extends its impact beyond its immediate applications. It resonates with broader challenges in SciML, serving as a foundational platform to study several open problems.}  

\paragraph{Limitations.} \update{Combining datasets might pose challenges due to their varying sizes. Because the resolution scales proportionally with the domain size, the constant relative spacing between grid cells allows the UNet model to be effectively trained on the merged boiling dataset. However, this approach does not extend to FNO, requiring domain decomposition methods \cite{wang2022mosaic} or downscaling strategies \cite{ren2023superbench} to accommodate variable domain sizes. 
Note that the dataset is also exclusively composed of simulations due to the unavailability of experimental data with velocity, pressure, and temperature fields. Future work will involve collaboration with experimentalists to augment the dataset.
