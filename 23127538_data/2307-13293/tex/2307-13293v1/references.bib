abstract = {With its unprecedented light-collecting area for night-sky observations, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) holds great potential for also optical stellar astronomy, in particular as a multi-element intensity interferometer for realizing imaging with sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution. Such an order-of-magnitude increase of the spatial resolution achieved in optical astronomy will reveal the surfaces of rotationally flattened stars with structures in their circumstellar disks and winds, or the gas flows between close binaries. Image reconstruction is feasible from the second-order coherence of light, measured as the temporal correlations of arrival times between photons recorded in different telescopes. This technique (once pioneered by Hanbury Brown and Twiss) connects telescopes only with electronic signals and is practically insensitive to atmospheric turbulence and to imperfections in telescope optics. Detector and telescope requirements are very similar to those for imaging air Cherenkov observatories, the main difference being the signal processing (calculating cross correlations between single camera pixels in pairs of telescopes). Observations of brighter stars are not limited by sky brightness, permitting efficient CTA use during also bright-Moon periods. While other concepts have been proposed to realize kilometer-scale optical interferometers of conventional amplitude (phase-) type, both in space and on the ground, their complexity places them much further into the future than CTA, which thus could become the first kilometer-scale optical imager in astronomy.}

abstract = {GRB 221009A is the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever detected. To probe the very-high-energy (VHE; &gt;100 GeV) emission, the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) began observations 53 hr after the triggering event, when the brightness of the moonlight no longer precluded observations. We derive differential and integral upper limits using H.E.S.S. data from the third, fourth, and ninth nights after the initial GRB detection, after applying atmospheric corrections. The combined observations yield an integral energy flux upper limit of  above E thr = 650 GeV. The constraints derived from the H.E.S.S. observations complement the available multiwavelength data. The radio to X-ray data are consistent with synchrotron emission from a single electron population, with the peak in the spectral energy distribution occurring above the X-ray band. Compared to the VHE-bright GRB 190829A, the upper limits for GRB 221009A imply a smaller gamma-ray to X-ray flux ratio in the afterglow. Even in the absence of a detection, the H.E.S.S. upper limits thus contribute to the multiwavelength picture of GRB 221009A, effectively ruling out an IC-dominated scenario.}

abstract = {Along with the generalization and scale deployment of commercial satellite constellations lead by SpaceX Starlink, light pollution caused by satellites has had a serious impact on astronomical observations. In order to provide a friendly tool for simulating and studying the impact of mega-constellation satellites on astronomical observation, two plugin modules for the WorldWide Telescope were designed. The satellite visibility simulation module “Sats Tracker” shows whether and when satellites appear in a specific sky area. The telescope observation module “Obs Simulator” loads and simulates observation plans for telescopes. Combining the two modules, we are able to simulate and assess the influence of constellation satellites on a specific observatory at a given time. As an example application of the new tools, we simulated and analyzed the adverse effects of Starlink satellites on observation at the Xinjiang Altay Observatory, including impacts in general for the observatory site and detailed analysis for specific observation plans. In the simulation, the search for electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave events was used as an example of a research topic easily influenced by Starlink and other constellations. The software presented in this paper can be used as an auxiliary tool for observation planning to mitigate the impact of satellite constellations. It also provides an easy-to-use simulation toolkit for the public to understand Starlink and raise their awareness of Dark and Quiet Sky protection.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
abstract = {We investigate a novel satellite avoidance strategy to mitigate the impact of large commercial satellite constellations in low-Earth orbit on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We simulate the orbits of currently planned Starlink and OneWeb constellations (∼40,000 satellites) to test how effectively an upgraded Rubin scheduler algorithm can avoid them, and assess how the overall survey is affected. Given a reasonably accurate satellite orbit forecast, we find it is possible to adjust the scheduler algorithm to effectively avoid some satellites. Overall, sacrificing 10\% of LSST observing time to avoid satellites reduces the fraction of LSST visits with streaks by a factor of 2. Whether such a mitigation will be required depends on the overall impact of streaks on science, which is not yet well quantified. This is due to a lack of adequate information about satellite brightness distributions as well as the impact of glints and low surface brightness residuals on alert purity and systematic errors in cosmological parameter estimation. A significant increase in the number of satellites or their brightness during Rubin Operations may make implementing this satellite avoidance strategy worthwhile.}
