  "abstract": "We analytically calculate the contribution to the local density of states due to thermal sources in a disk-like patch within the framework of fluctuational electrodynamics. We further introduce a wavevector cutoff method to approximate this contribution. We compare the results obtained with the source and cutoff method with the numerical exact LDOS above a metal disk attained by SCUFF-EM calculations. By this comparison we highlight the difference and resemblance of thermal and geometrical boundary conditions which are both relevant for near-field scanning microscope measurements. Finally, we give an outlook to general lateral temperature profiles and compare it with surface profiles.",
