\begin{abstract}
    We investigate practical algorithms to find or disprove the existence of small subsets of a dataset which, when removed, reverse the sign of a coefficient in an ordinary least squares regression involving that dataset.
    We empirically study the performance of well-established algorithmic techniques for this task -- mixed integer quadratically constrained optimization for general linear regression problems and exact greedy methods for special cases.
    We show that these methods largely outperform the state of the art \cite{broderick2020automatic,moitra2022provably,kuschnig2021hidden} and provide a useful robustness check for regression problems in a few dimensions.
    However, significant computational bottlenecks remain, especially for the important task of disproving the existence of such small sets of influential samples for regression problems of dimension $3$ or greater.
    We make some headway on this challenge via a spectral algorithm using ideas drawn from recent innovations in algorithmic robust statistics.
    We summarize the limitations of known techniques in several challenge datasets to encourage further algorithmic innovation.
