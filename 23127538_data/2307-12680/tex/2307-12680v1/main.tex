\begin{abstract}
    We formulate the \emph{Root Extraction problem} in finite Abelian $p$-groups and then extend it to generic finite Abelian groups. We provide algorithms to solve them. We also give the bounds on the number of group operations required for these algorithms. We observe that once a basis is computed and the discrete logarithm relative to the basis is solved, root extraction takes relatively fewer "bookkeeping" steps. Thus, we conclude that root extraction in finite Abelian groups is \emph{no harder} than solving discrete logarithms and computing basis. %Our results indicate that either discrete logarithms or basis computation in finite Abelian groups of unknown orders have an exponential lower bound.
