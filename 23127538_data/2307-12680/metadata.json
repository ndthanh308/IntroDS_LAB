  "abstract": "We formulate the Root Extraction problem in finite Abelian $p$-groups and then extend it to generic finite Abelian groups. We provide algorithms to solve them. We also give the bounds on the number of group operations required for these algorithms. We observe that once a basis is computed and the discrete logarithm relative to the basis is solved, root extraction takes relatively fewer \"bookkeeping\" steps. Thus, we conclude that root extraction in finite Abelian groups is no harder than solving discrete logarithms and computing basis.",
