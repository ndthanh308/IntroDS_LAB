	abstract = {Quantum simulation using synthetic systems is a promising route to solve outstanding quantum many-body problems in regimes where other approaches, including numerical ones, fail1. Many platforms are being developed towards this goal, in particular based on trapped ions2–4, superconducting circuits5–7, neutral atoms8–11 or molecules12,13. All of these platforms face two key challenges: scaling up the ensemble size while retaining high-quality control over the parameters, and validating the outputs for these large systems. Here we use programmable arrays of individual atoms trapped in optical tweezers, with interactions controlled by laser excitation to Rydberg states11, to implement an iconic many-body problem—the antiferromagnetic two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We push this platform to a regime with up to 196 atoms manipulated with high fidelity and probe the antiferromagnetic order by dynamically tuning the parameters of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the versatility of our platform by exploring various system sizes on two qualitatively different geometries—square and triangular arrays. We obtain good agreement with numerical calculations up to a computationally feasible size (approximately 100 particles). This work demonstrates that our platform can be readily used to address open questions in many-body physics.},

These experiments validate ten year old proposals for Rydberg mediated quantum logic, but are only the beginning of ongoing efforts to improve the fidelity of the results obtained and scale the experiments to larger numbers of qubits. We present here a summary of the results to date, along with a critical evaluation of the prospects for higher fidelity Rydberg gates.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers have the capability of out-performing their classical counterparts for certain computational problems1. Several scalable quantum-computing architectures have been proposed. An attractive architecture is a large set of physically independent qubits arranged in three spatial regions where (1) the initialized qubits are stored in a register, (2) two qubits are brought together to realize a gate and (3) the readout of the qubits is carried out2,3. For a neutral-atom-based architecture, a natural way to connect these regions is to use optical tweezers to move qubits within the system. In this letter we demonstrate the coherent transport of a qubit, encoded on an atom trapped in a submicrometre tweezer, over a distance typical of the separation between atoms in an array of optical traps4,5,6. Furthermore, we transfer a qubit between two tweezers, and show that this manipulation also preserves the coherence of the qubit.},

abstract = {Realizing quantum speedup for practically relevant, computationally hard problems is a central challenge in quantum information science. Using Rydberg atom arrays with up to 289 qubits in two spatial dimensions, we experimentally investigate quantum algorithms for solving the maximum independent set problem. We use a hardware-efficient encoding associated with Rydberg blockade, realize closed-loop optimization to test several variational algorithms, and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of graphs with programmable connectivity. We find that the problem hardness is controlled by the solution degeneracy and number of local minima, and we experimentally benchmark the quantum algorithm’s performance against classical simulated annealing. On the hardest graphs, we observe a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact solutions in the deep circuit regime and analyze its origins. Realizing quantum speedup for solving practical, computationally hard problems is the central challenge in quantum information science. Ebadi et al. used Rydberg atom arrays composed of up to 289 coupled qubits in two spatial dimensions to investigate quantum optimization algorithms for solving the maximum independent set, a paradigmatic nondeterministic polynomial time–hard combinatorial optimization problem (see the Perspective by Schleier-Smith). A hardware-efficient encoding protocol associated with Rydberg blockade was used to realize a closed-loop optimization method to test several variational algorithms and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of nonplanar graphs with programmable connectivity. The results demonstrate the potential of quantum machines as a tool for the discovery of new promising algorithm classes. —ISO Rydberg atom arrays provide quantum speed-up for solving computationally hard optimization problems.}}
