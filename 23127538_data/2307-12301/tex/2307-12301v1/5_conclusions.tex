This paper presents a novel image OD algorithm called RANSAC-NN. Unlike past approaches, our algorithm is completely unsupervised and does not require any training or annotations to achieve quality OD performance. We evaluated RANSAC-NN alongside several OD algorithms on 15 diverse datasets, and our method ranked first in almost every dataset category. Further experimentation demonstrated the consistent performance of our algorithm across different levels of outlier presence with various feature extractors. Ablation studies have also been conducted to analyze the different properties of RANSAC-NN.


Future works may involve optimizing RANSAC-NN to detect outlier images with larger batch sizes. Performance improvements may also be achieved by replacing existing computations (e.g., nearest neighbor similarity) with approximation methods. The incorporation of human supervision may also be explored to achieve semi-supervised image OD.
