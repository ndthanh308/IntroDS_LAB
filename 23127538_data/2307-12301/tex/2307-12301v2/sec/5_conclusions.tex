\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we introduced RANSAC-NN, an unsupervised image OD algorithm that is robust in detecting outliers within contaminated image sets. Unlike past methods that require training a model on a clean dataset, our algorithm does not involve any training, and it maintains a competitive performance compared to other model-based OD methods.

We highlighted the importance of training OD models on a clean inlier set by demonstrating the deteriorative influence of contaminated training. We then explored the use of RANSAC-NN an an outlier removal mechanism. We validated its effectiveness on existing OD algorithms by improving their performance in the contamination setting. To understand why our algorithm works well with contaminated sets, we conducted a detailed analysis of the different properties of the RANSAC-NN components. 

Future works may include extending RANSAC-NN into other domains such as natural language processing or speech recognition. Possible applications in image mislabeled detection may also be explored (see Appendix). With the promising results thus far, we believe RANSAC-NN may serve as an essential component for future image OD tasks.

% We believe our algorithm is an ideal choice image data cleaning tasks, and it has the potential to be paired with existing OD algorithms to form a fully-automated image OD pipeline.
