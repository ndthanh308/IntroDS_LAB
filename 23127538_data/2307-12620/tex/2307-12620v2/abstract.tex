Extensions of Answer Set Programming with language constructs from temporal logics,
such as temporal equilibrium logic over finite traces (\TELf), provide an expressive
computational framework for modeling dynamic applications.
In this paper, we study the so-called past-present syntactic subclass, which consists
of a set of logic programming rules whose body references to the past and head to
the present. Such restriction ensures that the past remains independent of the future,
which is the case in most dynamic domains.
We extend the definitions of completion and loop formulas to the case of past-present
formulas, which allows for capturing the temporal stable models of past-present temporal programs by
means of an \LTLf~expression.
