\section{Conclusions}\label{sec5-conclusions}

We presented BIP! NDR, a dataset created using text analysis techniques
on the DBLP database to extract citation information from the full text of the Open Access papers that do not have an assigned DOI. The dataset 
offers over 500K citations from Computer Science papers that do not have DOIs, addressing a significant limitation of widely used citation datasets in the field, that fail to cover them. As a result, it enables more comprehensive and accurate research assessment in Computer Science. In the future, we plan to improve the workflow so that it can identify more Open Source publications and to extend the dataset so that it can offer additional metadata for each citation (e.g., a class according to a citation classification algorithm).
