\caption{Data structure of the BIP! NDR dataset.}\label{tab:dataset-structure}
\end{figure*}

In this section we present the structure of the dataset along with some basic statistics of the current version. 
The dataset is formatted as a JSON Lines (JSONL)\footnote{JSON Lines data format: \href{https://jsonlines.org/}{jsonlines.org}} file where each line contains a valid JSON object. This file format 
enables file splitting and data streaming as the dataset grows in size. 
An indicative record (in JSON format) of the BIP! NDR dataset is depicted in Figure~\ref{tab:dataset-structure}.

Each JSON object has the following three main fields:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
  % The first field is 
  \texttt{\_id}~--~the unique identifier of each entry
  \item 
  % The second field is the 
  \texttt{citing\_paper}~--~an object holding the \texttt{dblp\_id} of each citing paper
  \item 
  % The third field is called 
  \texttt{cited\_papers}~--~
  % and is 
  an array that contains the objects that correspond to each reference found in the text of the \texttt{citing\_paper}. Each object of the array may contain some or all of the following fields: 
  
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item \texttt{dblp\_id}~--~the dblp\_id of the cited paper
      \item \texttt{doi}~--~the doi of the cited paper
      \item \texttt{bibliographic\_reference}~--~the raw citation string as it appears in the citing paper
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Note that not all the aforementioned fields in ($3$) are required for a \texttt{cited\_paper} to be valid.
Specifically,
one of the \texttt{dblp\_id} or \texttt{doi} identifiers is required for a cited paper to be added in the collection. 
Finally, the \texttt{bibliographic\_reference} exists in all cited\_paper objects since it is extracted directly from the PDF files of each citing paper in the dataset.

Table~\ref{tab:stats}~summarises some statistics about the BIP! NDR dataset. In particular, $59,663$ full texts from Open Access papers were parsed. A total of $1,054,107$ references were evaluated, and among them, $511,842$ references were successfully matched with corresponding keys from the DBLP database. Additionally, $366,106$ DOIs were successfully matched with these DBLP keys. Finally, there were $22,569$ DOIs that could not be matched with any DBLP key, indicating that they have not been indexed by DBLP.
