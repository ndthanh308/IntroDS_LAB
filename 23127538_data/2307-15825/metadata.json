  "abstract": "By recent work of Afandi, it is known that tautological intersection numbers on the moduli space of stable $n$-pointed genus $g$ curves can be arranged into families of Ehrhart polynomials, $\\{L_{\\vec{d}}\\}$, for partial polytopal complexes. In particular, the $f^*$-vector of $L_{\\vec{d}}$ is known to be integral and non-negative. In this paper, we show that both the $f^*$-vector and $h^*$-vector have an enumerative interpretation in the special case that $\\vec{d} = (1, 1, \\dots, 1)$. The $f^*$-vector counts order-consecutive partition sequences of $[n+1]$ and the $h^*$-vector is a binomial coefficient. Furthermore, we conjecture that, for all $\\vec{d}$, the $f^*$-vector of $L_{\\vec{d}}$ always forms a log-concave sequence, and we verify this conjecture in the case that $\\vec{d} = (1, 1, \\dots, 1)$.",
