	title = {Toward best practice framing of uncertainty in scientific publications: {A} review of {Water} {Resources} {Research} abstracts},
	doi = {10.1002/2017WR020609},
	abstract = {Uncertainty is recognized as a key issue in water resources research, among other sciences. Discussions of uncertainty typically focus on tools and techniques applied within an analysis, e.g., uncertainty quantification and model validation. But uncertainty is also addressed outside the analysis, in writing scientific publications. The language that authors use conveys their perspective of the role of uncertainty when interpreting a claim-what we call here ''framing'' the uncertainty. This article promotes awareness of uncertainty framing in four ways. (1) It proposes a typology of eighteen uncertainty frames, addressing five questions about uncertainty. (2) It describes the context in which uncertainty framing occurs. This is an interdisciplinary topic, involving philosophy of science, science studies, linguistics , rhetoric, and argumentation. (3) We analyze the use of uncertainty frames in a sample of 177 abstracts from the Water Resources Research journal in 2015. This helped develop and tentatively verify the typology, and provides a snapshot of current practice. (4) We make provocative recommendations to achieve a more influential, dynamic science. Current practice in uncertainty framing might be described as carefully considered incremental science. In addition to uncertainty quantification and degree of belief (present in 5\% of abstracts), uncertainty is addressed by a combination of limiting scope, deferring to further work (25\%) and indicating evidence is sufficient (40\%)-or uncertainty is completely ignored (8\%). There is a need for public debate within our discipline to decide in what context different uncertainty frames are appropriate. Uncertainty framing cannot remain a hidden practice evaluated only by lone reviewers. Plain Language Summary Scientists address uncertainty not only in how they perform analyses, but also in how they write about their results. Not enough attention has been given to the ways in which scientists describe how uncertainty affects interpretation of their conclusions, which we call ''uncertainty frames.'' We aim to raise awareness of this issue by: (1) proposing a typology of eighteen uncertainty frames, addressing five questions about uncertainty, (2) describing the factors that affect how uncertainty is framed, (3) describing current practice by identifying and analyzing what frames are used in a sample of abstracts published in Water Resources Research in 2015, and (4) providing provocative recommendations on how uncertainty communication could improve. We hope to spark debate within our community about how scientists should be communicating the role of uncertainty in their results.},

In this study, a corpus of 80 articles published in the British Medical Journal for over 167 years (1840-2007) is analysed by focusing on three categories of uncertainty markers, which explicitly reveal a writer's subjectivity: (1) I/we epistemic verbs; (2) I/we modal verbs; and (3) epistemic non-verbs conveying personal opinions. The quantitative analysis shows their progressive decrease over time, which can be due to several variables, including the evolution of medical knowledge and practice, changes in medical research and within the scientific community, and more stringent guidelines for the scientific writing (regarding types of articles, their structure and rhetorical style).},

	abstract = {Recent work in computational linguistics points out the need for systems to be sensitive to the veracity or factuality of events as mentioned in text; that is, to recognize whether events are presented as corresponding to actual situations in the world, situations that have not happened, or situations of uncertain interpretation. Event factuality is an important aspect of the representation of events in discourse, but the annotation of such information poses a representational challenge, largely because factuality is expressed through the interaction of numerous linguistic markers and constructions. Many of these markers are already encoded in existing corpora, albeit in a somewhat fragmented way. In this article, we present FactBank, a corpus annotated with information concerning the factuality of events. Its annotation has been carried out from a descriptive framework of factuality grounded on both theoretical findings and data analysis. FactBank is built on top of TimeBank, adding to it an additional level of semantic information. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

	abstract = {Distinguishing certain and uncertain information is of crucial importance both in the scientific field in the strict sense and in the popular scientific domain. In this paper, by adopting an epistemic stance perspective on certainty and uncertainty, and a mixed procedure of analysis, which combines a bottom-up and a top-down approach, we perform a comparative study (both qualitative and quantitative) of the uncertainty linguistic markers (verbs, non-verbs, modal verbs, conditional clauses, uncertain questions, epistemic future) and their scope in three different corpora: a historical corpus of 80 biomedical articles from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) 1840–2007; a corpus of 12 biomedical articles from BMJ 2013, and a contemporary corpus of 12 scientific popular articles from Discover 2013. The variables under observation are time, structure (IMRaD vs no-IMRaD) and genre (scientific vs popular articles). We apply the Generalized Linear Models analysis in order to test whether there are statistically significant differences (1) in the amount of uncertainty among the different corpora, and (2) in the categories of uncertainty markers used by writers. The results of our analysis reveal that (1) in all corpora, the percentages of uncertainty are always much lower than that of certainty; (2) uncertainty progressively diminishes over time in biomedical articles (in conjunction with their structural changes–IMRaD–and to the increase of the BMJ Impact Factor); and (3) uncertainty is slightly higher in scientific popular articles (Discover 2013) as compared to the contemporary corpus of scientific articles (BMJ 2013). Nevertheless, in all corpora, modal verbs are the most used uncertainty markers. These results suggest that not only do scientific writers prefer to communicate their uncertainty with markers of possibility rather than those of subjectivity but also that science journalists prefer using a third-person subject followed by modal verbs rather than a first-person subject followed by mental verbs such as think or believe.},

	abstract = {Background: Detecting uncertain and negative assertions is essential in most BioMedical Text Mining tasks where, in general, the aim is to derive factual knowledge from textual data. This article reports on a corpus annotation project that has produced a freely available resource for research on handling negation and uncertainty in biomedical texts (we call this corpus the BioScope corpus).
Results: The corpus consists of three parts, namely medical free texts, biological full papers and biological scientific abstracts. The dataset contains annotations at the token level for negative and speculative keywords and at the sentence level for their linguistic scope. The annotation process was carried out by two independent linguist annotators and a chief linguist – also responsible for setting up the annotation guidelines – who resolved cases where the annotators disagreed. The resulting corpus consists of more than 20.000 sentences that were considered for annotation and over 10\% of them actually contain one (or more) linguistic annotation suggesting negation or uncertainty.
Conclusion: Statistics are reported on corpus size, ambiguity levels and the consistency of annotations. The corpus is accessible for academic purposes and is free of charge. Apart from the intended goal of serving as a common resource for the training, testing and comparing of biomedical Natural Language Processing systems, the corpus is also a good resource for the linguistic analysis of scientific and clinical texts.},

The aim was to see if personal and impersonal authorial references, as realized by the rhetorical options chosen, are predisposed to diﬀerences across disciplinary rhetorical cultures. The results indicated disciplinary variations in both the frequency and use of personal and impersonal authorial references, especially when the disciplines were compared for contrasting eﬀects. While the applied linguistics and psychology writers favoured the use of exclusive ﬁrst-person plural pronouns to construct their authorial persona, the environmental engineering and chemistry writers preferred a more detached interpersonal style by opting predominantly for periphrastic passives. Also, the results showed diﬀerences in the incidence of use of personal and impersonal authorial references across discourse functions, which could be attributed to the adoption of diﬀerent interpersonal strategies within the disciplines. The present results are expected to extend our understanding of disciplinary variations towards the use of authorial references in tandem with discourse functions in research articles in the selected disciplines, particularly in the relatively unexplored disciplines of chemistry and environmental engineering.},

	abstract = {Hedging refers to linguistic strategies that qualify categorical commitment to express possibility rather than certainty. In scientific writing, hedging is central to effective argument: Hedging is a rhetorical means of gaining reader acceptance of claims, allowing writers to convey their attitude to the truth of their statements and to anticipate possible objections. Because hedges allow writers to express claims with precision, caution, and modesty, they are a significant resource for academics. However, little is known about the way hedging is typically expressed in particular domains or the particular functions it serves in different genres. This article identifies the major forms, functions, and distribution of hedges in a corpus of 26 molecular biology research articles and describes the importance of hedging in this genre.},

	abstract = {In Ignorance and Uncertainty: Emerging Paradigms, Australian sociologist Michael Smithson observes that Western intellectuals, who once preoccupied themselves with knowledge, are increasingly pondering ignorance. Those who are not, he adds, should consider doing so. It is an arresting suggestion, not unlike the one art instructors often make to students of drawing: do not look at the figure; look at the space around the figure. Once attention is focused on ignorance rather than on knowledge, one begins to see that ignorance is not the simple absence of knowledge. Instead, like the space around objects, ignorance has its own configurations. It varies in amount, form, and substance, depending on the perspective. And just as artists make use of the representational power of space, scientists and nonscientists alike often manipulate ignorance, maximizing or minimizing it in ways that affect the credibility of what we know. In developing this argument, the article draws on the insights of historians, philosophers, mass communications and legal scholars, discourse analysts, and sociologists of science to examine scientists' use of ignorance claims in the construction of science and in science for public policy. It also looks at how nonscientists sometimes appropriate and attempt to manipulate such claims, often through the news media. Such uses, the article argues, reflect and serve claimants' interests. The news media, in turn, appropriate and emphasize those ignorance claims that advance and protect their own particular concerns.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty is involved in many real phenomena. Whether one considers uncertainty explicitly when modeling such a phenomenon is one of the modeling decisions, the result of which will depend on the context. If, however, the modeler decides to consider uncertainty, he or she will have to select the method for modeling it. Some scientists claim that one theory, e.g. probability theory, is sufficient to model all kinds of uncertainty. Here it is claimed, however, that the choice of the appropriate method is context dependent and an approach is suggested to determine context-dependently a suitable method to model uncertainty.},
