  "abstract": "We propose cryptographic protocols to incorporate time provenance guarantees while meeting confidentiality and controlled sharing needs for research data. We demonstrate the efficacy of these mechanisms by developing and benchmarking a practical tool, GovernR, which furthermore takes into usability issues and is compatible with a popular open-sourced research data storage platform, Dataverse. In doing so, we identify and provide a solution addressing an important gap (though applicable to only niche use cases) in practical research data management.",
