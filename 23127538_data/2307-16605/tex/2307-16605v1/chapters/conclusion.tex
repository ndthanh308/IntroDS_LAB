\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we present VPP, a novel Voxel-Point Progressive Representation method that achieves efficient and universal conditional 3D generation. It supports multiple generation categories and is applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We explore the suitability of different 3D geometric representations and design a VQGAN module tailored for 3D generation. We employ the mask Transformer for generative modeling in both voxel and point stages to attain rapid and parallel generation capability. Notably, VPP is capable of generating high-quality 8K point clouds in less than 0.2 seconds using a single RTX 2080Ti GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VPP exhibits excellent performance in conditional generation, editing, completion, and pretraining.
The problem of generation efficiency and quality remains open in the community, and we hope this work could spur more related research on developing applicable conditional 3D generation methods.
