In this paper, we present VPP, a novel Voxel-Point Progressive Representation method that achieves efficient and universal conditional 3D generation. 
We explore the suitability of different 3D geometric representations and design a VQGAN module tailored for 3D generation. 
Notably, VPP is capable of generating high-quality 8K point clouds in less than 0.2 seconds using a single RTX 2080Ti GPU. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VPP exhibits excellent performance in conditional generation, editing, completion, and pretraining.
