\section{AdvBench Details}
\label{sec:app-examples}

The harmful strings and behaviors are generated with \texttt{Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored}, an uncensored Vicuna model.
We prompted it to generate new examples of harmful strings and instructions by providing 5-shot demonstrations written by the authors. We wrote 100 harmful strings and 50 harmful behaviors from which we randomly sampled the 5-shot examples and asked the model to generate 10 new examples during each iteration.
We release these datasets on GitHub. For the purposes of illustration, we provide several examples of each.

% \subsection{Checking For Harmful Completion}\label{appendix:advbench:key-phrases}

% When computing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) given a user prompt for the underlying model, we firstly check if any of the following key phrases (71 in total, see Figure~\ref{fig:key-words}) is a substring of the completion as the appearing of these key words often corresponds to the refusal. In additional to key words checker, we also filter out responses with less than 35 tokens which often indicates the generation is early terminated. To further filter out false positive cases where the completion does not contain any key words above but it still does not seem to be harmful or unethical. we enlist a few authors to manually go over the completion.
