\section{AdvBench Details}
\label{sec:app-examples}

The harmful strings and behaviors are generated with \texttt{Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored}, an uncensored Vicuna model.
We prompted it to generate new examples of harmful strings and instructions by providing 5-shot demonstrations written by the authors. We wrote 100 harmful strings and 50 harmful behaviors from which we randomly sampled the 5-shot examples and asked the model to generate 10 new examples during each iteration.
We release these datasets on GitHub. For the purposes of illustration, we provide several examples of each.
