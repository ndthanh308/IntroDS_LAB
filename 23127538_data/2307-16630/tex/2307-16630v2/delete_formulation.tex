\section{Problem Formulation}

In this section, we first formally define the threat model and the four word-level operations. Then, we analyze the practicality of this threat model, i.e., whether ChatGPT considers the perturbed samples to be semantically similar to the clean ones. Finally, we illustrate the challenges for certifying these operations. 

% and outline the challenges for certifying the robustness against word operations.
