USAGE:

\bibliographystyle{mybstfile}
\bibliography{IEEEfull,mybibfile}

where the IEEE titles in the .bib database entries use the strings
defined here. e.g.,


   journal = IEEE_J_AC,


to yield "{IEEE} Transactions on Automatic Control"


WARNING: IEEE uses abbreviated journal titles in their bibliographies!
Because this file provides the full titles, you should NOT use this file
for work that is to be submitted to the IEEE.

For IEEE work, you should use the abbreviated titles provided in the
companion file, IEEEabrv.bib.


** NOTES **

 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals - 
    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.

 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.

 3. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
    dating prior to IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).

  abstract  = {Traditional problem determination techniques rely on static dependency models that are difficult to generate accurately in today's large, distributed, and dynamic application environments such as e-commerce systems. In this paper, we present a dynamic analysis methodology that automates problem determination in these environments by 1) coarse-grained tagging of numerous real client requests as they travel through the system and 2) using data mining techniques to correlate the believed failures and successes of these requests to determine which components are most likely to be at fault. To validate our methodology, we have implemented Pinpoint, a framework for root cause analysis on the J2EE platform that requires no knowledge of the application components. Pinpoint consists of three parts: a communications layer that traces client requests, a failure detector that uses traffic-sniffing and middleware instrumentation, and a data analysis engine. We evaluatePinpoint by injecting faults into various application components and show that Pinpoint identifies the faulty components with high accuracy and produces few false-positives.},
