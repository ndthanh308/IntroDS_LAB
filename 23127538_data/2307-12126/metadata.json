  "abstract": "Due to its ubiquitous and contact-free nature, the use of WiFi infrastructure for performing sensing tasks has tremendous potential. However, the channel state information (CSI) measured by a WiFi receiver suffers from errors in both its gain and phase, which can significantly hinder sensing tasks. By analyzing these errors from different WiFi receivers, a mathematical model for these gain and phase errors is developed in this work. Based on these models, several theoretically justified preprocessing algorithms for correcting such errors at a receiver and, thus, obtaining clean CSI are presented. Simulation results show that at typical system parameters, the developed algorithms for cleaning CSI can reduce noise by $40$% and $200$%, respectively, compared to baseline methods for gain correction and phase correction, without significantly impacting computational cost. The superiority of the proposed methods is also validated in a real-world test bed for respiration rate monitoring (an example sensing task), where they improve the estimation signal-to-noise ratio by $20$% compared to baseline methods.",
