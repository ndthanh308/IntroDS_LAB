  "abstract": "We present a study on photonic vertical cavities consisting of nonlinear materials embedded in photonic crystals (PhCs) for resonantly enhancing second harmonic generation (SHG). Previous attempts at SHG in such structures have been limited to efficiencies of 10$^{-7}$ to 10$^{-5}$, but we demonstrate here a high SHG efficiency of 0.28% by constructing a vertical cavity with a lithium niobate membrane placed between two PhCs, which exhibits high quality resonances. Our results open up new possibilities for compact laser frequency converters that could have a revolutionary impact on the fields of nonlinear optics and photonics.",
