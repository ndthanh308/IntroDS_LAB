    abstract = {We describe and report the status of a neutrino-triggered program in IceCube that generates real-time alerts for gamma-ray follow-up observations by  atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes (MAGIC and VERITAS). While IceCube is capable of monitoring the whole sky continuously, high-energy gamma-ray telescopes have  restricted fields of view and in general are  unlikely to be observing a potential neutrino-flaring source at the time such neutrinos are recorded.  The use of neutrino-triggered alerts thus aims at  increasing the availability of simultaneous multi-messenger data during potential neutrino flaring activity, which can increase the discovery  potential and constrain the phenomenological interpretation of the high-energy emission of selected source classes (e.g. blazars).  The requirements of a fast and stable online analysis of potential neutrino signals and its operation are presented, along  with first results of the  program operating between   14 March 2012  and   31  December 2015.}

An associated library of computational algorithms and visualization software supports fast scientific applications executable directly on discretized spherical maps generated from very large volumes of astronomical data. Originally developed to address the data processing and analysis needs of the present generation of cosmic microwave background experiments (e.g., BOOMERANG, WMAP), HEALPix can be expanded to meet many of the profound challenges that will arise in confrontation with the observational output of future missions and experiments, including, e.g., Planck, Herschel, SAFIR, and the Beyond Einstein inflation probe. In this paper we consider the requirements and implementation constraints on a framework that simultaneously enables an efficient discretization with associated hierarchical indexation and fast analysis/synthesis of functions defined on the sphere. We demonstrate how these are explicitly satisfied by HEALPix.}
