  "abstract": "Searches for neutrinos from gravitational wave events have been performed utilizing the wide energy range of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We discuss results from these searches during the third observing run (O3) of the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, including a low-latency follow-up of public candidate alert events in O3, an archival search on high-energy track data, and a low-energy search employing IceCube-DeepCore. The dataset of high-energy tracks is mainly sensitive to muon neutrinos, while the low energy dataset is sensitive to neutrinos of all flavors. In all of these searches, we present upper limits on the neutrino flux and isotropic equivalent energy emitted in neutrinos. We also discuss future plans for additional searches, including extending the low-latency follow-up to the next observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors (O4) and analysis of gravitational wave (GW) events using a high-energy cascade dataset, which are produced by electron neutrino charged-current interactions and neutral-current interactions from neutrinos of all flavors.",
