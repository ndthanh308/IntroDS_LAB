  "abstract": "Increasing individuals' awareness of their own body signals can lead to improved interoception, enabling the brain to estimate current body states more accurately and in a timely manner. However, certain body signals, such as eye movements, often go unnoticed by individuals themselves. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that providing eye-movement-correlated tactile feedback on the body enhances individuals' awareness of their attentive states, subsequently improving attention. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of such feedback in redirecting and enhancing attention, particularly in the presence of distractions during long-duration tasks. Additionally, we observed that people's gaze behaviors changed in response to the tactile feedback, suggesting an increased self-awareness of current eye movements and attentive states. Ultimately, these changes in gaze behaviors contribute to the modulation of attentive states. Our findings highlight the potential of eye-movement-correlated bodily tactile feedback to increase individuals' self-awareness of their eye movements and attentive states. By providing real-time feedback through tactile stimuli, we can actively engage individuals in regulating their attention and enhancing their overall performance.",
