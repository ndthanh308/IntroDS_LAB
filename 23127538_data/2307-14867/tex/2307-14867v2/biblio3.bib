This is the case for a large class of complete distributions as well as certain incomplete distributions. As a byproduct, the results can be used to estimate an upper bound of the diameter of the identified set and to obtain an easy to report estimator of the identified set itself.},

We show that rates of convergence of the estimator are driven by two types of assumptions expressed in a single Hilbert scale. The two assumptions quantify the prior regularity of φ and the prior link existing between T and the Hilbert scale. The approach provides a unified framework that allows us to compare various sets of structural assumptions found in the econometric literature. Moreover, general upper bounds are also derived for the risk of the estimator of the structural function φ as well as that of its derivatives. It is shown that the bounds cover and extend known results given in the literature. Two important applications are also studied. The first is the blind nonparametric deconvolution on the real line, and the second is the estimation of the derivatives of the nonparametric instrumental regression function via an iterative Tikhonov regularization scheme.},

We demonstrate for the case of a binary instrument that our approach allows the correct estimation of regression functions which are not identifiable with the standard model. This is illustrated in computed examples with simulated data.},

This paper provides a recipe for augmenting deep learning methods to accurately characterize such relationships in the presence of instrument variables (IVs) – sources of treatment randomization that are conditionally independent from the outcomes. Our IV specification resolves into two prediction tasks that can be solved with deep neural nets: a first-stage network for treatment prediction and a second-stage network whose loss function involves integration over the conditional treatment distribution. This Deep IV framework allows us to take advantage of off-the-shelf supervised learning techniques to estimate causal effects by adapting the loss function. Experiments show that it outperforms existing machine learning approaches.},

We formulate the linear operator equation as a min-max game, where both 
players are parameterized by neural networks (NNs), and learn the
parameters of these neural networks using the stochastic gradient descent.
We consider both 2-layer and multi-layer NNs with ReLU activation 
functions and prove global convergence in an overparametrized regime, where
the number of neurons is diverging. The results are established using 
techniques from online learning and local linearization of NNs,
and improve in several aspects the current state-of-the-art. For the first

splitting.},

Many problems in econometrics can be stated in the form of inverse problems where the argument itself is a function. For example, consider a nonlinear regression where the functional form is the object of interest. One can readily estimate the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given a vector of instruments. From this estimate, one would like to recover the unknown functional form. This chapter provides an introduction to the estimation of the solution to inverse problems. It focuses mainly on integral equations of the first kind. Solving these equations is particularly challenging as the solution does not necessarily exist, may not be unique, and is not continuous. As a result, a regularized (or smoothed) solution needs to be implemented. We review different regularization methods and study the properties of the estimator. Integral equations of the first kind appear, for example, in the generalized method of moments when the number of moment conditions is infinite, and in the nonparametric estimation of instrumental variable regressions. In the last section of this chapter, we investigate integral equations of the second kind, whose solutions may not be unique but are continuous. Such equations arise when additive models and measurement error models are estimated nonparametrically.},

  abstract = {This paper makes several important contributions to the literature about nonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV) estimation and inference on a structural function h0 and functionals of h0. First, we derive sup-norm convergence rates for computationally simple sieve NPIV (series two-stage least squares) estimators of h0 and its derivatives. Second, we derive a lower bound that describes the best possible (minimax) sup-norm rates of estimating h0 and its derivatives, and show that the sieve NPIV estimator can attain the minimax rates when h0 is approximated via a spline or wavelet sieve. Our optimal sup-norm rates surprisingly coincide with the optimal root-mean-squared rates for severely ill-posed problems, and are only a logarithmic factor slower than the optimal root-mean-squared rates for mildly ill-posed problems. Third, we use our sup-norm rates to establish the uniform Gaussian process strong approximations and the score bootstrap uniform confidence bands (UCBs) for collections of nonlinear functionals of h0 under primitive conditions, allowing for mildly and severely ill-posed problems. Fourth, as applications, we obtain the first asymptotic pointwise and uniform inference results for plug-in sieve t-statistics of exact consumer surplus (CS) and deadweight loss (DL) welfare functionals under low-level conditions when demand is estimated via sieve NPIV. Our real data application of UCBs for exact CS and DL functionals of gasoline demand reveals interesting patterns and is applicable to other goods markets.},

  abstract  = {We suggest a method for monotonizing general kernel-type estimators, for example local linear estimators and Nadaraya .Watson estimators. Attributes of our approach include the fact that it produces smooth estimates, indeed with the same smoothness as the unconstrained estimate. The method is applicable to a particularly wide range of estimator types, it can be trivially modified to render an estimator strictly monotone and it can be employed after the smoothing step has been implemented. Therefore,an experimenter may use his or her favorite kernel estimator, and their favorite bandwidth selector, to construct the basic nonparametric smoother and then use our technique to render it monotone in a smooth way. Implementation involves only an off-the-shelf programming routine. The method is based on maximizing fidelity to the conventional empirical approach, subject to monotonicity.We adjust the unconstrained estimator by tilting the empirical distribution so as to make the least possible change, in the sense of a distance measure, subject to imposing the constraint of monotonicity.},

  abstract = {CVXR is an R package that provides an object-oriented modeling language for convex optimization, similar to CVX, CVXPY, YALMIP, and Convex.jl. It allows the user to formulate convex optimization problems in a natural mathematical syntax rather than the restrictive form required by most solvers. The user specifies an objective and set of constraints by combining constants, variables, and parameters using a library of functions with known mathematical properties. CVXR then applies signed disciplined convex programming (DCP) to verify the problem's convexity. Once verified, the problem is converted into standard conic form using graph implementations and passed to a cone solver such as ECOS or SCS. We demonstrate CVXR's modeling framework with several applications.},
