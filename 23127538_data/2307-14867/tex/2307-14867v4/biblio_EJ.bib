This is the case for a large class of complete distributions as well as certain incomplete distributions. As a byproduct, the results can be used to estimate an upper bound of the diameter of the identified set and to obtain an easy to report estimator of the identified set itself.},

We show that rates of convergence of the estimator are driven by two types of assumptions expressed in a single Hilbert scale. The two assumptions quantify the prior regularity of φ and the prior link existing between T and the Hilbert scale. The approach provides a unified framework that allows us to compare various sets of structural assumptions found in the econometric literature. Moreover, general upper bounds are also derived for the risk of the estimator of the structural function φ as well as that of its derivatives. It is shown that the bounds cover and extend known results given in the literature. Two important applications are also studied. The first is the blind nonparametric deconvolution on the real line, and the second is the estimation of the derivatives of the nonparametric instrumental regression function via an iterative Tikhonov regularization scheme.},

We demonstrate for the case of a binary instrument that our approach allows the correct estimation of regression functions which are not identifiable with the standard model.

This paper provides a recipe for augmenting deep learning methods to accurately characterize such relationships in the presence of instrument variables (IVs) – sources of treatment randomization that are conditionally independent from the outcomes. Our IV specification resolves into two prediction tasks that can be solved with deep neural nets: a first-stage network for treatment prediction and a second-stage network whose loss function involves integration over the conditional treatment distribution. This Deep IV framework allows us to take advantage of off-the-shelf supervised learning techniques to estimate causal effects by adapting the loss function. Experiments show that it outperforms existing machine learning approaches.},

We study estimation in a class of generalized SEMs where the object 
of interest is defined as the solution to a linear operator equation.
We formulate the linear operator equation as a min-max game, where both 
players are parameterized by neural networks (NNs), and learn the
parameters of these neural networks using the stochastic gradient descent.
We consider both 2-layer and multi-layer NNs with ReLU activation 
functions and prove global convergence in an overparametrized regime, where
the number of neurons is diverging. The results are established using 
techniques from online learning and local linearization of NNs,
and improve in several aspects the current state-of-the-art. For the first 
time we provide a tractable estimation procedure for SEMs
based on NNs with provable convergence and without the need for sample
splitting.},

Attributes of our approach include the fact that it produces smooth estimates, indeed with the same smoothness as the unconstrained estimate. The method is applicable to a particularly wide range of estimator types, it can be trivially modified to render an estimator strictly monotone and it can be employed after the smoothing step has been implemented. Therefore,an experimenter may use his or her favorite kernel estimator, and their favorite bandwidth selector, to construct the basic nonparametric smoother and then use our technique to render it monotone in a smooth way. Implementation involves only an off-the-shelf programming routine. The method is based on maximizing fidelity to the conventional empirical approach, subject to monotonicity.We adjust the unconstrained estimator by tilting the empirical distribution so as to make the least possible change, in the sense of a distance measure, subject to imposing the constraint of monotonicity.},

It allows the user to formulate convex optimization problems in a natural mathematical syntax rather than the restrictive form required by most solvers. The user specifies an objective and set of constraints by combining constants, variables, and parameters using a library of functions with known mathematical properties. CVXR then applies signed disciplined convex programming (DCP) to verify the problem's convexity. Once verified, the problem is converted into standard conic form using graph implementations and passed to a cone solver such as ECOS or SCS. We demonstrate CVXR's modeling framework with several applications.},

We propose exact likelihood and restricted likelihood ratio tests for testing polynomial regression versus a general alternative modelled by penalised splines. Their spectral decompositions are used as the basis of fast simulation algorithms. We derive the asymptotic local power properties of the tests under weak conditions. In particular we characterise the local alternatives that are detected with asymptotic probability one. Confidence intervals for the smoothing parameter are obtained by inverting the tests for a fixed smoothing parameter versus a general alternative. We discuss F and R tests and show that ignoring the variability in the smoothing parameter estimator can have a dramatic effect on their null distributions. The powers of several known tests are investigated and a small set of tests with good power properties is identified. The restricted likelihood ratio test is among the best in terms of power.},

We explore a class of quantile smoothing splines, defined as solutions to ming{$\in$}G {$\sum$} {$\rho\tau$} \{yi - g(xi)\} + {$\lambda$} ({$\int$}1 0 |g''(x)|p dx)1/p, with \${\textbackslash}rho\_{\textbackslash}tau(u) = u{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}tau - I(u {$<$} 0){\textbackslash}\}, p {\textbackslash}geqslant 1\$, and appropriately chosen G. For the particular choices p = 1 and p = {$\infty$} we characterise solutions {\^g} as splines, and discuss computation by standard l1-type linear programming techniques. At {$\lambda$} = 0, {\^g} interpolates the {$\tau$}th quantiles at the distinct design points, and for {$\lambda$} sufficiently large {\^g} is the linear regression quantile fit (Koenker \& Bassett, 1978) to the observations. Because the methods estimate conditional quantile functions they possess an inherent robustness to extreme observations in the yi's. The entire path of solutions, in the quantile parameter {$\tau$}, or the penalty parameter {$\lambda$}, may be efficiently computed by parametric linear programming methods. We note that the approach may be easily adapted to impose monotonicity and/or convexity constraints on the fitted function. An example is provided to illustrate the use of the proposed methods.},

The equivalent kernels we obtain for penalized splines are the same as those found by Silverman for smoothing splines. The asymptotic distribution of the penalized spline estimator is Gaussian and we give simple expressions for the asymptotic mean and variance. Provided that it is fast enough, the rate at which the number of knots converges to infinity does not affect the asymptotic distribution. The optimal rate of convergence of the penalty parameter is given. Penalized splines are not design-adaptive.},

  abstract  = {INTRODUCTIONThe development of nonparametric estimation in econometrics has been extremely important over the past fifteen years. Inference was first concentrated on the data's distribution, described, for example, by its density or by its hazard function, or by some characteristics of the conditional distributions, such as the conditional expectations. This approach is typically a reduced-form analysis oriented to sophisticated data description, even if the selection of conditioning variables may depend on a theoretical model. On the other side, the structural econometric analysis is focused on the estimation of the (possibly functional) parameters that describe the economic agent's behavior and that are not, in general, “simple” transformations of the sampling distribution. An excellent state-of-the-art discussion of nonparametric econometrics is given by Pagan and Ullah (1999) (see also Aït Sahalia (1995) for a general “reduced form analysis” in the nonparametric framework).A first objective of this paper is to introduce a general framework for structural functional inference in connection with the inverse-problems literature. An inverse problem is the resolution of a functional equation with a particular attention to the sensitivity of the solution to possible errors in the specification of the equation due for instance to an estimation procedure (see, e.g., for recent surveys of the literature, Colton et al., 2000).More specifically, we analyze linear inverse problems in which the parameter of interest is a function ϕ solution of a linear equation KFϕ = ψF in which both the linear operator KF and the right-hand side depend on the (unknown) distribution F of the sample.},

Motivated by empirical studies in epidemiology and economics, it also supposes that valid instrumental variables are observed. However, the estimation of a nonparametric regression function by instrumental variables is an ill-posed linear inverse problem with an unknown but estimable operator. We provide a new estimator of the regression function that is based on projection onto finite dimensional spaces and that includes an iterative regularisation method (the Landweber–Fridman method). The optimal number of iterations and the convergence of the mean square error of the resulting estimator are derived under both strong and weak source conditions. A Monte Carlo exercise shows the impact of some parameters on the estimator and concludes on the reasonable finite sample performance of the new estimator.},

Estimators of {$\beta$} based on incorrect parameterization of {\texttheta} are generally inconsistent, whereas consistent nonparametric estimators deviate from {$\beta$} by a larger probability order than N\textsuperscript{-1/2}, where N is sample size. An estimator generalizing the ordinary least squares estimator of {$\beta$} is constructed by inserting nonparametric regression estimators in the nonlinear orthogonal projection on Z. Under regularity conditions {\^undefined} is shown to be {$<$}tex-math{$>\$$}N\^{}\{1/2\}{\textbackslash}text\{-consistent\}\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} for {$\beta$} and asymptotically normal, and a consistent estimator of its limiting covariance matrix is given, affording statistical inference that is not only asymptotically valid but has nonzero asymptotic first-order efficiency relative to estimators based on a correctly parameterized {\texttheta}. We discuss the identification problem and {\^undefined}'s efficiency, and report results of a Monte Carlo study of finite-sample performance. While the paper focuses on the simplest interesting setting of multiple regression with independent observations, extensions to other econometric models are described, in particular seemingly unrelated and nonlinear regressions, simultaneous equations, distributed lags, and sample selectivity models.},

  abstract      = {Penalised spline regression is a popular new approach to smoothing, but its theoretical properties are not yet well understood. In this paper, mean squared error expressions and consistency results are derived by using a white-noise model representation for the estimator. The effect of the penalty on the bias and variance of the estimator is discussed, both for general splines and for the case of polynomial splines. The penalised spline regression estimator is shown to achieve the optimal nonparametric convergence rate established by Stone (1982).},

  abstract  = {This chapter studies the estimation of φ in linear inverse problems Tφ = r, where r is only observed with error and T may be given or estimated. The unknown element φ belongs to a Hilbert space E. Four examples are relevant for econometrics: the density estimation, the deconvolution problem, the linear regression with an infinite number of possibly endogenous explanatory variables, and the nonparametric instrumental variables estimation. In the first two cases T is given, whereas it is estimated in the two other cases, respectively at a parametric or nonparametric rate. This chapter will recall the main results on these models: concepts of degree of ill-posedness, regularity of φ, regularized estimation, and the rates of convergence usually obtained. The main contributions are, moreover, related to the asymptotic normality of the regularized solution φ obtained with a regularization parameter α. If α → 0, we particularly consider the asymptotic normality of inner products \&amp;lt;φ, ϕ\&amp;gt;, where ϕ is an element of E. These results can be used to construct (asymptotic) tests on φ.},
