\section{Conclusion and future work}
Deduplication techniques save storage costs of a cloud storage provider. However, adoption of deduplication techniques by cloud users requires strong incentives and fair payment platform. In this paper, our contributions are two-fold: first, we have designed a new incentive mechanism, and second, we designed a Blockchain-based deduplication scheme. Experiment results show that the proposed incentive mechanism is individually rational and incentive compatible for both CSP and users. The proposed dedup scheme solved the problem of correctness, uniform payments and fair payments in deduplication of cloud data without a trusted intermediary. The designed smart contracts in the proposed scheme are implemented in Ethereum network, and the costs of interacting with the smart contract are presented. The limitation of our scheme is that a malicious CSP may disable the file link after receiving the fee from the contract. In the future, we would like to address this limitation by using deferred payments. Our scheme could serve as a basic model to construct more robust dedup schemes using smart contracts with less number of rounds.
