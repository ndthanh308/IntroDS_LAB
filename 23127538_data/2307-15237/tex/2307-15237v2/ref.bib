Pursuant to California Assembly Bill 2127, evolving market and technology conditions warrant updating this statewide infrastructure assessment at least every two years. EVI-Pro has been updated to consider California's 2030 goal to have 5 million zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) on the road by 2030. CEC and NREL with the support of UC Davis and other state agencies, have set out to refine EVI-Pro to reflect increasing PEV market share, evolving vehicle and charging technology, and observed charging behavior.},
