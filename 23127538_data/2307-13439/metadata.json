  "abstract": "Let $f \\in S_{k}(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}))$ be a normalized Hecke eigenforms of integral weight $k$ for the full modular group. In the article, we study the average behaviour of Fourier coefficients of $\\ell$-fold product $L$-function. More precisely, we establish the asymptotics of power moments associated to the sequence $\\{λ_{f \\otimes f \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes_{\\ell} f}(n)\\}_{n- {\\rm squarefree}}$ where ${f \\otimes f \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes_{\\ell} f}$ denotes the $\\ell$-fold product of $f$. As a consequence, we prove results concerning the behaviour of sign changes associated to these sequences for odd $\\ell$-fold product $L$-function. A similar result also holds for the sequence $\\{λ_{f \\otimes f \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes_{\\ell} f}(n)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$.",
