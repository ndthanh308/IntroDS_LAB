The chart shows the number of COVID-19 cases in the US for a month between February 13, 2020, to March 13, 2020. The number of cases didn't rise dramatically until March 4, 2020, but within the next 10 days, the number was 20 times higher with a steep curve. The reason is probably the US government delaying its effort to control the rise of COVID-19 cases.
