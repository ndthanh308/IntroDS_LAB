\section{Conclusion}
Writing caption text whose emphasis matches chart emphasis is important for communicating the intended message to the reader.
Through a survey of chart-caption pairs in the real world, we find that there is often a mismatch between chart emphasis and caption emphasis. To address this issue, we introduce \toolname{}, a tool to help authors align the message in the caption text with the prominent features in the chart.
The tool comprises the \textit{time-series prominent feature detector} that identifies chart emphasis and performs at the level of prior crowdsourcing algorithm and the \textit{text reference extractor} that extracts text emphasis and matches them with chart emphasis. Based on feedback we collected from users, \toolname{} is both useful and easy to use for writing effective captions. We identify future directions in this space for further supporting chart authors with better caption-writing tools.
