The chart shows us the number of inbound tourist into japan from year 1990 to 2017. We can see that the number of inbound tourist rise dramatically from 2011. This rise was because of tourism policy change by the new government headed by Abe, which made the travelling to japan easier and cheaper. Another time at which the graph started rise was from 2002 to 2008. That was possibly due to FIFA world cup organized by Japan and Korea.
