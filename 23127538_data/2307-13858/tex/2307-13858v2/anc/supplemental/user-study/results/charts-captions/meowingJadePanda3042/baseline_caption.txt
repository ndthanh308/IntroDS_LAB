From 2013, the percentage of Democrats who believe 'climate change is a major threat' continously increased. Starting from 58.0%p on Jan 2013, now 88.0%p of Democrats say that climate change is a major threat. The interesting point is that the value actually decreased from 2009 to 2012. After 2013, the percentage value rapidly increased except some frozen points from 2017 to 2019; even though the percentage itself was super-high during that period.
