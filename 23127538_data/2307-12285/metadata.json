  "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce ACE, a consent-embedded searchable encryption scheme. ACE enables dynamic consent management by supporting the physical deletion of associated data at the time of consent revocation. This ensures instant real deletion of data, aligning with privacy regulations and preserving individuals' rights. We evaluate ACE in the context of genomic databases, demonstrating its ability to perform the addition and deletion of genomic records and related information based on ID, which especially complies with the requirements of deleting information of a particular data owner. To formally prove that ACE is secure under non-adaptive attacks, we present two new definitions of forward and backward privacy. We also define a new hard problem, which we call D-ACE, that facilitates the proof of our theorem (we formally prove its hardness by a security reduction from DDH to D-ACE). We finally present implementation results to evaluate the performance of ACE.",
