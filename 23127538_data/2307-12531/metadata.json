  "abstract": "Measuring the region $0.1 < Q^{2} < 1.0$ GeV$^{2}$ is essential to support searches for gluon saturation at the future Electron-Ion Collider. Recent studies have revealed that covering this region at the highest beam energies is not feasible with current detector designs, resulting in the so-called $Q^{2}$ gap. In this work, we present a design for the Few-Degree Calorimeter (FDC), which addresses this issue. The FDC uses SiPM-on-tile technology with tungsten absorber and covers the range of $-4.6 < η< -3.6$. It offers fine transverse and longitudinal granularity, along with excellent time resolution, enabling standalone electron tagging. Our design represents the first concrete solution to bridge the $Q^{2}$ gap at the EIC.",
