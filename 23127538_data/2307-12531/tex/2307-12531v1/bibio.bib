Such a calorimeter, based on scintillator strips, is being developed to apply particle flow reconstruction to future experiments in high energy physics. The application of this algorithm to 100GeV hadronic jets in an ECAL with 45×5mm2 transverse segmentation improves the energy resolution from 3.6% to 3.0%, to be compared to the resolution of 2.9% achieved by an ECAL with 5×5mm2 segmentation. The performance can be further improved by the use of 10×10mm2 tile-shaped layers interspersed between strip layers.}

The analysis is based on data from the Beam Pipe Calorimeter (BPC) and the Beam Pipe Tracker (BPT). Compared to our previous analysis, the BPT permits improved background suppression and better control of systematic uncertainties, allowing the extension of the kinematic region of the measurement towards lower Q2 as well as higher and lower y. Significant improvements have also been achieved in the simulation of the hadronic final state via a mixture of samples of non-diffractive and diffractive Monte Carlo events, generated by the programs DJANGO and RAPGAP.}

The accumulated doses measured at the front side of the BPC during the HERA runs 1995, 1996 and 1997 were 12 kGy, 11 kGy and 2.5 kGy, respectively. The radiation dose influenced the optical components of the BPC. The degradation of some of the scintillators due to radiation damage has been examined using different monitoring systems. A simulation code was developed which describes quantitatively the effects of non-uniform radiation damage. The following report describes the radiation monitoring, the effects on the scintillator material and the impact on the energy linearity of the BPC.}

abstract = {The response of the ZEUS sampling calorimeter has been studied over a period of 17 years using a moving 60Co source. The aim was to monitor the stability of the calorimeter with respect to radiation damage, ageing and mechanical damage. The measurements started in 1990 during the installation of the first calorimeter modules and ended in 2007 after the last HERA run. Within the experimental uncertainties, the longitudinal uniformity of the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) based wavelength shifters (Y7) did not change. There is also no evidence for radiation damage in the polystyrene (PS) based scintillators (SCSN-38) due to particle losses of the electron and proton beams. On the other hand, the investigations clearly indicate that the attenuation length of the SCSN-38 scintillators decreased continuously over the years. A comparison with data obtained from a test calorimeter showed that the same effect observed in the ZEUS calorimeter after 17 years would require a uniform exposure of all scintillators by a dose of (2.8±1)kGy of γ rays. However, it can be excluded that the degradation observed in the ZEUS calorimeter can be attributed to the radioactivity of the uranium plates of the calorimeter. Thus we expect that the decrease of the attenuation length is due to ageing of the scintillators. The ageing effects observed in SCSN-38 are compared to data taken from the literature.}
